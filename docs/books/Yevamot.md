| Yevamot 6:6 | and so it is taught | Yevamot 42b:5 | Rabbi Elazar said: <b>From the fact</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan needed to state this, it would seem <b>that</b> there is <b>an individual</b> opinion that <b>disagrees with him,</b> even though no such opinion is mentioned in the mishna. Rabbi Asi answered: <b>Yes,</b> that is correct, <b>and so it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 6:6): With regard to a woman who is certainly not pregnant, for example, a woman who, at the time of her husband’s death, had not lived with her husband for some time because she always eagerly hurried, like <b>one pursued, to go to her father’s house, or because she had</b> been subject to <b>anger in her husband’s house, or because her husband had been incarcerated in prison, or because her husband was elderly or infirm, or because she was infirm.</b> |
| Yevamot 11:3 | Rava raised an objection | Yevamot 20b:4 | <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 11:3): <b>A man with crushed testicles</b> or with other wounds to his genitals <b>or one whose penis has been severed, one who is a eunuch</b> caused <b>by man</b> and not from birth or by disease, or <b>an elderly man,</b> all of whom are incapable of fathering children, <b>one either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage. How so?</b> If any of these infertile men <b>died, and they had brothers and they</b> also <b>had wives,</b> and they then died childless, <b>and the brothers proceeded to perform levirate betrothal with their wives, or gave them a bill of divorce, or performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, whatever they did is done;</b> i.e., their act was effective. <b>And if</b> any one of the brothers <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with the widow of one of those infertile men, he thereby <b>acquired</b> the woman as a wife according to the laws of levirate marriage. |
| Yevamot 14:2 | Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection | Bava Kamma103b:8 | <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection</b> to the explanation that Rabbi Akiva stated his opinion specifically in a case where the robber took an oath. The <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 14:2) states that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva did not disagree with regard to one who purchased</b> an item <b>from</b> one of <b>five</b> people <b>and does not know from which of them he purchased</b> it, as both agree <b>that</b> in this case <b>he places the money of the purchase between them and withdraws.</b> Since the purchaser has not transgressed, he is not penalized by being required to suffer the loss of paying each of them. <b>With regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagree with regard to one <b>who robbed one of five people, and he does not know from which of them he robbed</b> the item, <b>as Rabbi Tarfon says: He places the stolen item between them and withdraws, and Rabbi Akiva says: He has no remedy,</b> i.e., he has not fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item, <b>until he pays</b> the value of <b>the stolen item to each and every one</b> of them. |
