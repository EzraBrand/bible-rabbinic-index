| Isaiah 1:1 | prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [ ḥazon ] of Isaiah ben Amoz” | Bava Batra15b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The generation of Job was awash in licentiousness, as it is stated: “Behold, all of you yourselves have seen [<i>ḥazitem</i>] it; why then have you become altogether vain?”</b> (Job 27:12), <b>and it is written: “Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look [<i>veneḥeze</i>] upon you”</b> (Song of Songs 7:1), which teaches that the phrase “you have seen it” connotes a licentious gaze. The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> that the phrase “you yourselves have seen it” signifies <b>prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [<i>ḥazon</i>] of Isaiah ben Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). The Gemara answers: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the words: <b>“Why then have you become altogether vain”?</b> Rather, the reference must be to inappropriate licentious gazing. |
| Isaiah 1:1 | were brothers, and it is written: “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz” | Megillah 10b:15 | <b>Rather, because she covered her face in the house of her father-in-law and he was not familiar with her</b> appearance, Judah didn’t recognize Tamar, thought she was a harlot, and sought to have sexual relations with her. Ultimately, <b>she merited that kings and prophets emerged from her. Kings</b> emerged from her <b>through David,</b> who was a descendant of Tamar’s son, Peretz. However, there is no explicit mention that she was the forebear of <b>prophets.</b> This is derived from that <b>which Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors. Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers, and it is written: “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). Amoz was a member of the Davidic dynasty, and his son, the prophet Isaiah, was also a descendant of Tamar. |
| Isaiah 1:1 | “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judea and Jerusalem | Pesachim 87b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Woe to authority, which</b> shortens the life and <b>buries its holders.</b> This is evident from the fact <b>that you don’t have any prophet who did not outlast four kings in his lifetime,</b> as the kings’ positions of authority caused them to die young. A prophet outliving four kings is demonstrated in the opening verses of Hosea, and similarly, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Isaiah: <b>“The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judea and Jerusalem</b> in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judea” (Isaiah 1:1). |
| Isaiah 1:1 | as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz” | Sotah 10b:3 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The verse means <b>that</b> Tamar <b>covered her face in the home of her father-in-law,</b> Judah. Therefore, he did not recognize her when her face was uncovered. <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Any daughter-in-law who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar. Prophets</b> emerged from her, <b>as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). <b>Kings</b> emerged from her, as seen <b>from David. And Rabbi Levi says: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers.</b> This indicates that Isaiah was also from the house of David and therefore a descendant of Tamar. |
| Isaiah 1:3 | “The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s trough; but Israel does not know, | Makkot 23a:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And two straps</b> go up and down the doubled strap of calf hide. The Sage <b>taught: And</b> they are straps <b>of donkey</b> hide. <b>As a certain Galilean interpreted before Rav Ḥisda:</b> It is written: <b>“The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s trough; but Israel does not know,</b> My people does not consider” (Isaiah 1:3). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Let the one who recognizes its master’s trough,</b> an ox and donkey, <b>come and exact retribution,</b> through lashes with a strap of ox and donkey hide, <b>from one who does not recognize his Master’s trough</b> and performs transgressions. |
| Isaiah 1:4 | And it states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly” | Kiddushin 36a:12 | <b>And Rabbi Meir says: Either way you are</b> still <b>called sons, as it is stated: “They are foolish sons”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22). <b>And it</b> also <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:20). <b>And it states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly”</b> (Isaiah 1:4). <b>And it states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God”</b> (Hosea 2:1). |
| Isaiah 1:9 | As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom, | Berakhot 19a:21 | <b>And Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which <b>it</b> is derived? <b>As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom,</b> we should have been like unto Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). |
| Isaiah 1:9 | As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah” | Berakhot 60a:25 | <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah”</b> (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). After the analogy to Sodom was raised, it was realized. |
| Isaiah 1:9 | “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah” | Ketubot 8b:9 | <b>Abaye said</b> with regard to the statement concerning the mourners: <b>Let him say: Many have drunk; let him not say: Many will drink. Let him say: The drink of the first; let him not say: The drink of the last.</b> This is <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, and likewise it was taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei: A person should never open his mouth to Satan</b> and speculate about potential disasters. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah”</b> (Isaiah 1:9), after which, <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). Isaiah drew the analogy and immediately it was realized. |
| Isaiah 1:10 | reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom; | Berakhot 19a:21 | <b>And Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which <b>it</b> is derived? <b>As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom,</b> we should have been like unto Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). |
| Isaiah 1:10 | reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom; | Berakhot 60a:25 | <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah”</b> (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10).

Isaiah drew the analogy and immediately it was realized. |
| Isaiah 1:11 | Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me, | Berakhot 32b:3 | In another comparison, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me,</b> says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not desire the blood of bulls and sheep and goats” (Isaiah 1:11). <b>And</b> several verses later <b>it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands</b> I will hide My eyes from you, and even if you increase your prayer, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). Not only Israel’s sacrifices, but even their prayers, which are on a higher spiritual level, will not be accepted. |
| Isaiah 1:11 | distance himself from him? As it is written: “To what purpose is the multitude of your offerings to Me? says the Lord” | Chagigah 4b:7 | <b>Similarly, when Rav Huna reached this verse, he cried: “And you shall sacrifice peace</b>-offerings, <b>and you shall eat there”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). Can it happen to <b>a slave whose master expects</b> him <b>to eat at his table,</b> that his master <b>will</b> eventually <b>distance himself from him? As it is written: “To what purpose is the multitude of your offerings to Me? says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 1:11). |
| Isaiah 1:12 | As it is written: “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?” | Chagigah 4b:1 | <b>a delicate</b> man, who cannot walk without shoes. <b>As it is written: “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?”</b> (Isaiah 1:12). Entering the Temple with shoes is described by the prophet as trampling, and therefore one who cannot enter barefoot is exempt from the mitzva of appearance. |
| Isaiah 1:12 | As it is written: “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?” | Chagigah 4b:6 | The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Huna reached this verse,</b> which can be read as: <b>“Will see” [<i>yireh</i>]</b> and <b>“shall appear” [<i>yera’e</i>], he cried. He said:</b> Can it happen to <b>a slave whose master expects to see him,</b> that the master <b>will</b> eventually <b>distance himself from him</b> and not want him anymore? <b>As it is written: “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?”</b> (Isaiah 1:12). |
| Isaiah 1:14 | “Your New Moons and your Festivals, My soul hated; they were a burden to Me” | Megillah 31b:1 | When the <b>New Moon of Av occurs on Shabbat, they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion that includes the verse <b>“Your New Moons and your Festivals, My soul hated; they were a burden to Me”</b> (Isaiah 1:14). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“They were a burden to Me”?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: It is not enough for the Jewish people that they sin before Me, but</b> in addition, <b>they burden Me to reconsider what harsh decree I shall bring upon them,</b> for they are petitioning Me to annul those decrees. |
| Isaiah 1:14 | written: “My soul hates your New Moons and your Festivals; they are a burden to Me; | Shabbat 145b:14 | Rabbi Yoḥanan continued to answer the questions of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi: <b>For what</b> reason are the <b>Festivals in Babylonia more joyous</b> than those in Eretz Yisrael? <b>Because they were not</b> included <b>in that curse</b> with which Eretz Yisrael was cursed, <b>as it is written: “And I will cause all of her happiness to cease, her Festival, her New Moon, and her Shabbat and all her Festivals”</b> (Hosea 2:13). <b>And it is</b> also <b>written: “My soul hates your New Moons and your Festivals; they are a burden to Me;</b> I am weary to bear them” (Isaiah 1:14). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“They are a burden to me”? Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Is it not enough for the Jewish people that they sin before Me, that they</b> also <b>burden Me to know which harsh decree I will bring upon them? Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> Because of this curse, <b>there is not a single Festival on which troops did not come to Tzippori</b> to conduct searches or to collect taxes. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: There is not a single Festival on which an <i>egmon</i> and a <i>kamton</i> and a branch bearer,</b> Roman officials, <b>did not come to Tiberias</b> to collect taxes, thereby disrupting the festive celebrations. |
| Isaiah 1:15 | it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands | Berakhot 32b:3 | In another comparison, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me,</b> says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not desire the blood of bulls and sheep and goats” (Isaiah 1:11). <b>And</b> several verses later <b>it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands</b> I will hide My eyes from you, and even if you increase your prayer, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). Not only Israel’s sacrifices, but even their prayers, which are on a higher spiritual level, will not be accepted. |
| Isaiah 1:15 | your hands are full of blood” | Niddah 13b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says,</b> with regard to the severity of this transgression: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; even when you make many prayers, I will not hear; <b>your hands are full of blood”</b> (Isaiah 1:15)? <b>These are</b> those men <b>who commit adultery with the hand,</b> by masturbating. Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When it is stated in the Ten Commandments: <b>“You shall not commit adultery”</b> (Exodus 20:13), this means that <b>there shall not be adultery among you, whether</b> you masturbate <b>by hand</b> or <b>whether with</b> one’s <b>foot.</b> |
| Isaiah 1:17 | from here: “Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed [ ḥamotz ]” | Kiddushin 53a:10 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: What is the verse</b> from which is derived that <i>ḥamtzan</i> means one who snatches? The verse states: <b>“My God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and grasping man [<i>ḥometz</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:4). <b>Rabba said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17), i.e., restore property stolen from victims of theft. |
| Isaiah 1:17 | relieve [ ashru ] the oppressed [ ḥamotz ]” | Sanhedrin 35a:6 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The verse states</b> prophetically concerning Jerusalem after the destruction of the First Temple: <b>“She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers”</b> (Isaiah 1:21). The verse associates lodging, or waiting overnight, with justice. <b>And Rava says</b> that these matters are derived <b>from here:</b> “Learn to do well; seek judgment, <b>relieve [<i>ashru</i>] the oppressed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17). This is interpreted: <b>Praise [<i>ashru</i>]</b> the <b>judge who delays [<i>meḥametz</i>] his verdict</b> before he pronounces it. |
| Isaiah 1:17 | Rava said: From here: “Learn to do well, seek justice, strengthen the robbed [ ḥamotz ]” | Yoma 39b:2 | <b>Rabba bar bar Sheila said: What is the verse</b> that indicates that a <i>ḥamtzan</i> is a robber? The verse states: <b>“O, my God, rescue me out of the hand of wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and robbing man [<i>ḥometz</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:4). <b>Rava said: From here: “Learn to do well, seek justice, strengthen the robbed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17), which teaches that one should <b>strengthen the robbed, but not strengthen the robber.</b> |
| Isaiah 1:18 | his transgressions have been forgiven, | Berakhot 57a:18 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak taught: One who lets blood in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his transgressions have been forgiven,</b> because red, the color of blood, is a metaphor for sin: “Though your sins be as scarlet…though they be red like crimson” (Isaiah 1:18). Consequently, bloodletting can symbolize transgressions leaving him. |
| Isaiah 1:18 | As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow” | Shabbat 86a:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the third day</b> after relations <b>is ritually impure,</b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days,</b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the third day,</b> meaning the third day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The mishna cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water. |
| Isaiah 1:18 | that one ties a scarlet strip | Shabbat 89b:2 | We learned in the mishna: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool to the scapegoat? As it says: “If your sins be like scarlet [<i>kashanim</i>], they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). The Gemara wonders at this: Why does the verse use the plural form: <b><i>Kashanim</i>? It should have</b> used the singular form: <b><i>Kashani</i>. Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people:</b> Even <b>if your sins are</b> as numerous <b>as those years [<i>kashanim</i>] that have proceeded continuously from the six days of Creation until now, they will become white like snow. Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Go please and let us reason together, the Lord will say”</b> (Isaiah 1:18)? Why does the verse say: <b>Go please? It should have</b> said: <b>Come please.</b> And why does the verse say: <b>The Lord will say?</b> The prophet’s message is based on something that God already said. Therefore, the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b>God said.</b> Rather, the explanation of this verse is that <b>in the future</b> that will surely <b>come, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will say to the Jewish people: Go please to your Patriarchs, and they will rebuke you.</b> |
| Isaiah 1:18 | turned white, | Yoma 39a:15 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> During all <b>forty years that Shimon HaTzaddik served</b> as High Priest, <b>the lot</b> for God arose in <b>the right</b> hand. <b>From then onward, sometimes it arose in the right</b> hand and <b>sometimes it arose in the left</b> hand. Furthermore, during his tenure as High Priest, <b>the strip of crimson</b> wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel <b>turned white,</b> indicating that the sins of the people had been forgiven, as it is written: “Though your sins be as crimson, they shall be white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18). <b>From then onward, it sometimes turned white</b> and <b>sometimes it did not turn white.</b> Furthermore, <b>the western lamp</b> of the candelabrum <b>would burn</b> continuously as a sign that God’s presence rested upon the nation. <b>From then onward, it sometimes burned</b> and <b>sometimes it went out.</b> |
| Isaiah 1:18 | is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow; | Yoma 67a:10 | <b>Rabbi Naḥum bar Pappa said in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar: At first they would tie the strip of crimson to the opening of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple <b>on the inside, and when the goat reached the wilderness,</b> the strip of crimson <b>would turn white, and they knew that the mitzva was fulfilled.</b> The verse alludes to the use of the strip of crimson, as it <b>is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow;</b> though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool” (Isaiah 1:18). This verse indicates that when something scarlet turns white, it is a sign of atonement and forgiveness for the sins of the Jewish people. |
| Isaiah 1:18 | the strip would turn white, as it is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow” | Yoma 68b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Didn’t they have a different indicator? There was a strip of crimson tied to the entrance to the Sanctuary, and when</b> the <b>goat reached the wilderness</b> and the mitzva was fulfilled <b>the strip would turn white, as it is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). |
| Isaiah 1:19 | that it is written: “If you are willing and obedient | Kiddushin 61b:14 | The Gemara again inquires: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you are willing and obedient</b> you shall eat the good of the land” (Isaiah 1:19), whereas: <b>“But if you refuse and rebel</b> you shall be devoured by the sword” (Isaiah 1:20). <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need the double formulation? The Gemara answers in a similar fashion: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: “If you are willing”</b> you will receive <b>good,</b> i.e., reward, <b>“but if you refuse”</b> you will receive <b>neither good nor bad.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, and one who rebels will receive punishment. |
| Isaiah 1:20 | “But if you refuse and rebel | Kiddushin 61b:14 | The Gemara again inquires: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you are willing and obedient</b> you shall eat the good of the land” (Isaiah 1:19), whereas: <b>“But if you refuse and rebel</b> you shall be devoured by the sword” (Isaiah 1:20). <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need the double formulation? The Gemara answers in a similar fashion: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: “If you are willing”</b> you will receive <b>good,</b> i.e., reward, <b>“but if you refuse”</b> you will receive <b>neither good nor bad.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, and one who rebels will receive punishment. |
| Isaiah 1:20 | “You shall be devoured by the sword” | Kiddushin 62a:1 | <b>“You shall be devoured by the sword”</b> (Isaiah 1:20)? <b>Rava says:</b> This verse should be interpreted as if it states: You shall devour the sword, i.e., you shall eat food that harms the body like a sword, e.g., <b>coarse grains [<i>gelalenita</i>] of salt, hard barley bread, and onions. As the Master said: Dried bakery [<i>purnei</i>] bread</b> eaten <b>with salt and onions harms the body like swords.</b> |
| Isaiah 1:21 | become a harlot?” | Megillah 31b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>On</b> the <b>Ninth of Av itself, what do we read as the <i>haftara</i>? Rav said:</b> The portion containing the verse <b>“How</b> did the faithful city <b>become a harlot?”</b> (Isaiah 1:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What Torah portion</b> do they read? <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>others say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse <b>“But if you will not hearken to me”</b> (Leviticus 26:14). <b>Rabbi Natan bar Yosef said:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long will this people provoke me?”</b> (Numbers 14:11). <b>And some say:</b> They read the portion containing the verse: <b>“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?”</b> (Numbers 14:27). The Gemara comments that <b>Abaye said: Nowadays, everyone is accustomed to read</b> the portion of <b>“When you shall beget children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:25–40), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“I will utterly consume them”</b> (Jeremiah 8:13–9:23). |
| Isaiah 1:21 | “She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers” | Sanhedrin 35a:6 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The verse states</b> prophetically concerning Jerusalem after the destruction of the First Temple: <b>“She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers”</b> (Isaiah 1:21). The verse associates lodging, or waiting overnight, with justice. <b>And Rava says</b> that these matters are derived <b>from here:</b> “Learn to do well; seek judgment, <b>relieve [<i>ashru</i>] the oppressed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17). This is interpreted: <b>Praise [<i>ashru</i>]</b> the <b>judge who delays [<i>meḥametz</i>] his verdict</b> before he pronounces it. |
| Isaiah 1:22 | say to him: “Your silver is become dross” | Bava Batra15b:10 | <b>And</b> further, with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that the generation of the judging of the Judges was one of vanity, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And it happened in the days of the judging of the Judges”</b> (Ruth 1:1)? This indicates <b>a generation that judged its judges.</b> If a judge would <b>say to</b> the defendant standing before him: <b>Remove the splinter from between your eyes,</b> meaning rid yourself of some minor infraction, the defendant would <b>say to him: Remove the beam from between your eyes,</b> meaning you have committed far more severe sins. If the judge would <b>say to him: “Your silver is become dross”</b> (Isaiah 1:22), meaning your coins are counterfeit, the defendant would <b>say to him: “Your wine is mixed with water”</b> (Isaiah 1:22), meaning you yourself dilute your wine with water and sell it. Since nobody behaved in proper manner, the judges were unable to judge. |
| Isaiah 1:25 | And once the exiles have been gathered, judgment will be meted out to the wicked, as it is stated: “And I will turn my hand against you and purge away your dross as with lye” | Megillah 17b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>the ingathering of</b> the <b>exiles after the blessing of the years? As it is written: “And you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they will soon be coming”</b> (Ezekiel 36:8), which indicates that the ingathering of the exiles will follow after Eretz Yisrael is blessed with bountiful produce. <b>And once the exiles have been gathered, judgment will be meted out to the wicked, as it is stated: “And I will turn my hand against you and purge away your dross as with lye”</b> (Isaiah 1:25), <b>and</b> immediately after <b>it is written: “And I will restore your judges as at first”</b> (Isaiah 1:26). For this reason the blessing of the restoration of judges comes after the blessing of the ingathering of the exiles. |
| Isaiah 1:26 | it is written: “And I will restore your judges as at first” | Megillah 17b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>the ingathering of</b> the <b>exiles after the blessing of the years? As it is written: “And you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they will soon be coming”</b> (Ezekiel 36:8), which indicates that the ingathering of the exiles will follow after Eretz Yisrael is blessed with bountiful produce. <b>And once the exiles have been gathered, judgment will be meted out to the wicked, as it is stated: “And I will turn my hand against you and purge away your dross as with lye”</b> (Isaiah 1:25), <b>and</b> immediately after <b>it is written: “And I will restore your judges as at first”</b> (Isaiah 1:26).

| Isaiah 1:27 | Ulla says: Jerusalem is redeemed only by means of righteousness, as it is stated: “Zion shall be redeemed with justice and those who return to it with righteousness” | Sanhedrin 98a:9 | <b>Ulla says: Jerusalem is redeemed only by means of righteousness, as it is stated: “Zion shall be redeemed with justice and those who return to it with righteousness”</b> (Isaiah 1:27). <b>Rav Pappa says: If the arrogant will cease</b> to exist, <b>the</b> Persian <b>sorcerers will cease</b> to exist as well. <b>If the</b> deceitful <b>judges</b> will <b>cease</b> to exist, <b>the royal officers [<i>gazirpatei</i>]</b> and taskmasters <b>will cease</b> to exist. Rav Pappa elaborates: <b>If the arrogant will cease, the</b> Persian <b>sorcerers will cease, as it is written: “And I will purge away your dross [<i>sigayikh</i>] as with lye, and I will remove all your alloy [<i>bedilayikh</i>].”</b> When the arrogant [<i>sigim</i>] are purged, the sorcerers, who are separated [<i>muvdalim</i>] from the fear of God, will also cease. <b>And if the</b> deceitful <b>judges cease</b> to exist, <b>the royal officers</b> and taskmasters <b>will cease</b> to exist, <b>as it is written: “The Lord has removed your judgments; cast out your enemy”</b> (Zephaniah 3:15). |

| Isaiah 1:28 | that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish” | Berakhot 8a:25 | The Gemara again returns to the topic of the synagogue. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the practical halakhic meaning of <b>that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish”</b> (Isaiah 1:28)? <b>This</b> verse <b>refers to one who abandons the Torah</b> scroll when it was taken out to be read <b>and leaves</b> the synagogue, as it appears that he is fleeing from God. |
| Isaiah 1:28 | shall cease to be” | Megillah 17b:17 | <b>And once judgment is meted out to the wicked, the transgressors,</b> i.e., the heretics and sectarians, <b>will cease to be.</b> Consequently, the next blessing is that of the heretics, <b>and one includes evildoers with them, as it is stated: “And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,</b> and they that forsake the Lord <b>shall cease to be”</b> (Isaiah 1:28). The “transgressors and sinners” are the evildoers, and “they that forsake the Lord” are the heretics. |
| Isaiah 1:31 | flax. Abaye said to him: Isn’t it written: “And the ḥason shall be as tow” | Shabbat 20b:7 | The mishna taught further that <b>one may not</b> light <b>with <i>ḥosen</i>. Rav Yosef said:</b> <i>Ḥosen</i> is <b>tow,</b> thin chaff that falls off the stalk <b>of</b> combed <b>flax. Abaye said to him: Isn’t it written: “And the <i>ḥason</i> shall be as tow”</b> (Isaiah 1:31)? <b>By inference, <i>ḥosen</i> is not tow.

| Isaiah 2:2 | “And all the nations shall flow [ venaharu ] unto it” | Bava Batra4a:3 | Herod <b>said to him: I am he. Had I known that the Sages were so cautious I would not have killed them.

Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: He</b> who <b>extinguished the light of the world</b> by killing the Torah Sages, <b>as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23), <b>should go and occupy himself with the light of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the Temple: <b>“And all the nations shall flow [<i>venaharu</i>] unto it”</b> (Isaiah 2:2), the word <i>venaharu</i> alluding to light [<i>nehora</i>]. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he said to him: He</b> who <b>blinded the eye of the world, as it is written</b> in reference to the Sages: <b>“And if</b> it be committed through ignorance <b>by the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Numbers 15:24), <b>should go and occupy himself with the eye of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written: “I will desecrate my Temple, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes”</b> (Ezekiel 24:21). |
| Isaiah 2:3 | “For Torah emerges from Zion” | Bava Batra21a:3 | When the Sages saw that not everyone was capable of teaching their children and Torah study was declining, <b>they instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that teachers of children should be established in Jerusalem.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret homiletically</b> that enabled them to do this? They interpreted the verse: <b>“For Torah emerges from Zion”</b> (Isaiah 2:3). <b>But still, whoever had a father,</b> his father <b>ascended with him</b> to Jerusalem <b>and had him taught, but whoever did not have a father, he did not ascend and learn.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> teachers of children <b>should be established</b> in one city <b>in each and every region [<i>pelekh</i>].

| Isaiah 2:3 | Because it is stated: “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem” | Berakhot 63b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the Sages of Eretz Yisrael go <b>to that extent</b> to stop Ḥanina? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is stated: “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 2:3). |
| Isaiah 2:3 | which is written: “And many peoples shall go and say: Go and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; | Pesachim 88a:3 | The Gemara returns to its discussion of prophecies of consolation that are related to those in the book of Hosea. <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And many peoples shall go and say: Go and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob;</b> and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths” (Isaiah 2:3)? The Gemara notes that Jacob is the only Patriarch mentioned and asks: Is <b>He the God of Jacob and not the God of Abraham and Isaac?</b> |
| Isaiah 2:4 | as it is written: “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not raise sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore” | Shabbat 63a:5 | <b>And the Rabbis say: They are nothing other than reprehensible</b> and in the future they will be eliminated, <b>as it is written: “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not raise sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore”</b> (Isaiah 2:4). |
| Isaiah 2:4 | as it is stated: “Nation will not raise sword against nation” | Shabbat 63a:9 | We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: These</b> weapons <b>are ornaments for him. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that elaborates on this subject: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: And since,</b> in your opinion, <b>they are ornaments for him, why are they</b> to be <b>eliminated in the messianic era? He said to them: They will not be needed</b> anymore, <b>as it is stated: “Nation will not raise sword against nation”</b> (Isaiah 2:4). The Gemara asks: <b>And let the weapons be merely for ornamental</b> purposes, even though they will not be needed for war. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>just as in</b> the case of <b>a candle in the afternoon.</b> Since its light is not needed, it serves no ornamental purpose. Weapons, too; when not needed for war, they serve no ornamental purpose either. |
| Isaiah 2:11 | destroyed, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day” | Rosh Hashanah31a:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with</b> regard to a statement <b>of Rav Ketina, as Rav Ketina said: The world will exist for six thousand years, and</b> for <b>one</b> thousand years it will be <b>destroyed, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), and one day for God is a thousand years, as indicated in the verse: “For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is past” (Psalms 90:4). Rav Ketina’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Conversely, <b>Abaye said:</b> The world will be <b>destroyed</b> for <b>two</b> thousand years, <b>as it is stated: “After two days He will revive us”</b> (Hosea 6:2). According to the opinion of Abaye that the destruction will be for two days, there is no connection between the future world and the day of Shabbat, which is only one day. |
| Isaiah 2:11 | those years when the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to renew His world, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day” | Sanhedrin 92b:1 | <b>And if you say:</b> During <b>those years when the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to renew His world, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), <b>what are the righteous</b> to <b>do?</b> How will they survive? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>make wings like eagles for them and</b> they will <b>fly over the surface of the water, as it is stated: “Therefore, we will not fear when God changes the land, and when the mountains are moved in the midst of the sea”</b> (Psalms 46:3). Although God will renew the land, they will not fear, because they will be in the sky over the sea at that time. <b>And lest you say</b> that they will endure <b>suffering</b> from flying uninterrupted for an extended period, <b>the verse states: “But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not tire”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). |
| Isaiah 2:11 | as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day” | Sanhedrin 97a:12 | § <b>Rav Ketina says: Six thousand years is</b> the duration of <b>the world,</b> and <b>it is in ruins</b> for <b>one</b> thousand years. The duration of the period during which the world is in ruins is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), and the day of God lasts one thousand years. <b>Abaye says: It is in ruins</b> for <b>two</b> thousand years, <b>as it is stated: “After two days He will revive us; in the third day He will revive us, and we shall live in His presence”</b> (Hosea 6:2). |
| Isaiah 2:14 | states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [ hanissaot ] hills” | Shevuot 6b:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The bright shade of <b>a <i>baheret</i></b> makes it appear <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding skin, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:25). This is <b>like the appearance of</b> an area illuminated by the <b>sun, which</b> appears <b>deeper than</b> the area in <b>the shade.</b> The darker shade of <b>a <i>se’et</i></b> makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word <b><i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than raised, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [<i>hanissaot</i>] hills”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). The words <i>hanissaot</i> and <i>se’et</i> share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>” (Leviticus 14:56), the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other than secondary, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he will say: Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>] please</b> to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36). This teaches that there is a leprous mark that is secondary and appended to a <i>se’et</i>. This is a mark that is the color of an egg membrane. |
| Isaiah 2:14 | elevated, as it is stated: “And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up [ nissaot ]” | Sotah 5b:1 | <b>“And for a sore [<i>se’et</i>] and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:56), <b>and <i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>elevated, as it is stated: “And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up [<i>nissaot</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). <b>And <i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>an appendage, as it is stated</b> in the context of the curse given to the descendants of Eli: <b>“Put me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>], I pray of you, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread”</b> (I Samuel 2:36). They will have to be joined with another priestly family to receive their priestly gifts. One can therefore interpret the verses discussing leprosy as teaching that one who initially is arrogant, <i>se’et</i>, will eventually become a <i>sappaḥat</i>, diminished in stature. |
| Isaiah 2:22 | as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little is he to be accounted” | Berakhot 14a:11 | <b>Rav said: Anyone who greets another</b> person in the morning <b>before he prayed, it is as if he built an altar</b> for idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little is he to be accounted”</b> (Isaiah 2:22). When one’s soul is breathed in through his nostrils in the morning (<i>ge’onim</i>) he should turn to no one other than God. <b>And do not read</b> it as it is written, <b><i>bameh</i>, how; but rather,</b> read <b><i>bama</i>, altar.</b> |
| Isaiah 2:22 | as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little [ bammeh ] is he to be accounted” | Sotah 4b:13 | <b>Ulla says:</b> Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he built</b> a personal <b>altar</b> for idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little [<i>bammeh</i>] is he to be accounted”</b> (Isaiah 2:22), referring to an arrogant person. <b>Do not read</b> the verse <b>as</b> it is written, <b><i>bammeh</i>,</b> how little. <b>Rather,</b> read it as <b><i>bama</i>,</b> altar. |
| Isaiah 3:3 | five characteristics: “The captain of fifty, and the man of favor, and the counselor, and the cunning charmer, and the skillful enchanter” | Chagigah 13a:6 | <b>Rabbi Ami said: The secrets of the Torah may be transmitted only to one who possesses</b> the following <b>five characteristics: “The captain of fifty, and the man of favor, and the counselor, and the cunning charmer, and the skillful enchanter”</b> (Isaiah 3:3). <b>And Rabbi Ami said</b> further: <b>The words of Torah may not be transmitted to a gentile, as it is stated: “He has not dealt so with any nation, and as for His ordinances, they have not known them”</b> (Psalms 147:20). |
| Isaiah 3:4 | “And I will make children their princes” | Chagigah 14a:13 | The Gemara continues to interpret this verse: <b>“And I will make children their princes”</b> (Isaiah 3:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“And I will make children [<i>ne’arim</i>] their princes”? Rabbi Elazar said: These are people who are devoid [<i>meno’arin</i>] of mitzvot;</b> such people will become the leaders of the nation. |
| Isaiah 3:5 | mind was not calmed until he said to them: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable” | Chagigah 14a:14 | <b>“And babes [<i>ta’alulim</i>] shall rule over them”; Rav Pappa bar Ya’akov said:</b> <i>Ta’alulim</i> means <b>foxes [<i>ta’alei</i>], sons of foxes.</b> In other words, inferior people both in terms of deeds and in terms of lineage. <b>And</b> the prophet Isaiah’s <b>mind was not calmed until he said to them: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable”</b> (Isaiah 3:5). “The child” [<i>na’ar</i>]; <b>these are people who are devoid of mitzvot,</b> who <b>will behave insolently toward one who is as filled with mitzvot as a pomegranate. “And the base [<i>nikleh</i>] against the honorable [<i>nikhbad</i>]”;</b> this means that <b>one for whom major [<i>kaved</i>]</b> transgressions <b>are like minor ones [<i>kalot</i>] in his mind will come and behave insolently with one for whom</b> even <b>minor</b> transgressions <b>are like major ones in his mind.</b> |
| Isaiah 3:5 | following verse: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable” | Chagigah 14a:7 | § The Gemara stated earlier that one who studies the secrets of Torah must be “a captain of fifty and a man of favor” (Isaiah 3:3), but it did not explain the meaning of these requirements. It now returns to analyze that verse in detail. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Israel to Babylonia, <b>he said: Isaiah cursed Israel with eighteen curses, and his mind was not calmed,</b> i.e., he was not satisfied, <b>until he said to them the</b> great curse of the <b>following verse: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable”</b> (Isaiah 3:5). |
| Isaiah 3:6 | You have a cloak, be our ruler” | Chagigah 14a:15 | § The Gemara continues its explanation of the chapter in Isaiah. <b>Rav Ketina said: Even at the time of Jerusalem’s downfall, trustworthy men did not cease to exist</b> among its people, <b>as it is stated: “For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,</b> and say: <b>You have a cloak, be our ruler”</b> (Isaiah 3:6). The Gemara explains that they would approach someone and say to him: <b>Things that people</b> are careful to keep <b>covered as with a cloak,</b> i.e., words of Torah that are covered and concealed, <b>are under your hand,</b> as you are an expert with regard to them. |
| Isaiah 3:6 | “And this stumbling block” | Chagigah 14a:16 | <b>What is</b> the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“And this stumbling block”</b> (Isaiah 3:6)? <b>Things that people cannot grasp unless they have stumbled over them,</b> as they can be understood only with much effort, <b>are under your hand. Although</b> they will approach an individual with these statements, he <b>“shall swear that day, saying: I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak; you shall not make me ruler of a people”</b> (Isaiah 3:7). When the verse states: <b>“Shall swear [<i>yissa</i>],” <i>yissa</i> is none</b> other <b>than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “You shall not take [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord your God</b> in vain” (Exodus 20:6). Therefore, the inhabitant of Jerusalem swears: <b>“I will not be a healer [<i>ḥovesh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 3:7), which means: <b>I was never</b> one <b>of those who sit [<i>meḥovshei</i>] in the study hall; “for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak,” as I possess</b> knowledge of <b>neither</b> the <b>Bible, nor Mishna, nor Gemara.</b> This shows that even at Jerusalem’s lowest spiritual ebb, its inhabitants would admit the truth and own up to their complete ignorance. |
| Isaiah 3:6 | “And let this stumbling-block be under your hand” | Gittin 43a:15 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna went back and placed an interpreter before him</b> so that he could tell the public that he had been wrong, <b>and he interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically.</b> The verse states: <b>“And let this stumbling-block be under your hand”</b> (Isaiah 3:6). <b>A person does not understand statements of Torah unless he stumbles in them.</b> Therefore, I retract my previous statement and say that <b>although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths half a woman, she is not betrothed, however,</b> if there was <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed,</b> then <b>her betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal. What is the reason</b> for the distinction? <b>There, he left</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition; here, he did not leave</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition.</b> |
| Isaiah 3:6 | Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ketina say: Even at the time of Jerusalem’s failure, trustworthy people did not cease there, as it is stated: “For a man will grab his brother of his father’s house and say: You have a garment. Come be a chief over us | Shabbat 119b:11 | <b>And Rava said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because there were no more trustworthy people there, as it is stated: “Roam about the streets of Jerusalem and see, and search its plazas, if you can find a person, who acts justly, who seeks integrity, that I should forgive it”</b> (Jeremiah 5:1). The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ketina say: Even at the time of Jerusalem’s failure, trustworthy people did not cease there, as it is stated: “For a man will grab his brother of his father’s house and say: You have a garment. Come be a chief over us</b> and let this ruin be under your care” (Isaiah 3:6)? <b>Things that people use to cover up like a garment,</b> secrets, <b>are in your hands</b> and you know about them. Therefore, you should be a leader of the community. And that which is stated: <b>“And let this ruin be under your care,”</b> meaning: |
| Isaiah 3:7 | “shall swear that day, saying: I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak; you shall not make me ruler of a people” | Chagigah 14a:16 | <b>What is</b> the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“And this stumbling block”</b> (Isaiah 3:6)? <b>Things that people cannot grasp unless they have stumbled over them,</b> as they can be understood only with much effort, <b>are under your hand. Although</b> they will approach an individual with these statements, he <b>“shall swear that day, saying: I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak; you shall not make me ruler of a people”</b> (Isaiah 3:7). When the verse states: <b>“Shall swear [<i>yissa</i>],” <i>yissa</i> is none</b> other <b>than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “You shall not take [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord your God</b> in vain” (Exodus 20:6). Therefore, the inhabitant of Jerusalem swears: <b>“I will not be a healer [<i>ḥovesh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 3:7), which means: <b>I was never</b> one <b>of those who sit [<i>meḥovshei</i>] in the study hall; “for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak,” as I possess</b> knowledge of <b>neither</b> the <b>Bible, nor Mishna, nor Gemara.</b> This shows that even at Jerusalem’s lowest spiritual ebb, its inhabitants would admit the truth and own up to their complete ignorance. |
| Isaiah 3:7 | “He will rise [ yissa ] on that day, saying, I will not be a ruler | Shabbat 120a:1 | <b>Matters</b> of Torah <b>that people do not ascertain unless they misunderstand them are in your hands;</b> therefore, <b>be a chief over us.</b> It is stated later on in that passage: <b>“He will rise [<i>yissa</i>] on that day, saying, I will not be a ruler</b> while in my house there is no bread and no garment, you shall not appoint me as chief of the people” (Isaiah 3:7). <b>The term rise [<i>yissa</i>] means nothing other than an oath, as it says: “Do not raise [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord</b> your God in vain” (Exodus 20:17). <b>I will not be a ruler,</b> means: <b>I will not be one of those who close themselves up in the study hall,</b> as I do not regularly do so, <b>while in my house there is no bread and no garment, for I have neither Bible nor Mishna nor Gemara in my hands.</b> According to this explanation, there were people of faith who truthfully admitted that they did not study Torah, even during the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. The Gemara rejects this: <b>And from what</b> do you conclude that this admission was due to their faithfulness? <b>Perhaps it is different</b> in that case, <b>as had he told them: I studied</b> Torah, <b>they would have said to him: Tell us</b> what you studied. As he would not know to respond, he would have no choice other than to admit that he did not study. The Gemara rejects this: That is not difficult, as <b>he could have</b> at least <b>said he learned and forgot.</b> The Gemara asks: Therefore, <b>what</b> is: <b>I will not be a ruler?</b> It means that he is telling the truth and although he could have lied, he admits that he did <b>not</b> study Torah <b>at all.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where it was taught that they were faithful, that was <b>with regard to matters of Torah;</b> whereas <b>here,</b> where it was taught that there were no more people of faith in Jerusalem, that was <b>with regard to</b> matters of <b>business.</b> |
| Isaiah 3:9 | “The recognition of their countenance does witness against them” | Bekhorot 46b:12 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof: If people saw <b>the forehead</b> of a dead person <b>without the countenance of the face,</b> or <b>the countenance of the face without the forehead, they cannot testify</b> that he died and render his wife permitted to remarry <b>until</b> they see <b>both</b> the countenance of the face and the forehead, <b>with the nose. And Abaye says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana</b> who says: <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“The recognition of their countenance does witness against them”</b> (Isaiah 3:9), and there is no recognition of a face without the nose. The Gemara answers: <b>Testimony</b> enabling <b>a woman</b> to remarry <b>is different, as the Sages were stringent with regard to it.</b> Therefore, they required greater proof than with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a firstborn. |
| Isaiah 3:9 | “The show of their face does witness against them” | Yevamot 120a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the witnesses saw his <b>forehead but not the countenance of the face,</b> or if they saw <b>the countenance of the face but not</b> his <b>forehead, they may not testify</b> that it is he, <b>until</b> they see <b>both of them with the nose. Abaye said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana</b> who said: <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that one may testify that a man died only if one sees his face? The verse is: <b>“The show of their face does witness against them”</b> (Isaiah 3:9), which indicates that one clearly recognizes another only upon seeing his face. |

For the righteous people in the future, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), <b>and “good” is referring to none</b> other than the <b>righteous, as it is stated: “Say</b> of <b>the righteous that it shall be good</b> for them, for they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). |
| Isaiah 3:10 | as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good, | Kiddushin 40a:10 | § With regard to the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i>, the Gemara states: An act of <b>merit has a principal</b> reward <b>and it has profits,</b> i.e., one receives additional reward beyond that which is granted for the mitzva itself, parallel to a principal sum and profits, <b>as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good,</b> that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). <b>A sin has a principal</b> penalty <b>but it has no profits,</b> i.e., no punishment beyond that, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one,</b> for the work of his hands shall be done to him” (Isaiah 3:11), but no more than the work of his hands. |
| Isaiah 3:10 | “Say you of the righteous who is good, that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” | Kiddushin 40a:8 | Rather, <b>Rava said: Rav Idi explained</b> the matter <b>to me.</b> The verse states: <b>“Say you of the righteous who is good, that they shall eat the fruit of their actions”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>And</b> this verse is difficult, as <b>is there a righteous person who is good and is there a righteous person who is not good? Rather,</b> this verse should be understood as follows: One who is <b>good</b> both <b>toward Heaven and toward people is a good righteous person;</b> one who is <b>good toward Heaven but bad toward people is a righteous person who is not good.</b> |
| Isaiah 3:10 | Good for the righteous, good for his neighbor, as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous that it shall be good for him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings” | Sukkah 56b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And due to</b> Miriam’s <b>father and mother, do we penalize an entire watch? Abaye said: Woe unto the wicked, woe unto his neighbor.</b> To conclude the tractate on a positive note, the Gemara says: <b>Good for the righteous, good for his neighbor, as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous that it shall be good for him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings”</b> (Isaiah 3:10); the neighbors of a righteous man who witness and acknowledge the good that befalls him will benefit from their proximity to him. |
| Isaiah 3:10 | and good means nothing other than righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous that he is good” | Yoma 38b:11 | Conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous, as it is written: “And the men of Sodom were</b> exceedingly <b>wicked and sinful to God”</b> (Genesis 13:13), after which it is written: <b>“And God said to Abram, after that Lot had separated from him”</b> (Genesis 13:14); God proceeds to bless him.

| Isaiah 3:11 | as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one, | Kiddushin 40a:10 | § With regard to the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i>, the Gemara states: An act of <b>merit has a principal</b> reward <b>and it has profits,</b> i.e., one receives additional reward beyond that which is granted for the mitzva itself, parallel to a principal sum and profits, <b>as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good,</b> that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). <b>A sin has a principal</b> penalty <b>but it has no profits,</b> i.e., no punishment beyond that, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one,</b> for the work of his hands shall be done to him” (Isaiah 3:11), but no more than the work of his hands. |

This does not apply to dispatching the mother bird, which is an act that does not benefit other people. |

| Isaiah 3:16 | that which is written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are haughty | Shabbat 62b:19 | Since the Gemara spoke of sins in the First Temple era, it continues to explain other verses with similar content. <b>Rava, son of Rav Ilai, interpreted</b> the following verse <b>homiletically. What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are haughty</b> and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet” (Isaiah 3:16)?<br>“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,” indicates <b>that they would walk with upright stature</b> and carry themselves in an immodest way.<br><b>“And walk with outstretched necks,”</b> indicates <b>that they would walk</b> in small steps, <b>heel to toe,</b> so onlookers would notice them.<br><b>“Wanton eyes,”</b> indicates <b>that they would fill their eyes with blue eye shadow and beckon.</b><br><b>“Walking and mincing [<i>tafof</i>] as they go,”</b> indicates <b>that the</b> wealthy women <b>would walk</b> a <b>tall</b> woman <b>alongside</b> a <b>short</b> one so that the tall woman would stand out. This is derived from the interchangeability of the letters <i>tet</i> and <i>tzadi</i>; <i>tzafo</i>, meaning, in this case, to be seen.<br><b>“Making a tinkling [<i>te’akasna</i>] with their feet,” Rabbi Yitzḥak from the school of Rabbi Ami said: This teaches that they would place myrrh and balsam in their shoes and would walk in the marketplaces of Jerusalem.

| Isaiah 3:16 | “stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes” | Sotah 47b:22 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> women with <b>“stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes”</b> (Isaiah 3:16) <b>proliferated, the bitter waters</b> of a <i>sota</i> <b>proliferated,</b> as more people were suspected of committing adultery; <b>but they</b> eventually <b>ceased</b> when licentiousness became too widespread. <b>From</b> the time <b>when those who accept gifts proliferated, the days decreased and the years shortened, as it is written: “And he who hates gifts lives”</b> (Proverbs 15:27). <b>From</b> the time <b>when those with boastful [<i>zeḥuḥei</i>] hearts proliferated, dispute proliferated in Israel.

| Isaiah 3:16 | forbidden sexual relations, it is written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet” | Yoma 9b:6 | With regard to <b>forbidden sexual relations, it is written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet”</b> (Isaiah 3:16). <br><b>Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,</b> indicates a <b>tall</b> woman walking <b>alongside</b> a <b>short</b> one so that the tall woman would stand out. <br><b>And walk with outstretched necks,</b> indicates <b>that they would walk with upright stature</b> and carry themselves in an immodest way. <br><b>And wanton eyes,</b> indicates <b>that they would fill their eyes with blue eye shadow</b> in order to draw attention to their eyes. <br><b>Walking and mincing as they go,</b> indicates <b>that they would walk</b> in small steps, <b>heel to toe,</b> so onlookers would notice them. <br><b>Making a tinkling [<i>te’akasna</i>] with their feet, Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> This teaches <b>that they would bring myrrh and balsam and place</b> them <b>in their shoes</b> and would walk in the marketplaces of Jerusalem. <b>And once they approached</b> a place where <b>young Jewish men</b> were congregated, <b>they would stamp</b> their feet on the ground <b>and splash</b> the perfume <b>toward them and instill the evil inclination into them like venom of a viper [<i>ke’eres bikhos</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 3:17 | “The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion | Shabbat 62b:21 | With regard to a different verse: <b>“The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion</b> and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts” (Isaiah 3:17). And the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion; <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: This teaches that there was an outbreak of leprosy among them.

| Isaiah 3:24 | As Rabba bar Ulla taught: “And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell, there shall be a stench; | Shabbat 62b:20 | <b>What was their punishment</b> for these sins? <b>As Rabba bar Ulla taught: “And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell, there shall be a stench;</b> and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a fine dress, a girding of sackcloth; instead of beauty, a brand” (Isaiah 3:24). <br>He explains: “And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there shall be a stench,” indicates that <b>the place that they would perfume became decaying sores.</b><br><b>“And instead of a sash, a rope [<i>nikpe</i>],”</b> indicates that <b>the place where they were girded with a sash became</b> covered with <b>many bruises</b> [<b><i>nekafim</i></b>].<br><b>“And instead of well-set hair, baldness,”</b> indicates that <b>the place where they would style</b> their hair <b>became bald</b> spots.<br><b>“And instead of a fine dress [<i>petigil</i>], a girding of sackcloth,”</b> indicates that the <b>orifices [<i>petaḥim</i>] that lead to pleasure [<i>gil</i>] will become</b> a place <b>for a girding of sackcloth.</b><br><b>“Instead of beauty, a brand [<i>ki</i>],” Rava said: That is</b> the popular expression <b>that people say: Instead of beauty, a sore [<i>kiva</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 3:26 | and clean she shall sit upon the ground” | Niddah 60b:4 | § The mishna teaches: In a case of <b>three</b> women <b>who wore</b> one garment, etc. If they sat on a stone bench or on the bench of a bathhouse, Rabbi Neḥemya deems all three women ritually pure, <b>as Rabbi Neḥemya would</b> say: Any item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is not susceptible to ritual impurity due to blood stains. The Gemara clarifies the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. <b>Rav Mattana says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya? As it is written:</b> “And her gates shall lament and mourn; <b>and clean she shall sit upon the ground”</b> (Isaiah 3:26). This teaches that <b>once she sits on the ground,</b> which is not susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>she shall be clean,</b> i.e., pure. |
| Isaiah 4:3 | Holy, recited before them, as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy” | Bava Batra75b:4 | With regard to <b>the righteous, this</b> is <b>as we</b> have just <b>said.</b> With regard to <b>the Messiah,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness”</b> (Jeremiah 23:6). With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there [<i>shamma</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 48:35). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b>“there” [<i>shamma</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: The Lord is <b>its name [<i>shemah</i>]. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will</b> have the name: <b>Holy, recited before them, as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy”</b> (Isaiah 4:3). |
| Isaiah 4:3 | The school of Eliyahu taught: The righteous whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to resurrect do not return to their dust, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who remains in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, anyone who is written unto life in Jerusalem” | Sanhedrin 92a:24 | <b>The school of Eliyahu taught: The righteous whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to resurrect do not return to their dust, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who remains in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, anyone who is written unto life in Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 4:3). <b>Just as</b> the <b>Holy One exists forever, so too will they exist forever.</b> |
| Isaiah 4:4 | And similarly it states: “When the Lord shall have washed [ raḥatz ] away the filth of the daughters of Zion, | Sotah 12b:2 | The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe [<i>lirḥotz</i>] in the river”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that she came down</b> to the river <b>to cleanse</b> herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>her father’s idols,</b> as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process. <b>And similarly it states: “When the Lord shall have washed [<i>raḥatz</i>] away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</b> and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction” (Isaiah 4:4). This washing clearly refers to the purging of spiritual sins, rather than bathing for the sake of cleanliness. |
| Isaiah 4:5 | as it is stated: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy” | Bava Batra75a:14 | § <b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will fashion seven canopies for each and every righteous</b> individual, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy”</b> (Isaiah 4:5). This <b>teaches that</b> for <b>each and every</b> righteous individual, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, fashions for him a canopy</b> seven times over, <b>in accordance with his honor,</b> i.e., greater individuals receive grander and larger canopies. |
| Isaiah 4:6 | “And there shall be a sukka for shade in the daytime from the heat, | Sukkah 2a:9 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states: <b>“And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat,</b> and for refuge and cover from storm and from rain” (Isaiah 4:6). In a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is sitting in the shade of the <i>sukka</i>,</b> i.e., the shade of the roofing; in a <i>sukka</i> that is <b>more than twenty cubits high, a person is not sitting in the shade of</b> the roofing of <b>the <i>sukka</i> but rather in the shade of the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i>, as their considerable height provides constant shade, rendering the shade of the roofing irrelevant. |
| Isaiah 4:6 | also did not say | Sukkah 2b:2 | Similarly, <b>they,</b> Rabba and Rava, <b>also did not say</b> that it is derived from the verse: “And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat” (Isaiah 4:6), <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> because in their opinion <b>it is</b> with regard <b>to the messianic era that this</b> verse <b>is written.</b> It means that God will be a shield and a shelter for the Jewish people; it is not referring to the structure of a <i>sukka</i>. |
| Isaiah 4:6 | from here: “And there shall be a sukka for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for refuge and cover from storm and from rain” | Sukkah 6b:15 | <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that the <b>rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> is derived <b>from here: “And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for refuge and cover from storm and from rain”</b> (Isaiah 4:6). A <i>sukka</i> without three full-fledged walls does not provide shelter nor serve as refuge. |
| Isaiah 5:1 | For Yadid , this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “Let me sing of my Beloved [ lididi ]” | Menachot 53b:1 | In the phrase: <b>Son of <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is Abraham, as it is written: “What has My beloved [<i>lididi</i>] to do in My house”</b> (Jeremiah 11:15). This verse is referring to Abraham, as will be explained. In the phrase: <b>And build <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is the Temple, as it is written: “How lovely [<i>yedidot</i>] are Your tabernacles”</b> (Psalms 84:2). And with regard to the term in the phrase: <b>For <i>Yadid</i>, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “Let me sing of my Beloved [<i>lididi</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 5:1). |
| Isaiah 5:2 | as it is written: “And he dug it [ vaye’azzekehu ] and cleared it of stones” | Rosh Hashanah23b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the correct reading of the mishna? Did <b>we learn: Beit Ya’zek, or</b> did <b>we learn: Beit Yazek?</b> The Gemara explains the difference between these two versions. <b>Did we learn: Beit Ya’zek,</b> which is <b>an lofty term,</b> indicating that it was a fine place where the witnesses had a pleasant experience, <b>as it is written: “And he dug it [<i>vaye’azzekehu</i>] and cleared it of stones”</b> (Isaiah 5:2), which shows that the root <i>a-z-k</i> denotes improvement? <b>Or perhaps we learned: Beit Yazek,</b> which <b>is a term of distress,</b> reflecting the fact that the witnesses who arrived there on Shabbat were not permitted to move from there all day, <b>as it is written: “And he was bound with chains [<i>bazikim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 40:1). |
| Isaiah 5:9 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant” | Berakhot 58b:4 | Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: You have nothing about which to sigh, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant”</b> (Isaiah 5:9). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore them to their</b> original locations and their <b>inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion,</b> which cannot be moved but abides forever” (Psalms 125:1). From this verse one may infer that <b>just as in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to its inhabited state, so too, in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the houses of the righteous to their inhabited state,</b> so you have no reason to sigh. <b>Seeing that he was still not satisfied,</b> Ulla <b>said to him: It is enough for a servant to be like his master.</b> Since God leaves His home, the Holy Temple, in ruins, one should not be distraught over the destruction of the houses of the righteous. |
| Isaiah 5:11 | omitted recitation of Shema morning and evening, as it is stated: “Woe to those who rise early in the morning and pursue the drink | Shabbat 119b:7 | The Gemara suggests additional reasons for the destruction of Jerusalem. <br><b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because</b> its citizens intentionally <b>omitted recitation of <i>Shema</i> morning and evening, as it is stated: “Woe to those who rise early in the morning and pursue the drink</b> and are aflame from wine until late in the evening” (Isaiah 5:11). <b>And it is written</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And their drinking parties have lyre and lute, drum and flute and wine, and they do not look upon the actions of God,</b> and they do not see His hands’ creations” (Isaiah 5:12). This means that in the morning and evening, when the Jews should have been reciting <i>Shema</i>, they were drinking wine and liquor. <b>And it is written</b> in that passage: <b>“Therefore My nation is being exiled for its ignorance;</b> its honor will die of hunger and its multitudes will be parched with thirst” (Isaiah 5:13). |

As it was stated: “And you shall guard and perform, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:6). <b>What wisdom and understanding</b> is there in the Torah <b>that is in the eyes of the nations,</b> i.e., appreciated and recognized by all? <b>You must say: This is the calculation of astronomical seasons and</b> the movement of <b>constellations,</b> as the calculation of experts is witnessed by all. |

| Isaiah 5:13 | What is written afterward? “Therefore, My people have gone into captivity, for want of knowledge” | Sotah 48a:21 | After listing the sin of those who drink wine with musical accompaniment, the verse states their punishment: <b>What is written afterward? “Therefore, My people have gone into captivity, for want of knowledge”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), meaning <b>that they cause exile to the world; “and their honorable men are famished”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>as they bring famine to the world; “and their multitude are parched with thirst”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>that they cause the Torah,</b> which is compared to water, <b>to be forgotten by those who learn it. “And mankind is bowed down, and man is humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> i.e., God Himself, <b>to be brought down, as “man”</b> in the phrase “and man is humbled” means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as</b> it <b>is stated: “The Lord is a man of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). The verse continues: <b>“And the eyes of the lofty are humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the Jewish people to be brought down.</b> These are the five retributions. |
| Isaiah 5:14 | “Therefore, the netherworld has enlarged itself and opened its mouth without measure [ livli ḥok ]” | Sanhedrin 111a:2 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“Therefore, the netherworld has enlarged itself and opened its mouth without measure [<i>livli ḥok</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 5:14), <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to <b>one who leaves even one statute [<i>ḥok</i>]</b> unfulfilled; the netherworld expands for him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is not satisfactory to</b> God, <b>their Master, that you said this about them,</b> as according to Reish Lakish’s opinion most of the Jewish people would be doomed to Gehenna. <b>Rather, even if one learned only one statute,</b> he has a share in the World-to-Come, and “<i>livli ḥok</i>” means one who has learned no statutes at all. |
| Isaiah 5:14 | the netherworld has enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure, and down goes their glory and their tumult and their uproar, and he who rejoices among them” | Sotah 48b:1 | <b>the netherworld has enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure, and down goes their glory and their tumult and their uproar, and he who rejoices among them”</b> (Isaiah 5:14). Their punishment is that they shall descend into the netherworld. |
| Isaiah 5:15 | to be forgotten by those who learn it. “And mankind is bowed down, and man is humbled” | Sotah 48a:21 | After listing the sin of those who drink wine with musical accompaniment, the verse states their punishment: <b>What is written afterward? “Therefore, My people have gone into captivity, for want of knowledge”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), meaning <b>that they cause exile to the world; “and their honorable men are famished”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>as they bring famine to the world; “and their multitude are parched with thirst”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>that they cause the Torah,</b> which is compared to water, <b>to be forgotten by those who learn it. “And mankind is bowed down, and man is humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> i.e., God Himself, <b>to be brought down, as “man”</b> in the phrase “and man is humbled” means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as</b> it <b>is stated: “The Lord is a man of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). The verse continues: <b>“And the eyes of the lofty are humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the Jewish people to be brought down.</b> These are the five retributions. |
| Isaiah 5:16 | as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice, and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness” | Berakhot 12b:3 | In contrast, <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that one need not be exacting, and <b>even</b> if <b>he said: The holy God</b> during those ten days, he fulfilled his obligation, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice, and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness”</b> (Isaiah 5:16). The Gemara explains: <b>When</b> is it appropriate to describe God with terms like: <b>And the Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice?</b> It is appropriate when God reveals Himself through justice, <b>during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur,</b> yet the verse <b>says: The holy God.</b> This appellation sufficiently underscores God’s transcendence, and there is no need to change the standard formula. |
| Isaiah 5:17 | and the ruins of the fat ones [ meḥim ] shall wanderers eat” | Pesachim 68a:10 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: What is Ḥiyya bar Rav’s reason</b> for explaining the term in this manner? <b>As it is written:</b> “Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, <b>and the ruins of the fat ones [<i>meḥim</i>] shall wanderers eat”</b> (Isaiah 5:17). <b>From where may it be inferred</b> that this verse is in any way connected to our discussion? <b>As Rav Yosef translates</b> this verse: <b>“And the righteous shall inherit the possessions of the wicked.”</b> This indicates that the word <i>meḥim</i>, understood by Rav Yosef as referring to the wicked, is a term of degradation. This led Ḥiyya bar Rav to interpret the mishna’s clause with regard to cleaning [<i>miḥui</i>] the intestines as referring to removing the repulsive matter inside. |
| Isaiah 5:18 | “Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity” | Berakhot 24b:20 | <b>Rav Asi said</b> that this is derived from the verse: <b>“Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity”</b> (Isaiah 5:18), meaning that this man brings sin upon himself for naught. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> it is derived <b>from here: “For he has shown contempt for the word of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:31), meaning that uttering God’s word in a place of filth shows contempt for the Lord. |
| Isaiah 5:18 | “Woe unto them who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with a cart rope” | Sanhedrin 99b:6 | <b>And about</b> Manasseh ben Hezekiah <b>it is stated explicitly in the</b> texts of <b>tradition,</b> the Prophets: <b>“Woe unto them who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with a cart rope”</b> (Isaiah 5:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“as with a cart rope”? Rabbi Asi says:</b> This is a reference to <b>the evil inclination. Initially, it seems like</b> a flimsy <b>spinning [<i>kuveya</i>] thread and ultimately it seems like</b> a sturdy <b>cart rope.</b> |
| Isaiah 5:18 | ropes of a wagon, as it is stated: “Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as if it were with a wagon rope” | Sukkah 52a:5 | Apropos the evil inclination and the battle against it, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Asi said: Initially,</b> when it begins to entice someone, <b>the evil inclination is like a strand of a spider’s web [<i>bukhya</i>]; and ultimately it is like</b> the thick <b>ropes of a wagon, as it is stated: “Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as if it were with a wagon rope”</b> (Isaiah 5:18). Initially, the enticement is almost imperceptible, like a thin strand; however, after one sins, it is like wagon ropes tied tightly around him. |
| Isaiah 5:20 | And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil” | Sotah 41b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil”</b> (Isaiah 5:20). <b>What is written afterward? “Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours straw, and as the chaff is consumed by the flame”</b> (Isaiah 5:24), meaning that the people described in the earlier verse will end up burning like straw in the fires of Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 5:20 | proliferated, “Those who say to evil good, and to good evil” | Sotah 47b:18 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when those who whisper whisperings in judgment,</b> advising judges surreptitiously, <b>proliferated, fierce anger proliferated in Israel, and the Divine Presence departed, because it is stated:</b> “God stands in the congregation of God; <b>in the midst of the judges He judges”</b> (Psalms 82:1). The Divine Presence that dwells among judges leaves if they judge improperly. <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> those who are referred to in the verse: <b>“Their heart goes after their covetousness”</b> (Ezekiel 33:31), <b>proliferated, “Those who say to evil good, and to good evil”</b> (Isaiah 5:20) <b>proliferated,</b> i.e., those who treat wicked people as though they were righteous proliferated as a result. <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> the fulfillment of the verse: <b>“Those who say to evil good, and to good evil,” proliferated,</b> the cry of: <b>Woe, woe, proliferated in the world.</b> There was an increase in troubles that cause people to cry out. |
| Isaiah 5:24 | What is written afterward? “Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours straw, and as the chaff is consumed by the flame” | Sotah 41b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil”</b> (Isaiah 5:20). <b>What is written afterward? “Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours straw, and as the chaff is consumed by the flame”</b> (Isaiah 5:24), meaning that the people described in the earlier verse will end up burning like straw in the fires of Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 6:1 | you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne” | Yevamot 49b:7 | The Gemara expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said:</b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him.</b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said:</b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6). |
| Isaiah 6:2 | One verse states: “Each one had six wings; | Chagigah 13b:8 | The Gemara asks another question: <b>One verse states: “Each one had six wings;</b> with two it covered its face and with two it covered its feet, and with two it flew” (Isaiah 6:2), <b>and another verse states: “And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings”</b> (Ezekiel 1:6). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> when the verse states they each had six wings, it is referring <b>to the time when the Temple is standing,</b> while <b>there,</b> where four wings are described, it is referring <b>to the time when the Temple is not standing,</b> for <b>it is as if</b> the number of <b>the wings of the animals were diminished</b> so that they now have only four. |
| Isaiah 6:3 | it is written: “The entire world is full of His glory” | Berakhot 43b:20 | <b>And he may not walk with an upright posture,</b> but slightly bowed, <b>as the Master said: One who walks with an upright posture</b> and in an arrogant manner, <b>even four cubits,</b> it is <b>as if he is pushing away the feet of the Divine Presence,</b> as <b>it is written: “The entire world is full of His glory”</b> (Isaiah 6:3). One who walks in an arrogant way shows a lack of regard for the glory and honor of God that is surrounding him, and thereby chases God from that place. |
| Isaiah 6:3 | one says: “Holy is the Lord of hosts; | Chullin 91b:14 | The Gemara comments: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥananel</b> when he related what <b>Rav said. As Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Three groups of ministering angels recite a song every day</b> from the verse “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord”; <b>one says: “Holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy is the Lord of hosts;</b> the whole earth is full of His glory” (Isaiah 6:3). |
| Isaiah 6:3 | “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; | Chullin 91b:16 | <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the Jewish people mention the name</b> of God <b>after two words, as it is stated: “Hear, Israel: The Lord</b> our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>But the ministering angels mention the name</b> of God <b>only after three words, as it is written:</b> “And one called unto another, and said: <b>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;</b> the whole earth is full of His glory” (Isaiah 6:3). |
| Isaiah 6:3 | as it is stated: “The entire world is full of His glory” | Kiddushin 31a:3 | With regard to the same issue, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> It is <b>prohibited for a person to walk</b> even <b>four cubits with an upright posture,</b> which is considered an arrogant manner, <b>as it is stated: “The entire world is full of His glory”</b> (Isaiah 6:3). One who walks in an arrogant manner indicates a lack of regard for the glory and honor of God that is surrounding him, and thereby chases God from that place, as it were. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, would not walk four cubits with an uncovered head. He said: The Divine Presence is above my head,</b> and I must act respectfully. |
| Isaiah 6:3 | song, | Megillah 10b:26 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>The ministering angels wanted to sing</b> their <b>song,</b> for the angels would sing songs to each other, as it states: “And they called out to each other and said” (Isaiah 6:3), but <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The work of My hands,</b> the Egyptians, are <b>drowning at sea, and you</b> wish to <b>say songs?</b> This indicates that God does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked. |
| Isaiah 6:4 | House was filled with smoke, as it is stated: “And the House was filled with smoke” | Yoma 53a:11 | <b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: Your interpretation indicates that the leaf of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its root, as the requirement for a root is merely considered an addition. <b>But wasn’t the opposite taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He put into</b> the incense <b>a root of a smoke-raiser,</b> and the smoke <b>would rise in a column like a staff until it reached</b> the Temple <b>ceiling. When it reached</b> the <b>ceiling</b> there was nowhere for the smoke to exit the building, and therefore it slowly <b>descended the walls until the</b> entire <b>House was filled with smoke, as it is stated: “And the House was filled with smoke”</b> (Isaiah 6:4). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the root of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its leaf. |
| Isaiah 6:5 | due to that which he said: “In the midst of a people of unclean lips, I dwell” | Yevamot 49b:8 | <b>Isaiah said</b> to himself: <b>I know him,</b> i.e., Manasseh, <b>that he will not accept whatever</b> explanation <b>that I will say to him</b> to resolve my prophecies with the words of the Torah. <b>And</b> even <b>if I say it to him, I will make him into an intentional transgressor</b> since he will kill me anyway. Therefore, in order to escape, <b>he uttered a</b> divine <b>name</b> and <b>was swallowed within a cedar</b> tree. Manasseh’s servants <b>brought the cedar</b> tree <b>and sawed through it</b> in order to kill him. <b>When</b> the saw <b>reached to where his mouth was,</b> Isaiah <b>died.</b> He died specifically at this point <b>due to that which he said: “In the midst of a people of unclean lips, I dwell”</b> (Isaiah 6:5). He was punished for referring to the Jewish people in a derogatory manner. |
| Isaiah 6:6 | Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me” | Berakhot 4b:23 | After this discussion of the statement that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Avina said, another statement of Rabbi Elazar is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: What was said about</b> the angel <b>Michael is greater than what was said about</b> the angel <b>Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while <b>regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,</b> approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [<i>muaf biaf]</i>,” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights. |
| Isaiah 6:6 | one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me” | Berakhot 4b:25 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), <b>and there, it is written: “And behold, Michael, one of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid”</b> (Daniel 10:13). Since the verse from Daniel refers to Michael as “one,” which aggadic midrash interprets as “the unique one,” so, too, “one of the seraphs” described in Isaiah must also refer to the unique one, Michael. |
| Isaiah 6:7 | his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [ vesar avonekh ], and your sin expiated” | Berakhot 57a:5 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat”</b> (Psalms 147:14). And <b>one who sees barley [<i>se’orim</i>] in a dream</b> has received a sign that <b>his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [<i>vesar avonekh</i>], and your sin expiated”</b> (Isaiah 6:7); <i>se’orim</i> is an acronym for <i>sar avon</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: I did not ascend from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael until I saw barley in my dream.</b> |
| Isaiah 6:7 | place their hands on his head and say to him: “And your iniquity has passed, and your sin has been atoned” | Shabbat 119b:3 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said: One who prays on Shabbat evening and recites <i>vaykhullu</i>, the two ministering angels who accompany the person</b> at all times <b>place their hands on his head and say to him: “And your iniquity has passed, and your sin has been atoned”</b> (Isaiah 6:7). <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Two ministering angels accompany a person on Shabbat evening from the synagogue to his home, one good</b> angel <b>and one evil</b> angel. <b>And when</b> he <b>reaches his home and finds a lamp burning and a table set and his bed made, the good angel says: May it be</b> Your <b>will that it shall be like this for another Shabbat. And the evil angel answers against his will: Amen. And if</b> the person’s home is <b>not</b> prepared for Shabbat in that manner, <b>the evil angel says: May it be</b> Your <b>will that it shall be so for another Shabbat, and the good angel answers against his will: Amen.</b> |
| Isaiah 6:10 | forgiveness? But isn’t it written: “Repent, and be healed” | Megillah 17b:12 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>But what did you see to rely on this</b> verse? <b>Rely on the other</b> verse, which juxtaposes repentance to healing. The Gemara answers: <b>Another verse,</b> in which it is <b>written: “Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who redeems your life from the pit”</b> (Psalms 103:3–4), proves that the theme of healing should follow that of forgiveness. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that</b> verse coming <b>to say that</b> the blessings of <b>redemption and healing</b> should be placed following the blessing of <b>forgiveness? But isn’t it written: “Repent, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10), which suggests that repentance should be followed by healing? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring <b>not</b> to <b>the</b> literal <b>healing from illness, but rather</b> to <b>the</b> figurative <b>healing of forgiveness,</b> and therefore this verse too supports the sequence of forgiveness following repentance. |
| Isaiah 6:10 | against a person, as it is stated: “Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and they will return, and be healed” | Rosh Hashanah17b:8 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, for it tears up the sentence</b> issued <b>against a person, as it is stated: “Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and they will return, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10), implying that if indeed they return and repent, they will be healed from all their sins. |
| Isaiah 6:10 | and be healed” | Rosh Hashanah17b:9 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But perhaps</b> this was said <b>before the sentence</b> was issued, but after one’s sentence has been decreed repentance no longer helps. Abaye <b>said to him: It is written</b> here: “And they will return <b>and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10). <b>What requires healing?</b> An illness does. Consequently, <b>you must say</b> that the reference here is to <b>a sentence</b> that has already been issued, and even so, after repentance, they will be healed. |
| Isaiah 6:13 | as it is stated: “And if there be a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up” | Ketubot 112b:2 | The Gemara continues to discuss the messianic age. <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said:</b> In <b>the generation in which the son of David</b> will <b>come</b> there will be <b>indictments [<i>kateigorya</i>],</b> i.e., denouncements and incitements <b>against Torah scholars. When I said this before Shmuel he said:</b> The generation will undergo <b>refinement after refinement,</b> i.e., several stages of cleansing, <b>as it is stated: “And if there be a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up”</b> (Isaiah 6:13). <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> about the messianic era: <b>Despoilers and despoilers of despoilers</b> will plunder Eretz Yisrael at that time. |
| Isaiah 7:1 | “And it came to pass in the days of [ vayhi bimei ] Ahasuerus”; “And it came to pass in the days [ vayhi bimei ] when the judges ruled”; “And it came to pass in the days of [ vayhi bimei ] Amraphel”; “And it came to pass in the days of [ vayhi bimei ] Ahaz” | Megillah 10b:12 | The Gemara states that <b>there are five</b> instances of <b><i>vayhi bimei</i></b> in the Bible. <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahasuerus”; “And it came to pass in the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges ruled”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amraphel”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahaz”</b> (Isaiah 7:1); <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Jehoiakim”</b> (Jeremiah 1:3). In all those incidents, grief ensued. |
| Isaiah 7:3 | as it is stated: “And the Lord said to Isaiah: Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool in the highway of the launderer’s [ koves ] field” | Sanhedrin 104a:6 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>not enumerate Ahaz</b> among the kings with no share in the World-to-Come? His wickedness is extensively recounted in the Bible. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> He is not enumerated <b>because he is cast between two righteous</b> people, <b>between</b> his father, <b>Jotham, and</b> his son, <b>Hezekiah. Rav Yosef says:</b> He is not enumerated <b>because he had</b> a sense of <b>embarrassment from Isaiah</b> the prophet, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord said to Isaiah: Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool in the highway of the launderer’s [<i>koves</i>] field”</b> (Isaiah 7:3). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>koves</i>? There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> It means concealed [<i>kavash</i>], <b>as</b> Ahaz <b>concealed [<i>dekhavshinhu</i>] his face and passed by</b> the prophet because he was embarrassed to be seen. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: He placed a launderer’s vessel over his head and passed by</b> the prophet so that Isaiah would be unable to identify him. |
| Isaiah 7:19 | as it is written: “And upon all thorns, and upon all brambles” | Megillah 10b:20 | <b>“Instead of the thorn”;</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Haman.</b> He is referred to as a thorn <b>because he turned himself into an object of idol worship,</b> as he decreed that all must prostrate themselves before him. The Gemara cites proof that the term thorn is used in connection with idol worship, <b>as it is written: “And upon all thorns, and upon all brambles”</b> (Isaiah 7:19), which is understood to be a reference to idol worship. |
| Isaiah 7:20 | as it is written: “On that day shall the Lord shave with a hired razor in the parts beyond the river the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the legs, and it shall also sweep away the beard” | Sanhedrin 95b:15 | § <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Were the</b> following <b>verse not written, it</b> would have been <b>impossible to say it,</b> since it appears to be a desecration of the name of God, <b>as it is written: “On that day shall the Lord shave with a hired razor in the parts beyond the river the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the legs, and it shall also sweep away the beard”</b> (Isaiah 7:20). The blasphemous indication is that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will Himself shave Sennacherib. |
| Isaiah 7:20 | which is written: “And it shall also destroy the beard” | Sanhedrin 96a:2 | Sennacherib <b>said to them: Give me scissors.</b> The ministering angels <b>said to him: Grind a <i>se’a</i> of pits and we will give</b> it <b>to you. He ground a <i>se’a</i> of pits and they gave him scissors. By</b> the time <b>he came</b> back with the scissors <b>it grew dark.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to</b> Sennacherib: <b>Go</b> and <b>bring fire</b> to provide light. Sennacherib <b>went and brought fire. While he was fanning it, the fire ignited his beard</b> and <b>it spread</b> and <b>sheared his head and his beard.</b> The Sages <b>said: This is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And it shall also destroy the beard”</b> (Isaiah 7:20). <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: If you scorch a gentile</b> and <b>it is pleasant for him, ignite a fire in his beard and you will never tire of ridiculing him.</b> It means that if one does not protest when others ridicule him, they will escalate the ridicule. The adage is based upon this incident involving Sennacherib. |
| Isaiah 7:21 | two sheep, as it is stated: “That a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep [ tzon ]” | Chullin 135a:3 | <b>And how many are numerous? Beit Shammai say:</b> It is at least <b>two sheep, as it is stated: “That a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 7:21), indicating that two sheep are characterized as <i>tzon</i>; and the mitzva of the first sheared wool is written using the term “your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>].” <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is at least <b>five</b> sheep, <b>as it is stated: “And five sheep [<i>tzon</i>] made”</b> (I Samuel 25:18). |
| Isaiah 7:21 | also called tzon , | Chullin 137a:17 | § The mishna states: <b>And how many is numerous?</b> Beit Shammai say: It is at least two sheep, and Beit Hillel say: It is at least five sheep. The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, two</b> sheep are <b>also called <i>tzon</i>,</b> as in the verse cited by Beit Shammai: “That a man shall rear a young cow and two sheep [<i>tzon</i>]” (Isaiah 7:21). Since the mitzva of the first sheared wool is written with regard to <i>tzon</i>, it is logical that it applies to two sheep. <b>But what is the reasoning of Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that the mitzva applies only to five sheep, due to the verse: “And five sheep [<i>tzon</i>] made” (I Samuel 25:18)? Why do they not apply the obligation using the broader criterion of two sheep, as the verse quoted by Beit Shammai clearly indicates that two sheep are also called <i>tzon</i>? |
| Isaiah 7:23 | says: “And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were one thousand vines for one thousand silver coins, it shall be for briars and thorns” | Sanhedrin 94b:15 | <b>And</b> it is <b>about that generation</b> that the prophet <b>says: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young calf and two sheep.</b> And it shall come to pass, from the abundance of milk that they produce, he shall eat butter, for butter and honey shall everyone eat, everyone who remains in the midst of the land” (Isaiah 7:21–22). <b>And</b> the prophet continues and <b>says: “And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were one thousand vines for one thousand silver coins, it shall be for briars and thorns”</b> (Isaiah 7:23). <b>Although one thousand vines are worth one thousand silver coins</b> and one could earn substantial profits through agricultural labor, the fields <b>will</b> grow <b>briars and thorns</b> due to neglect. The people of that generation were devoted to the study of Torah and engaged in labor only minimally to sustain themselves. |
| Isaiah 8:2 | “And I will take to Me faithful witnesses to attest: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah” | Makkot 24b:3 | Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: That is why I am laughing, as it is written,</b> when God revealed the future to the prophet Isaiah: <b>“And I will take to Me faithful witnesses to attest: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah”</b> (Isaiah 8:2). <b>Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah?</b> He clarifies the difficulty: <b>Uriah</b> prophesied <b>during the First Temple</b> period, <b>and Zechariah</b> prophesied <b>during the Second Temple</b> period, as he was among those who returned to Zion from Babylonia. <b>Rather, the verse established that</b> fulfillment of <b>the prophecy of Zechariah</b> is <b>dependent on</b> fulfillment of <b>the prophecy of Uriah.</b> |
| Isaiah 8:7 | “Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the strong and abundant waters of the river, the king of Assyria” | Sanhedrin 94b:7 | It is written in the verse: <b>“Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the strong and abundant waters of the river, the king of Assyria”</b> (Isaiah 8:7). <b>And it is written: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall inundate and pass through, reaching even the neck”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). Rab-shakeh alluded to that prophecy when he said in the verse in Kings that the Lord said to destroy the land. |
| Isaiah 8:8 | And it is written: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall inundate and pass through, reaching even the neck” | Sanhedrin 94b:7 | It is written in the verse: <b>“Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the strong and abundant waters of the river, the king of Assyria”</b> (Isaiah 8:7). <b>And it is written: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall inundate and pass through, reaching even the neck”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). Rab-shakeh alluded to that prophecy when he said in the verse in Kings that the Lord said to destroy the land. |
| Isaiah 8:8 | as it is stated: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall overflow and pass” | Sanhedrin 95b:7 | It was <b>taught: The first</b> set of soldiers in the army of Sennacherib <b>crossed by swimming</b> across the Jordan, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall overflow and pass”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). Since the water level diminished with their crossing, <b>the middle</b> group of soldiers <b>passed while standing upright, as it is stated: “It shall reach even the neck”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). <b>The last</b> soldiers already <b>kicked up dust with their feet, and they did not find water in the river to drink,</b> and they had no water <b>until they brought water from another place and drank</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “I dug and drank water”</b> (Isaiah 37:25). |
| Isaiah 8:12 | came and said to him: “Say not: A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people say: A conspiracy” | Sanhedrin 26a:23 | <b>Hezekiah was afraid. He said: Perhaps, God forbid, the opinion of the Holy One, Blessed be He, will follow the majority;</b> and <b>since the majority have submitted</b> to the Assyrians, even <b>those</b> who have not submitted <b>will also be submitted</b> into their hands. <b>The prophet</b> Isaiah then <b>came and said to him: “Say not: A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people say: A conspiracy”</b> (Isaiah 8:12). <b>Meaning, it is a conspiracy of wicked people, and a conspiracy of wicked people is not counted.</b> Therefore, although they are many, they are not considered the majority. |
| Isaiah 8:14 | “And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel” | Sanhedrin 38a:2 | Having mentioned the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya, the Gemara relates: <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya, were sitting at a meal before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and they were not saying anything.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> his servants: <b>Add more wine for the young men, so that they will say something. Once they were inebriated, they loosened</b> their tongues <b>and said: The son of David,</b> i.e., the Messiah, <b>will not come until two fathers’ houses are destroyed from Israel,</b> as those two families are preventing the redemption. <b>And they are the head of the exile who is in Babylonia,</b> i.e., the family of the Exilarch, <b>and the <i>Nasi</i> who is in Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., the family of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (see 5a), <b>as it is stated</b> in reference to the Messiah: <b>“And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel”</b> (Isaiah 8:14). |
| Isaiah 8:16 | as it is stated: “Bind up the testimony, seal the Torah among my disciples” | Sanhedrin 103b:10 | <b>Ahaz nullified the</b> Temple <b>service and sealed the Torah,</b> prohibiting its study, <b>as it is stated: “Bind up the testimony, seal the Torah among my disciples”</b> (Isaiah 8:16). <b>Manasseh excised the mentions</b> of God’s names from sacred books <b>and destroyed the altar. Amon burned the Torah and sacrificed a gecko,</b> an impure creeping animal, <b>upon the altar. Ahaz permitted</b> engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>forbidden relatives,</b> and announced that marriage between those relatives is permitted. <b>Manasseh</b> exploited that pronouncement and <b>engaged in sexual intercourse with his sister.</b> |
| Isaiah 8:17 | “And I will wait upon [ veḥikkiti ] the Lord” | Megillah 24b:11 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>If you were a Levite, you would be disqualified from</b> singing on <b>the platform</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>because your voice is thick.</b> Offended by this remark, Rabbi Shimon <b>went and told his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what Rabbi Ḥiyya had said. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>say to him: When you</b> study and <b>reach</b> the verse: <b>“And I will wait upon [<i>veḥikkiti</i>] the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 8:17), <b>will you not be a maligner and a blasphemer?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who was from Babylonia, was unable to differentiate between the letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i>, and he would therefore pronounce the word <i>veḥikkiti</i> as <i>vehikkiti</i>, which means: And I will strike. |
| Isaiah 8:19 | which is written: “And when they shall say to you: Seek unto the necromancers and the diviners, that chirp [ metzaftzefim ] and that mutter [ mahggim ]” | Sotah 12b:12 | The Gemara explains: <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when they shall say to you: Seek unto the necromancers and the diviners, that chirp [<i>metzaftzefim</i>] and that mutter [<i>mahggim</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 8:19)? The explanation of their chirping and muttering is: <b>They see [<i>tzofin</i>], but they do not know what they are seeing; they enunciate [<i>mahggim</i>], but they do not know what they are enunciating.</b> Although necromancers and diviners do have some insight into the future, they do not see clearly enough to understand what they are actually seeing. |
| Isaiah 8:21 | as the verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, when he shall be hungry, he shall fret, and curse his king and his god, and turn his face upward” | Avodah Zarah53a:6 | <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, when he shall be hungry, he shall fret, and curse his king and his god, and turn his face upward”</b> (Isaiah 8:21). <b>And it is written after</b> this verse: <b>“And he shall look to the earth, and behold distress and darkness,</b> the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness” (Isaiah 8:22). This indicates <b>that even though he cursed his king and his</b> idolatrous <b>god, and</b> he <b>turned his face upward</b> to God, nevertheless, <b>he</b> subsequently <b>looks to the earth</b> and beholds distress and darkness, since he returns to his idol worship. |
| Isaiah 8:22 | “And he shall look to the earth, and behold distress and darkness, | Avodah Zarah53a:6 | <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, when he shall be hungry, he shall fret, and curse his king and his god, and turn his face upward”</b> (Isaiah 8:21). <b>And it is written after</b> this verse: <b>“And he shall look to the earth, and behold distress and darkness,</b> the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness” (Isaiah 8:22).

| Isaiah 8:23 | anyone who torments the Jewish people becomes a leader, as it is stated: “For there is no weariness to him that is set against her; at the first He lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali and afterward He afflicted her more grievously by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan and the Galilee of the nations” | Sanhedrin 104b:7 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And her tears are on her cheeks”</b> (Lamentations 1:2), <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is <b>like a woman who cries over the husband of her youth, as it is stated: “Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth”</b> (Joel 1:8). With regard to the verse: <b>“Her adversaries have become the head”</b> (Lamentations 1:5), <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This indicates that <b>anyone who torments the Jewish people becomes a leader, as it is stated: “For there is no weariness to him that is set against her; at the first He lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali and afterward He afflicted her more grievously by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan and the Galilee of the nations”</b> (Isaiah 8:23). <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> From this verse one derives that <b>anyone who harasses Israel does not</b> grow <b>weary.</b> |
| Isaiah 8:23 | all of Jerusalem. The prophet came and said to him: “For there is no weariness [ mu’af ] that is set [ mutzak ] against her” | Sanhedrin 94b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But what is the reason</b> that Sennacherib <b>was punished</b> if he was merely fulfilling God’s command? The Gemara answers: <b>The prophet prophesied about</b> the destruction of the kingdom of Israel and the exile of <b>the ten tribes,</b> but <b>he directed his attention to</b> destroy <b>all of Jerusalem. The prophet came and said to him: “For there is no weariness [<i>mu’af</i> ] that is set [<i>mutzak</i>] against her”</b> (Isaiah 8:23). <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Berekhya says</b> that the verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>A nation</b> that is <b>weary [<i>ayef</i> ]</b> from its constant engagement <b>in Torah</b> study <b>is not delivered into the hands of one who oppresses [<i>metzik</i>] it.</b> |
| Isaiah 9:4 | The verse states: “For every boot [ sa’on ] stamped with fierceness, | Sotah 8b:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the relatively large measurement of <b>a <i>se’a</i>,</b> which alludes to a significant sin. <b>From where</b> do I know <b>to include</b> even lesser sins that are comparable to smaller measurements, e.g., <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>tarkav</i>] and a half-<i>tarkav</i>; a <i>kav</i> and a half-<i>kav</i>; a quarter-<i>kav</i> and half of a quarter-<i>kav</i>; an eighth-<i>kav</i> [<i>toman</i>] and an <i>ukla</i>,</b> which is one-thirty-second of a <i>kav</i>. <b>From where</b> is it derived that all these lesser sins are also dealt with in accordance with the measure of the sin? <b>The verse states: “For every boot [<i>sa’on</i>] stamped with fierceness,</b> and every cloak rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire” (Isaiah 9:4), indicating that every <i>sa’on</i>, which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi interprets as a small <i>se’a</i>, is “stamped with fierceness” and doesn’t go unpunished. |
| Isaiah 9:4 | “For every boot stamped with fierceness” | Sotah 9a:5 | § The Gemara questions the need for two verses to indicate that small transgressions are addressed through one significant punishment. <b>And since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> that small transgressions are combined and punished together <b>from:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“For every boot stamped with fierceness”</b> (Isaiah 9:4)? The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach that even small transgressions are punished <b>by the measure,</b> i.e., with a punishment appropriate to the transgression. |
| Isaiah 9:5 | as it is written: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele Joez El Gibbor Abi Ad Sar Shalom” | Sanhedrin 94a:11 | § The verse states: <b>“Therefore shall the Master, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones [<i>mishmanav</i>] leanness”</b> (Isaiah 10:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase “send among <b>his fat ones leanness”?</b> The meaning is that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Hezekiah, who has eight [<i>shemona</i>] names, come, and exact retribution from Sennacherib, who has eight names.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The eight names of <b>Hezekiah</b> are <b>as it is written: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele Joez El Gibbor Abi Ad Sar Shalom”</b> (Isaiah 9:5). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> an additional name, <b>Hezekiah?</b> The Gemara explains: That was not a given name; rather, it is an appellation based on the fact <b>that God strengthened him [<i>ḥizzeko</i>]. Alternatively,</b> he was called <b>Hezekiah</b> due to the fact <b>that he strengthened</b> the devotion of <b>the Jewish people to their Father in Heaven.</b> |
| Isaiah 9:6 | “That the government may be increased [ lemarbe ] and of peace there be no end, | Sanhedrin 94a:4 | § Apropos Hezekiah, the Gemara cites that which is stated: <b>“That the government may be increased [<i>lemarbe</i>] and of peace there be no end,</b> upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it and uphold it through justice and through righteousness, from now and forever; the zeal of the Lord of hosts does perform this” (Isaiah 9:6). <b>Rabbi Tanḥum says</b> that <b>bar Kappara taught in Tzippori: Due to what</b> reason <b>is it that every</b> letter <b><i>mem</i> in the middle of a word is open and this</b> <i>mem</i>, of the word <i>lemarbe</i>, <b>is closed?</b> In the Masoretic text, the letter <i>mem</i> in the word “<i>lemarbe</i>” is written in the form of a <i>mem</i> that appears at the end of a word, closed on all four sides. This is because <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to designate</b> King <b>Hezekiah</b> as the <b>Messiah and</b> to designate <b>Sennacherib</b> and Assyria, respectively, as <b>Gog and Magog,</b> all from the prophecy of Ezekiel with regard to the end of days (Ezekiel, chapter 38), and the confrontation between them would culminate in the final redemption. |
| Isaiah 9:6 | since the days of Hezekiah, as it is stated: “For the increase of the realm and for peace without end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice; from now and forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts performs this” | Shabbat 55a:16 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The merit of the Patriarchs ceased <b>since the days of Hezekiah, as it is stated: “For the increase of the realm and for peace without end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice; from now and forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts performs this”</b> (Isaiah 9:6). That is to say, from this point on, the merit of the Patriarchs will not protect Israel, leaving only the zeal of the Lord. |
| Isaiah 9:7 | sent a word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel” | Chullin 91a:20 | The Gemara continues with other expositions pertaining to the sciatic nerve. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The Lord <b>sent a word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel”</b> (Isaiah 9:7)? <b>“He sent a word to Jacob”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the sciatic nerve. “And it has fallen upon Israel”;</b> this teaches <b>that its prohibition has</b> been <b>extended to the entire Jewish people.</b> |
| Isaiah 9:16 | said to him: “Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, nor shall He have compassion on their orphans and widows, for everyone is a flatterer and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks obscenity. For all this His anger is not turned away, and His hand is still outstretched” | Ketubot 8b:5 | <b>And there are</b> those who <b>say</b> that the child who died <b>was</b> not a small child, but <b>a youth, and this is what</b> the disseminator <b>said to him: “Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, nor shall He have compassion on their orphans and widows, for everyone is a flatterer and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks obscenity. For all this His anger is not turned away, and His hand is still outstretched”</b> (Isaiah 9:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And His hand is still outstretched”? Rav Ḥanan bar Rav said: Everyone knows why a bride enters the wedding canopy.</b> It is the step before consummation of the marriage. <b>However,</b> one should not speak about it unnecessarily, as <b>anyone who profanes his mouth and issues a matter of profanity from his mouth, even if a positive decree of seventy years was sealed for him,</b> nevertheless, <b>it is transformed for him into an evil</b> decree. |
| Isaiah 9:16 | and are not answered, as it is stated: “Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is ungodly and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks wantonness. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still” | Shabbat 33a:8 | <b>Due to the sin of vulgar speech, troubles abound, and harsh decrees are renewed, and the youth among the enemies of Israel,</b> a euphemistic reference to Israel, <b>die,</b> and <b>orphans and widows cry out</b> for help <b>and are not answered, as it is stated: “Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is ungodly and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks wantonness. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still”</b> (Isaiah 9:16). |
| Isaiah 9:19 | “He decrees on the right and there is hunger, and consumes on the left and they are not satisfied” | Bava Batra25b:6 | § <b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the Temple was destroyed the southern wind has not brought rain, as it is stated</b> in the description of the destruction of the Temple: <b>“He decrees on the right and there is hunger, and consumes on the left and they are not satisfied”</b> (Isaiah 9:19). This means that God decreed that the southern wind, which is called right, shall bring famine with it. <b>And it is written: “North and right, You have created them”</b> (Psalms 89:13). This proves that the term right means south. |
| Isaiah 9:19 | And it is written: “And one snatches on the right hand, and is hungry; and he eats on the left hand, and is not satisfied; they eat every man the flesh of his own arm [ besar zero ’ o ]” | Shabbat 33a:1 | <b>who eat and do nothing</b> to support themselves, and cause their husbands to commit the sin of theft. <b>And it is written: “I have smitten you with blight and mildew; the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees has the palmerworm devoured”</b> (Amos 4:9). <b>And it is written: “That which the palmerworm has left the locust has eaten; and that which the locust has left the cankerworm has eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left the caterpillar has eaten”</b> (Joel 1:4). <b>And it is written: “And one snatches on the right hand, and is hungry; and he eats on the left hand, and is not satisfied; they eat every man the flesh of his own arm [<i>besar zero</i>’<i>o</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 9:19). <b>Do not read</b> it: <b>The flesh of his own arm [<i>besar zero</i>’<i>o</i>]; rather, the flesh of his own offspring [<i>besar zaro</i>].</b> All the punishments for theft listed above were explicitly mentioned in the verses. |
| Isaiah 9:19 | arms, to fulfill that which is stated: “Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm” | Taanit 5a:10 | Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rabbi Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> In <b>the first year they ate</b> that <b>which was in their houses;</b> in <b>the second</b> year <b>they ate</b> that <b>which was in their fields;</b> in <b>the third</b> year they ate the <b>meat of</b> their remaining <b>kosher animals;</b> in <b>the fourth</b> year they ate the <b>meat of</b> their remaining <b>non-kosher animals;</b> in <b>the fifth</b> year they ate the <b>meat of repugnant creatures and creeping animals,</b> i.e., any insects they found; in <b>the sixth</b> year they ate the <b>flesh of their sons and their daughters;</b> and in <b>the seventh</b> year they ate the <b>flesh of their</b> own <b>arms, to fulfill that which is stated: “Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm”</b> (Isaiah 9:19). |
| Isaiah 10:13 | “I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants” | Berakhot 28a:6 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: You are forbidden to enter into the congregation. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: You are permitted to enter into the congregation. Rabban Gamliel said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord;</b> even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the congregation of the Lord forever” (Deuteronomy 23:4)? How can you permit him to enter the congregation? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Do Ammon and Moab reside in their place? Sennacherib already came and,</b> through his policy of population transfer, <b>scrambled all the nations</b> and settled other nations in place of Ammon. Consequently, the current residents of Ammon and Moab are not ethnic Ammonites and Moabites, <b>as it is stated in</b> reference to Sennacherib: <b>“I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants”</b> (Isaiah 10:13). <b>And</b> although it is conceivable that this particular convert is an ethnic Ammonite, nevertheless, there is no need for concern due to the halakhic principle: <b>Anything that parts</b> from a group <b>parts from the majority,</b> and the assumption is that he is from the majority of nations whose members are permitted to enter the congregation. |
| Isaiah 10:13 | “And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures” | Yoma 54a:6 | The Gemara explains its objection: <b>But Sennacherib, king of Assyria,</b> had <b>already come, and</b> through his policy of forced population transfer <b>he had scrambled all</b> the nations of <b>the lands, as it is stated</b> in reference to Sennacherib: <b>“And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures”</b> (Isaiah 10:13). This indicates that the children of Simeon were also exiled, despite the fact that the verse states: “There to this day.” The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Ulla’s statement. |
| Isaiah 10:16 | “Therefore shall the Master, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones [ mishmanav ] leanness” | Sanhedrin 94a:11 | § The verse states: <b>“Therefore shall the Master, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones [<i>mishmanav</i>] leanness”</b> (Isaiah 10:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase “send among <b>his fat ones leanness”?</b> The meaning is that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Hezekiah, who has eight [<i>shemona</i>] names, come, and exact retribution from Sennacherib, who has eight names.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The eight names of <b>Hezekiah</b> are <b>as it is written: “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele Joez El Gibbor Abi Ad Sar Shalom”</b> (Isaiah 9:5). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> an additional name, <b>Hezekiah?</b> The Gemara explains: That was not a given name; rather, it is an appellation based on the fact <b>that God strengthened him [<i>ḥizzeko</i>]. Alternatively,</b> he was called <b>Hezekiah</b> due to the fact <b>that he strengthened</b> the devotion of <b>the Jewish people to their Father in Heaven.</b> |
| Isaiah 10:16 | “And beneath his glory shall be kindled a blaze like the blaze of a fire” | Sanhedrin 94a:16 | The Gemara cites additional verses written with regard to Sennacherib. <b>“And beneath his glory shall be kindled a blaze like the blaze of a fire”</b> (Isaiah 10:16). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A blaze was kindled <b>beneath his glory, but</b> it was <b>not actually</b> kindled on <b>his glory.</b> The blaze consumed the bodies of the troops of Sennacherib beneath their garments, which were referred to as glory, <b>as</b> in <b>that</b> practice <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who would <b>call his garments: My glory. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It means <b>beneath his actual glory,</b> i.e., the blaze consumed their souls, and their flesh was not consumed, <b>like the burning of the sons of Aaron. Just as there,</b> the death of the sons of Aaron entailed <b>the burning of the soul, and the body</b> remained <b>intact, so too here,</b> the death of the troops of Sennacherib entailed <b>the burning of the soul, and the body</b> remained <b>intact.</b> |
| Isaiah 10:16 | among his fat ones leanness” | Sanhedrin 95b:9 | <b>Rav Ashi says: It is also precise</b> in the formulation of the verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “Therefore shall the Master, the Lord of hosts, send <b>among his fat ones leanness”</b> (Isaiah 10:16), indicating that it was <b>the fat,</b> i.e., significant, <b>among them</b> who were afflicted. <b>Ravina says:</b> The language <b>is also precise</b> in the formulation of another verse, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord sent an angel, who obliterated the mighty men-at-arms and the leaders and captains in the camp</b> of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefacedly to his own land. <b>And when he came into the house of his God, his own offspring slew him there with a sword”</b> (II Chronicles 32:21). The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that the leaders of the regiment were the ones killed. |
| Isaiah 10:16 | and under his honor He will burn a burning like a burning fire” | Shabbat 113b:12 | It was mentioned earlier that Rabbi Yoḥanan called his clothing his honor. The Gemara cites the interpretation of the verse that speaks about the downfall of the king of Assyria: “Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send leanness to his fat ones <b>and under his honor He will burn a burning like a burning fire”</b> (Isaiah 10:16).<br><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “And under his honor,” but not his actual honor.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> follows <b>his own reasoning,</b> for he <b>called his clothing my honor,</b> which means that the bodies of the king of Assyria’s soldiers were burned. However, their garments were miraculously not burned. |
| Isaiah 10:19 | as it is stated: “And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them” | Sanhedrin 95b:13 | <b>And how many of</b> the soldiers <b>remained</b> alive? <b>Rav says: Ten</b> soldiers, <b>as it is stated: “And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them”</b> (Isaiah 10:19). <b>And what number can a child</b> easily <b>write?</b> It is the number <b>ten,</b> represented by the letter <i>yod</i>, which is the smallest letter. <b>And Shmuel says: Nine</b> remained, <b>as it is stated: “And gleanings shall be left of him, as in the beating of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the branches of a fruitful tree”</b> (Isaiah 17:6). Four and five total nine. |
| Isaiah 10:27 | “And it shall come to pass on that day, his burden shall be taken from on your shoulder, and his yoke from on your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed due to fatness [ shamen ]” | Sanhedrin 94b:13 | § It is stated with regard to the downfall of Assyria: <b>“And it shall come to pass on that day, his burden shall be taken from on your shoulder, and his yoke from on your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed due to fatness [<i>shamen</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 10:27). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: The yoke of Sennacherib was destroyed due to the oil [<i>shemen</i>] of Hezekiah that would burn in the synagogues and study halls</b> when the Jewish people were engaged in Torah study at night. |
| Isaiah 10:30 | “Poor [ aniyya ] Anathoth” | Sanhedrin 95a:1 | <b>“Poor [<i>aniyya</i>] Anathoth”</b> (Isaiah 10:30)? <b>Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, is destined to prophesy about</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>from Anathoth, as it is written: “The statements of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin”</b> (Jeremiah 1:1). |
| Isaiah 10:32 | “This very day shall he halt at Nov” | Sanhedrin 95a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“This very day shall he halt at Nov”</b> (Isaiah 10:32)? <b>Rav Huna says: That</b> was the final <b>day</b> that <b>remained from</b> the punishment that the Jewish people received from <b>the sin of Nov</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 22). <b>The astrologers said to</b> Sennacherib: <b>If you go</b> and conquer them <b>now, you will overcome</b> the Jewish people; <b>and if not, you will not overcome</b> the Jewish people. The Gemara relates: <b>He walked</b> and traversed <b>in one day a road</b> upon <b>which one must walk for ten days</b> in order to traverse it. |
| Isaiah 10:33 | “And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down [ gedu’im ]” | Sotah 5a:10 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him,</b> it is <b>fitting to hew him down, as a tree designated for idolatry [<i>asheira</i>]</b> is hewn down, as <b>it is written here</b> with regard to the arrogant: <b>“And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down [<i>gedu’im</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 10:33), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to trees designated for idolatry: <b>“And hew down [<i>teggade’un</i>] their trees worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asheireihem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:5). |
| Isaiah 10:34 | As if you are not a king, Jerusalem will not be handed over into your hand, as it is written: “And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one” | Gittin 56b:1 | <b>in truth, you are a king,</b> if not now, then in the future. <b>As if you are not a king, Jerusalem will not be handed over into your hand, as it is written: “And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one”</b> (Isaiah 10:34). <b>And “mighty one”</b> means <b>only a king, as it is written: “And their mighty one shall be of themselves,</b> and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them” (Jeremiah 30:21), indicating that “mighty one” parallels “ruler.” <b>And “Lebanon”</b> means <b>only the Temple, as it is stated: “That good mountain and the Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25). <b>And</b> as for <b>what you said</b> with your second comment: <b>If I am a king why didn’t you come to me until now, there are zealots among us</b> who <b>did not allow us</b> to do this. |
| Isaiah 11:1 | isn’t it written: “And a branch [ netzer ] shall grow out of his roots” | Sanhedrin 43a:24 | Then <b>they brought Netzer in</b> to stand trial. <b>He said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Netzer be executed?</b> But <b>isn’t it written: “And a branch [<i>netzer</i>] shall grow out of his roots”</b> (Isaiah 11:1)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Netzer shall be executed, as it is written: “But you are cast out of your grave like an abhorred branch [<i>netzer</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 14:19). |
| Isaiah 11:2 | as it is written: “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord” | Sanhedrin 93b:6 | The <b>Messiah</b> was blessed with six virtues, <b>as it is written: “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 11:2); <b>and it is written: “And his delight [<i>vahariḥo</i>] shall be the fear of the Lord,</b> and he shall neither judge after the sight of his eyes, nor decide after the hearing of his ears” (Isaiah 11:3). |
| Isaiah 11:3 | and it is written: “And his delight [ vahariḥo ] shall be the fear of the Lord, | Sanhedrin 93b:6 | The <b>Messiah</b> was blessed with six virtues, <b>as it is written: “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 11:2); <b>and it is written: “And his delight [<i>vahariḥo</i>] shall be the fear of the Lord,</b> and he shall neither judge after the sight of his eyes, nor decide after the hearing of his ears” (Isaiah 11:3). |
| Isaiah 11:9 | as the waters cover the sea” | Bava Batra74b:10 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Conclude from here</b> that <b>the name of the minister of the sea is Rahab, and were it not for waters</b> of the sea that <b>cover him, no creature could withstand his smell,</b> as his corpse emits a terrible stench. <b>As it is stated: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain;</b> for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, <b>as the waters cover the sea”</b> (Isaiah 11:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“cover the sea”; rather</b> read it as: <b>Cover the minister of the sea,</b> i.e., the term sea is referring to the minister of the sea, not to the sea itself. |
| Isaiah 12:1 | I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me; Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me” | Niddah 31a:15 | <b>Rav Yosef taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And on that day you shall say: <b>I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me; Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me”</b> (Isaiah 12:1)? <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>is the verse speaking?</b> |
| Isaiah 12:3 | as the verse states: “With joy [ sason ] you shall draw water | Sukkah 48b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the customs accompanying the drawing of the water, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Eina said</b> that it is <b>as the verse states: “With joy [<i>sason</i>] you shall draw water</b> out of the springs of salvation” (Isaiah 12:3), indicating that the water was to be drawn from the spring and the rite performed in extreme joy. |
| Isaiah 12:3 | Mar Zutra said: The one who taught sho’eva is not mistaken, and the one who taught ḥashuva is not mistaken. The one who taught sho’eva is not mistaken, as it is written: “And you shall draw [ ushavtem ] water with joy | Sukkah 50b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda and Rav Eina</b> disagreed: <b>One</b> of them <b>teaches</b> that the celebration was called the Celebration of <b>Drawing [<i>sho’eva</i>] and one</b> of them <b>teaches</b> that it was called the <b>significant [<i>ḥashuva</i>]</b> celebration. <b>Mar Zutra said: The one who taught <i>sho’eva</i> is not mistaken, and the one who taught <i>ḥashuva</i> is not mistaken. The one who taught <i>sho’eva</i> is not mistaken, as it is written: “And you shall draw [<i>ushavtem</i>] water with joy</b> from the wells of salvation” (Isaiah 12:3), and its name reflects the fact that it is a celebration of the water libation. <b>And the one who taught <i>ḥashuva</i> is not mistaken, as Rav Naḥman said: It is a significant mitzva and</b> it originated <b>from the six days of Creation.</b> |
| Isaiah 12:4 | “And on that day shall you say: Give thanks unto the Lord, proclaim His name, | Avodah Zarah24b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what song did they recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> They recited the song that follows the verse: <b>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</b> this song unto the Lord” (Exodus 15:1). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says</b> that it was: <b>“And on that day shall you say: Give thanks unto the Lord, proclaim His name,</b> declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted” (Isaiah 12:4). |
| Isaiah 13:3 | “I have commanded My consecrated ones; | Berakhot 8b:16 | While they have been praised here regarding certain specific aspects of their conduct, the Gemara proceeds to offer another perspective on the Persians based on a verse describing the destruction of Babylonia at the hands of the Persian and Median armies: <b>“I have commanded My consecrated ones;</b> I have also called My mighty ones for My anger, even My proudly exulting ones” (Isaiah 13:3). <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the Persians who are consecrated and designated for Gehenna,</b> for they have been sent by God to carry out his mission of anger, and they will be sent to Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 13:21 | But isn’t it written: “And benot ya’ana shall dwell there” | Chullin 64b:5 | The Gemara persists: <b>And</b> is <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>not</b> its name? <b>But isn’t it written: “I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the daughters [<i>benot</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Micah 1:8)? The Gemara responds: The verse means: I will make mourning <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that mourns for its children.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And <i>benot ya’ana</i> shall dwell there”</b> (Isaiah 13:21)? The Gemara responds: Here too, the verse means: And they shall dwell there <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that dwells with its children.</b> |
| Isaiah 13:21 | “And demons shall dance there” | Shabbat 149b:12 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited</b> even nowadays <b>to stand in</b> the ruins of <b>the house of that wicked man,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, in Babylonia, for <b>it is stated</b> about that place: <b>“And demons shall dance there”</b> (Isaiah 13:21). There is concern that one may be injured by the harmful forces there (Maharsha). |
| Isaiah 14:1 | that it is stated: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [ venispeḥu ] to the house of Jacob” | Kiddushin 70b:15 | <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says: Converts are</b> as <b>difficult for the Jewish people as a scab.</b> The proof is <b>that it is stated: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [<i>venispeḥu</i>] to the house of Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 14:1). <b>It is written here “<i>venispeḥu</i>,” and it is written there,</b> among the types of leprosy: <b>“And for a sore and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:56). The use of a term with a similar root indicates that converts are like a scab for the Jewish people. |
| Isaiah 14:1 | as it is written: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [ venispeḥu ] to the house of Jacob” | Yevamot 47b:5 | The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a potential <b>convert who comes to</b> a court in order to <b>convert,</b> the judges of the court <b>say to him: What did you see that</b> motivated <b>you</b> to <b>come to convert? And they inform him</b> of <b>some of the lenient mitzvot and some of the stringent mitzvot.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> to say this to him? It is so <b>that if he</b> is going to <b>withdraw</b> from the conversion process, <b>let him withdraw</b> already at this stage. He should not be convinced to continue, <b>as Rabbi Ḥelbo said: Converts are as harmful to the Jewish people as a</b> leprous <b>scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]</b> on the skin, <b>as it is written: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [<i>venispeḥu</i>] to the house of Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 14:1). This alludes to the fact that the cleaving of the convert to the Jewish people is like a scab. |
| Isaiah 14:4 | How has the oppressor ceased. The exactor of gold has ceased” | Shabbat 149b:15 | On a related note, the verse states: “And you shall take up this parable against the king of Babylonia and you shall say: <b>How has the oppressor ceased. The exactor of gold has ceased”</b> (Isaiah 14:4). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The meaning of this verse is that <b>this nation that said:</b> |
| Isaiah 14:5 | that which is written: “The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers” | Shabbat 139a:9 | <b>Rabbi Mallai said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers”</b> (Isaiah 14:5)? He explains: <b>“The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked”; these are the judges who have become staffs for their attendants.</b> The attendants abuse people, and the judges provide the attendants with legal backing and moral support. <b>“The rod of the rulers”; these are the Torah scholars</b> who are members of <b>the families of the judges.</b> These Torah scholars assist their relatives, the judges, conceal their faults. <b>Mar Zutra said: These are the Torah scholars who teach communal <i>halakhot</i> to ignorant judges.</b> They teach ignorant judges just enough Torah and modes of conduct to prevent the people from realizing how ignorant they are, enabling them to maintain their positions. |
| Isaiah 14:7 | of that wicked man, laughter could not be found in the mouth of any creature, as it is stated: “The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing” | Shabbat 149b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of the days</b> of the life <b>of that wicked man, laughter could not be found in the mouth of any creature, as it is stated: “The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing”</b> (Isaiah 14:7). This proves <b>by inference</b> that <b>until now there was not any song.</b> |
| Isaiah 14:10 | Have you also become weak like us? Have you become like us [ eleinu nimshalta ]?” | Shabbat 149b:14 | <b>And Rav Yehuda</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rav said: When that wicked man descended into Gehenna, everyone who had</b> already <b>descended to Gehenna trembled,</b> and <b>they said,</b> referring to themselves in third person: <b>Perhaps he is coming to rule over them; or is he coming to be weakened like them? As it is stated:</b> “They all answer and say to you: <b>Have you also become weak like us? Have you become like us [<i>eleinu nimshalta</i>]?”</b> (Isaiah 14:10). The Hebrew phrase: <i>Eleinu nimshalta</i>, can mean: Have you become like us, or alternatively: Have you come to rule over us. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down and be laid with the uncircumcised”</b> (Ezekiel 32:19). This confirmed that Nebuchadnezzar has the same status in Gehenna as everyone else. |
| Isaiah 14:12 | ḥalashim , is a word for lots? As it is written: “How have you fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How have you been cut down to the ground, casting lots [ ḥolesh ] over the nations!” | Shabbat 149b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it be <b>inferred that this</b> term used in the mishna, <b><i>ḥalashim</i>, is a word for lots? As it is written: “How have you fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How have you been cut down to the ground, casting lots [<i>ḥolesh</i>] over the nations!”</b> (Isaiah 14:12), and <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> This verse <b>teaches</b> us <b>that he,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>would cast lots [<i>ḥolesh</i>] for the royal leaders</b> of the nations he had captured, <b>in order to know whose day</b> it was to service him with <b>homosexual relations. And it is written: “All the kings of the nations, all of them</b> sleep in glory, every one in his own house” (Isaiah 14:18). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The meaning of this verse is <b>that they rested from homosexual relations.</b> |
| Isaiah 14:14 | when he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High” | Chagigah 13a:2 | The Gemara comments: <b>Until here, you have permission to speak; from this</b> point <b>forward you do not have permission to speak, as it is written in the book of Ben Sira: Seek not things concealed from you, nor search those hidden from you. Reflect on that which is permitted to you; you have no business with secret matters. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: What response did the Divine Voice provide to that wicked man,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>when he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High”</b> (Isaiah 14:14), thereby intending to rise to heaven? <b>A Divine Voice came and said to him: Wicked man, son of a wicked man, descendant,</b> i.e., follower of the ways, <b>of Nimrod the wicked, who caused the entire world to rebel against Him during</b> the time of <b>his reign.</b> |
| Isaiah 14:14 | he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds” | Chullin 89a:7 | <b>But the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are not so. I granted greatness to Nimrod,</b> yet <b>he said: “Come, let us build a city</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name” (Genesis 11:4). I granted greatness <b>to Pharaoh,</b> yet <b>he said: “Who is the Lord”</b> (Exodus 5:2). I granted greatness <b>to Sennacherib,</b> yet he said: <b>“Who are they among all the gods of the countries</b> that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand” (II Kings 18:35). I granted greatness <b>to Nebuchadnezzar,</b> yet <b>he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</b> (Isaiah 14:14). I granted greatness <b>to Ḥiram, king of Tyre,</b> yet <b>he said: “I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the seas”</b> (Ezekiel 28:2). |
| Isaiah 14:14 | when he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High” | Pesachim 94a:13 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge, <b>as Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: What response did the Divine Voice answer to that wicked man,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>when he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High”</b> (Isaiah 14:14)? <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: Wicked man, son of a wicked man,</b> |
| Isaiah 14:15 | say: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High” | Chagigah 13a:4 | And <b>above them,</b> above all the firmaments, <b>are the divine creatures. The feet of the divine creatures correspond</b> in distance <b>to all</b> the firmaments; <b>the ankles of the animals correspond to all of them, the shins of the animals correspond to all of them, the knees of the animals correspond to all of them, the thighs of the animals correspond to all of them, the bodies of the animals correspond to all of them, the necks of the animals correspond to all of them, the heads of the animals correspond to all of them,</b> and <b>the horns of the animals correspond to all of them. Above them</b> is the <b>Throne of Glory: The feet of the Throne of Glory correspond to all of them, the Throne of Glory corresponds to all of them,</b> and the <b>living, almighty, lofty, exalted King dwells above them. And you,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>say: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High”</b> (Isaiah 14:15), but the next verse states: <b>“Yet you shall be brought down to the netherworld, to the uttermost parts of the pit”</b> (Isaiah 14:15). |
| Isaiah 14:15 | “Yet you shall be brought down to the netherworld, to the uttermost parts of the pit” | Pesachim 94b:2 | In contrast, <b>from the earth to the</b> first <b>firmament</b> of seven (see Ḥagiga 12b) <b>is a walking</b> distance <b>of five hundred years, and the thickness of the firmament is a walking</b> distance <b>of five hundred years,</b> which is equal to approximately 1.8 million parasangs, <b>and between each firmament is</b> another <b>walking</b> distance <b>of five hundred years, and so too between each and every firmament.</b> Therefore, how can you, Nebuchadnezzar, hope to reach the heavens in your lifetime, such that you say: “I will be like the Most High”? Rather, as the verse continues: <b>“Yet you shall be brought down to the netherworld, to the uttermost parts of the pit”</b> (Isaiah 14:15). In any event, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rava’s opinion that the thickness of the firmament is only one thousand parasangs. |
| Isaiah 14:18 | homosexual relations. And it is written: “All the kings of the nations, all of them | Shabbat 149b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it be <b>inferred that this</b> term used in the mishna, <b><i>ḥalashim</i>, is a word for lots? As it is written: “How have you fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How have you been cut down to the ground, casting lots [<i>ḥolesh</i>] over the nations!”</b> (Isaiah 14:12), and <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> This verse <b>teaches</b> us <b>that he,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>would cast lots [<i>ḥolesh</i>] for the royal leaders</b> of the nations he had captured, <b>in order to know whose day</b> it was to service him with <b>homosexual relations.

| Isaiah 14:19 | They said to him: Yes, Netzer shall be executed, as it is written: “But you are cast out of your grave like an abhorred branch [ netzer ]” | Sanhedrin 43a:24 | Then <b>they brought Netzer in</b> to stand trial. <b>He said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Netzer be executed?</b> But <b>isn’t it written: “And a branch [<i>netzer</i>] shall grow out of his roots”</b> (Isaiah 11:1)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Netzer shall be executed, as it is written: “But you are cast out of your grave like an abhorred branch [<i>netzer</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 14:19). |
| Isaiah 14:22 | and cut off from Babylonia name, and remnant, and offspring [ nin ], and posterity, says the Lord” | Megillah 10b:18 | § The Gemara cites prologues utilized by various Sages to introduce study of the Megilla: <b>Rabbi Yonatan introduced this passage,</b> the book of Esther, <b>with an introduction from here: “For I will rise up against them,</b> says the Lord of hosts, <b>and cut off from Babylonia name, and remnant, and offspring [<i>nin</i>], and posterity, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 14:22). This verse may be interpreted homiletically: <b>“Name,” this is</b> the <b>writing</b> of ancient Babylonia that will disappear from the world. <b>“Remnant,” this is</b> the <b>language</b> of ancient Babylonia. <b>“Offspring,” this is</b> their <b>kingdom. And “posterity,” this is Vashti,</b> who according to tradition was Nebuchadnezzar’s granddaughter, and the book of Esther relates how she too was removed from the throne. |
| Isaiah 14:23 | “And I will sweep it with the broom [ vetetetiha bemate’ateh ] of destruction” | Bava Kamma55a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If <b>one sees</b> the letter <b><i>tet</i> in his dream,</b> it is <b>a good sign for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because</b> the word <b>good [<i>tov</i>] is written</b> in the Torah and begins with the letter <i>tet</i>, then one could <b>say</b> instead that it is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And I will sweep it with the broom [<i>vetetetiha bemate’ateh</i>] of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23), which also contains the letter <i>tet</i> several times but is referring to punishment. The Gemara answers: <b>We mean</b> that when someone sees <b>one <i>tet</i></b> in his dream, it is a good sign, but this latter verse contains several. |
| Isaiah 14:23 | Run, righteous ones, and fulfill the will of your Master. When Mar, son of Ravina, would arrive in Babylonia he would take earth in his kerchief and throw it outside, to fulfill that which is said: “And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction” | Berakhot 57b:22 | The Gemara relates that <b>when Rava would see donkeys carrying earth</b> from Babylonia, <b>he would slap their backs with his hand and say</b> to them: <b>Run, righteous ones, and fulfill the will of your Master. When Mar, son of Ravina, would arrive in Babylonia he would take earth in his kerchief and throw it outside, to fulfill that which is said: “And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). <b>Rav Ashi said: I never heard the</b> statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna,</b> that one who sees Babylonia the wicked must recite five blessings. <b>However, based on my independent reasoning, I recited all of the blessings.</b> |
| Isaiah 14:23 | and pools of water” | Berakhot 58a:1 | With regard to Babylonia, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said:</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed.</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it, <b>as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for the bittern,</b> a wading bird, <b>and pools of water”</b> (Isaiah 14:23); not only will it be destroyed, but the site will become a habitat for destructive, environmentally harmful creatures. When <b>Samaria was cursed,</b> however, <b>its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field, a place for the planting of vineyards”</b> (Micah 1:6); although destroyed, it will serve a beneficial purpose. |
| Isaiah 14:23 | Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed, as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for wild birds, and pools of water” | Eruvin 18b:18 | <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said:</b> When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed</b> along with it. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed.</b> He explains: When <b>Babylonia was cursed, its neighbors were cursed, as it is written: “I will also make it a possession for wild birds, and pools of water”</b> (Isaiah 14:23), and the arrival of predatory animals brings harm to the surrounding neighbors as well. When <b>Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed, as it is written: “Therefore I will turn Samaria into a heap of rubble in the field</b> |
| Isaiah 14:23 | “And I will tatei it with the matatei of destruction” | Megillah 18a:29 | And similarly, <b>the Sages did not know what is</b> meant by the word <i>matatei</i> in the verse: <b>“And I will <i>tatei</i> it with the <i>matatei</i> of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to her friend: Take a <i>tateita</i> and <i>tati</i> the house,</b> from which they understood that a <i>matatei</i> is a broom, and the verb <i>tati</i> means to sweep. |
| Isaiah 14:23 | “And sweep it [ vetetetiha ] with the broom [ matatei ] of destruction” | Rosh Hashanah26b:5 | It is further related that <b>the Sages did not know the meaning</b> of the words in the verse: <b>“And sweep it [<i>vetetetiha</i>] with the broom [<i>matatei</i>] of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to her workmate: Take a broom [<i>tateita</i>] and sweep</b> [<b><i>ta’ati</i></b>] <b>the house,”</b> and they understood the meaning of these words. |
| Isaiah 16:1 | peace comes to the world, as it is stated: “Send the lambs [ khar ] for the ruler of the land” | Niddah 31b:5 | § <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says: When a male comes into the world,</b> i.e., when a male baby is born, <b>peace comes to the world, as it is stated: “Send the lambs [<i>khar</i>] for the ruler of the land”</b> (Isaiah 16:1). This <i>khar</i>, or <i>kar</i>, a gift one sends the ruler, contributes to the stability of the government and peace, and the word <b>male [<i>zakhar</i>]</b> can be interpreted homiletically as an abbreviation of: <b>This is a <i>kar</i> [<i>zeh kar</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 16:1 | as it is stated: “Send the lamb to the ruler of the land from the peaks of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion” | Sanhedrin 96b:14 | Ammon and Moab <b>sent to him: Come on the peaks of mountains,</b> where the rain does not pool, <b>as it is stated: “Send the lamb to the ruler of the land from the peaks of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion”</b> (Isaiah 16:1). Nebuchadnezzar <b>sent to them: If I come</b> to Jerusalem, <b>I</b> will <b>have no place to dwell</b> while laying siege to the city. Ammon and Moab <b>sent to him: Their burial caves are superior to your palaces,</b> and you can clear the caves and dwell there, <b>as it is written: “At that time, says the Lord, they shall remove the bones of the kings of Judea, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves; and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all of the hosts of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked”</b> (Jeremiah 8:1–2). Ultimately Nebuchadnezzar came to conquer Judea and removed the corpses to make room for his army. |
| Isaiah 17:6 | as it is stated: “And gleanings shall be left of him, as in the beating of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the branches of a fruitful tree” | Sanhedrin 95b:13 | <b>And how many of</b> the soldiers <b>remained</b> alive? <b>Rav says: Ten</b> soldiers, <b>as it is stated: “And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them”</b> (Isaiah 10:19). <b>And what number can a child</b> easily <b>write?</b> It is the number <b>ten,</b> represented by the letter <i>yod</i>, which is the smallest letter. <b>And Shmuel says: Nine</b> remained, <b>as it is stated: “And gleanings shall be left of him, as in the beating of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the branches of a fruitful tree”</b> (Isaiah 17:6). Four and five total nine. |
| Isaiah 18:5 | will cease from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “And He shall sever the sprigs [ hazalzallim ] with pruning hooks” | Sanhedrin 98a:6 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The son of David will not come until the contemptuous [<i>hazalla</i>] kingdom</b> of Rome <b>will cease from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “And He shall sever the sprigs [<i>hazalzallim</i>] with pruning hooks”</b> (Isaiah 18:5). <b>And it is written thereafter: “At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts, by a people scattered and hairless”</b> (Isaiah 18:7). |
| Isaiah 18:7 | And it is written thereafter: “At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts, by a people scattered and hairless” | Sanhedrin 98a:6 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The son of David will not come until the contemptuous [<i>hazalla</i>] kingdom</b> of Rome <b>will cease from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “And He shall sever the sprigs [<i>hazalzallim</i>] with pruning hooks”</b> (Isaiah 18:5). <b>And it is written thereafter: “At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts, by a people scattered and hairless”</b> (Isaiah 18:7). |
| Isaiah 19:6 | a marsh, as it is written: “The reeds and willows [ suf ] shall wither” | Sotah 12b:1 | She placed him in <b>a marsh, as it is written: “The reeds and willows [<i>suf</i>] shall wither”</b> (Isaiah 19:6). |
| Isaiah 19:13 | from here: “The princes of Tzoan are become fools [ noalu ]” | Berakhot 63b:13 | <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “The princes of Tzoan are become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 19:13). |
| Isaiah 19:13 | “The ministers of Zoan have sinned [ no’alu ]” | Makkot 10a:20 | <b>Rav Ashi says: Anyone who loves to study in abundance,</b> i.e., with many colleagues, <b>to him shall be increase,</b> i.e., he will succeed in his studies. <b>And that is</b> parallel to that <b>which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A sword is upon the <i>baddim</i>, <i>veno’alu</i>”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? It is fitting that <b>a sword</b> be placed <b>on the necks of the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for Torah scholars, <b>who sit and engage in</b> the study of <b>the Torah individually [<i>bad bevad</i>]. Moreover, they grow foolish</b> through individual study, as <b>it is written here: <i>Veno’alu</i>, and it is written there: “For we have been foolish [<i>no’alnu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>Moreover, they</b> thereby <b>sin, as it is stated</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“And for we have sinned.” And if you wish, say</b> that <b>from here</b> it is derived that <i>no’alu</i> means sinned: <b>“The ministers of Zoan have sinned [<i>no’alu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 19:13). |
| Isaiah 19:13 | from here: “The princes of Zoan have become fools [ noalu ]…they have caused Egypt to go astray” | Taanit 7a:11 | <b>And not only that, but they sin, as it is written here: “And they shall become fools,” and it is written there: “For that we have done foolishly [<i>noalnu</i>] and for that we have sinned”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “The princes of Zoan have become fools [<i>noalu</i>]…they have caused Egypt to go astray”</b> (Isaiah 19:13). |
| Isaiah 19:18 | and swear to the Lord of hosts; | Menachot 110a:1 | <b>and swear to the Lord of hosts;</b> one shall be called the city of destruction” (Isaiah 19:18). <b>They went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt,</b> and a pillar at its border, to the Lord” (Isaiah 19:19). |
| Isaiah 19:18 | “One shall be called the city of destruction” | Menachot 110a:2 | The verse states: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 19:18). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the verse: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Yosef translates</b> into Aramaic: Concerning <b>the City of the Sun, which will be destroyed in the future, it will be said that it is one of them. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the phrase: <b>“The city of destruction [<i>heres</i>],” the term</b> <i>heres</i> <b>is</b> referring <b>to the sun? As it is written: “Who commands the sun [<i>ḥeres</i>], and it does not rise;</b> and seals up the stars” (Job 9:7). |
| Isaiah 19:19 | upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord” | Menachot 109b:16 | <b>His fellow priests wanted to kill</b> Shimi. Shimi then <b>told them the entire incident,</b> that he had been tricked by his brother Onias, so the priests <b>wanted to kill Onias.</b> Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them, and they ran after him.</b> Onias <b>ran to the palace of the king, and they ran after him. Anyone who saw him would say: This is him, this is him,</b> and he was not able to escape unnoticed. Onias <b>went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 19:19). According to Rabbi Yehuda, the temple of Onias was dedicated to the worship of God. |
| Isaiah 19:19 | “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, | Menachot 110a:1 | <b>and swear to the Lord of hosts;</b> one shall be called the city of destruction” (Isaiah 19:18). <b>They went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt,</b> and a pillar at its border, to the Lord” (Isaiah 19:19). |
| Isaiah 19:22 | afterward does He create a remedy, as it is stated: “And the Lord shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing” | Megillah 13b:13 | Rava explains: <b>As Reish Lakish said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not strike at the Jewish people unless He has</b> already <b>created a remedy for them beforehand, as it is stated: “When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered”</b> (Hosea 7:1). <b>But</b> this is <b>not so</b> with regard to <b>the nations of the world.</b> With them, God first <b>strikes them and</b> only <b>afterward does He create a remedy, as it is stated: “And the Lord shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing”</b> (Isaiah 19:22). |
| Isaiah 19:24 | He rose and said: Most of the third, | Moed Katan25b:7 | <b>When Rava</b> once <b>came to the Tigris</b> River, and he was concerned that he might be swept away by the water, <b>he said to bar Avin: Rise</b> and <b>say</b> a prayer on our behalf. <b>He rose and said: Most of the third,</b> a poetic reference to the Jewish people (Isaiah 19:24), <b>has come in the water,</b> implying that Rava was equal in importance to the majority of the Jewish people. <b>Remember</b> then <b>and have mercy</b> on us. Although <b>we have strayed from you like an</b> unfaithful <b>woman</b> strays <b>from her husband, do not forsake</b> and punish <b>us like the sign of the bitter water,</b> with which a woman suspected of adultery is tested. That is to say, do not punish us with water. |
| Isaiah 20:1 | “Sargon” | Sanhedrin 94a:12 | The eight names of <b>Sennacherib</b> are <b>as it is written in his</b> regard among the kings of Assyria: <b>“Tiglath-Pileser”</b> (II Kings 15:29), <b>“</b>Tiglath-<b>Pilneser”</b> (II Chronicles 28:20), <b>“Shalmaneser”</b> (II Kings 17:3), <b>“Pul”</b> (II Kings 15:19), <b>“Sargon”</b> (Isaiah 20:1), and <b>“the great and noble Asenappar”</b> (Ezra 4:10). And the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> an additional name, <b>Sennacherib [<i>Sanḥeriv</i>]?</b> The Gemara explains: That was not a given name; rather, it is an appellation based on the fact <b>that his speech is contentious [<i>siḥato riv</i>],</b> leading to quarrel and shame. <b>Alternatively,</b> he was called Sanḥeriv due to the fact <b>that he spoke [<i>saḥ</i>] and snorted out [<i>niḥer</i>]</b> contemptuous <b>statements vis-à-vis the Transcendent.</b> |
| Isaiah 20:2 | “Go and loose the sackcloth from your loins, and remove your shoe from your foot” | Yoma 77a:12 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> We learn it <b>from here,</b> as it states: <b>“Go and loose the sackcloth from your loins, and remove your shoe from your foot”</b> (Isaiah 20:2). <b>And it is written: “And he did so, walking naked and barefoot”</b> (Isaiah 20:2). <b>Barefoot</b> implies a lack <b>of what? Is it not</b> a lack of <b>wearing shoes?</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that perhaps the meaning of barefoot is that Isaiah walked <b>with patched shoes. Because if you do not say this,</b> but you claim that the verse is to be understood literally, does “naked” mean <b>actually naked? Rather,</b> the meaning is that Isaiah walked in <b>ragged garments. Here too,</b> the meaning is that he walked <b>in patched shoes.</b> |
| Isaiah 20:3 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That which is written: “As My servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot | Shabbat 114a:4 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That which is written: “As My servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot</b> for three years” (Isaiah 20:3), is not to be understood literally. Rather, <b>naked</b> means that he wore <b>tattered clothing, and barefoot</b> means that he walked <b>with patched shoes.</b> |
| Isaiah 21:3 | in a man? But isn’t it written: “Pangs [ tzirim ] have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail” | Bekhorot 45a:21 | <b>Abaye said to him: And are there no</b> hinges <b>in a man? But isn’t it written: “Pangs [<i>tzirim</i>] have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail”</b> (Isaiah 21:3)? The Gemara responds: The verse is referring specifically to <b>hinges of flesh,</b> which are not considered limbs, as they contain no bones. The Gemara persists: <b>But isn’t it written: “My lord, by reason of the vision my pains [<i>tzirai</i>] come”</b> (Daniel 10:16)? The Gemara responds: <b>Here too,</b> the verse is referring to <b>hinges of flesh.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that the hinges of a male are only of flesh, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> then as far as the <b>248</b> limbs that the Sages stated constitute a human body, <b>how can you find</b> them? <b>Neither in a man nor in a woman.</b> |
| Isaiah 21:12 | Man, as it is written: “The watchman said: Morning has come, and also night; if you will inquire [ tivayun ], inquire [ be’ayu ]” | Bava Kamma3b:14 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the category of <b>Man, as it is written: “The watchman said: Morning has come, and also night; if you will inquire [<i>tivayun</i>], inquire [<i>be’ayu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 21:12). The terms “<i>tivayun</i>” and “<i>be’ayu</i>,” meaning inquire, refer to a person, who is able to inquire. Accordingly, <i>Maveh</i> relates to an action performed by a person. |
| Isaiah 21:14 | it is written: “To him who is thirsty bring water” | Taanit 7a:13 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “To him who is thirsty bring water”</b> (Isaiah 21:14), which indicates that the one who has water must bring it to the thirsty person, <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), from which it may be inferred that the thirsty person must seek out water himself. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa resolves this apparent contradiction by explaining that <b>if he is a worthy student</b> the teacher must seek him out, as in <b>“to him who is thirsty bring water,” but if</b> the student is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water,”</b> i.e., this student must seek out a teacher himself. |
| Isaiah 21:15 | said before Him: Master of the Universe, it is standing honed from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “For they have fled from the swords, | Sanhedrin 95b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> did the angel <b>strike them? Rabbi Eliezer says: He struck them by hand, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great hand”</b> (Exodus 14:31), where the term for hand, <i>yad</i>, is preceded by the definite article <i>ha</i>, indicating that this was <b>the hand that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He struck them with</b> His <b>finger, as it is stated: “And the sorcerers said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God”</b> (Exodus 8:15), <b>indicating</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>finger that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Gabriel:</b> Is <b>your scythe honed?</b> Gabriel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, it is standing honed from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “For they have fled from the swords,</b> from the honed sword” (Isaiah 21:15). |
| Isaiah 22:5 | a shouting over walls and a cry to the mountain” | Taanit 29a:17 | <b>And the prophet Isaiah lamented over them: “The burden of the Valley of Vision. What ails you now that you have all gone up to the roofs? You that were full of uproar, a tumultuous city, a joyous town, your slain are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle”</b> (Isaiah 22:1–2). This is referring to the young priests who died by throwing themselves off the roof into the fire. <b>And even with regard to the Holy One, Blessed be He, it is stated:</b> “For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling, and of confusion for the Lord of hosts, in the Valley of Vision; <b>a shouting over walls and a cry to the mountain”</b> (Isaiah 22:5). This verse indicates that even God shouts over the destruction of the Temple. |
| Isaiah 22:12 | which is written: “And in that day did the Lord, the God of hosts, call to weeping, and to lamentation, and to baldness | Avodah Zarah3b:9 | <b>Rav Aḥa said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: From the day the Temple was destroyed, there is no</b> longer any <b>making sport for the Holy One, Blessed be He. And from where do we</b> derive <b>that there is no making sport? If we say</b> that it is <b>from</b> that <b>which is written: “And in that day did the Lord, the God of hosts, call to weeping, and to lamentation, and to baldness</b> and to girding with sackcloth” (Isaiah 22:12), that is inconclusive: <b>Perhaps that day</b> alone was called for weeping and lamentation, <b>and no additional</b> days. |
| Isaiah 22:12 | in the outer chambers? Isn’t it written: “And on that day the Lord, the God of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth” | Chagigah 5b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t</b> God cry <b>in the outer chambers? Isn’t it written: “And on that day the Lord, the God of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth”</b> (Isaiah 22:12)? The Gemara responds: <b>The destruction of the Temple is different, as even the angels of peace cried, as it is stated: “Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the angels of peace weep bitterly”</b> (Isaiah 33:7). |
| Isaiah 22:13 | When the community is immersed in suffering, a person may not say: I will go to my home and I will eat and drink, and peace be upon you, my soul. And if he does so, the verse says about him: “And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die” | Taanit 11a:6 | A similar idea <b>is taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the community is immersed in suffering, a person may not say: I will go to my home and I will eat and drink, and peace be upon you, my soul. And if he does so, the verse says about him: “And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die”</b> (Isaiah 22:13). <b>And</b> the prophecy continues with <b>what is written afterward,</b> in the following verse: <b>“And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you until you die”</b> (Isaiah 22:14). |
| Isaiah 22:14 | “And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you until you die” | Taanit 11a:6 | A similar idea <b>is taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the community is immersed in suffering, a person may not say: I will go to my home and I will eat and drink, and peace be upon you, my soul.

| Isaiah 22:14 | as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts revealed Himself to my ears: This iniquity shall not be atoned for until you die” | Yoma 86a:8 | <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who has</b> caused <b>desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, his repentance has no power to suspend</b> punishment, <b>nor does Yom Kippur</b> have power <b>to atone</b> for his sin, <b>nor does suffering</b> alone have power <b>to absolve</b> him. <b>Rather, all these suspend</b> punishment, <b>and death absolves</b> him, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord of Hosts revealed Himself to my ears: This iniquity shall not be atoned for until you die”</b> (Isaiah 22:14). |
| Isaiah 22:15 | Rabbi Elazar says: Shebna was a hedonist. It is written here: “Go, get yourself to this steward [ hasokhen ], | Sanhedrin 26b:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Shebna was a hedonist.

| Isaiah 22:17 | “The Lord will dislocate you the dislocation of a man” | Ketubot 28a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the verse: <b>“The Lord will dislocate you the dislocation of a man”</b> (Isaiah 22:17), <b>and Rav said:</b> This indicates that <b>the dislocation of a man is more difficult</b> for him <b>than</b> the dislocation of <b>a woman</b> is for her. Therefore, the woman is ousted. |
| Isaiah 22:18 | “He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into a large country; | Sanhedrin 26a:27 | The Gemara continues to interpret the prophecy about Shebna: <b>“He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into a large country;</b> there you shall die, and there shall be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord’s house” (Isaiah 22:18). A <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: He,</b> Shebna, <b>desired shame for his master’s house; therefore his glory turned to shame.</b> This is what happened to him: <b>When he was going out</b> of the gate of Jerusalem to submit to the Assyrians, the angel <b>Gabriel came</b> and <b>held the gate in front of his camp</b> so they could not follow him. Consequently, he went out by himself. |
| Isaiah 23:8 | from here: “Whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers [ kinaneha ] are the honorable of the earth” | Bava Batra75a:5 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the remainder</b> of the leviathan, they will <b>divide it and use it for commerce in the markets of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “They will part him among the <i>kena’anim</i>”</b> (Job 40:30). <b>And <i>kena’anim</i></b> means <b>nothing other than merchants, as it is stated: “As for the merchant [<i>kena’an</i>], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves to oppress”</b> (Hosea 12:8). <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “Whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers [<i>kinaneha</i>] are the honorable of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 23:8). |
| Isaiah 23:8 | “Whose traders are princes, whose merchants [ kinaneha ] are the honorable of the earth” | Pesachim 50a:15 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that a merchant can be called a <i>kena’ani</i>? As it is written: “And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain <i>kena’ani</i>…</b>and he took her, and went in unto her” (Genesis 38:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>kena’ani</i></b> in this context? <b>If you say</b> it refers to <b>an actual Canaanite, is it possible that Abraham warned Isaac</b> not to marry a Canaanite woman, and <b>Isaac warned Jacob</b> to the same effect, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>Judah went and married</b> a Canaanite woman? <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> She was <b>the daughter of a merchant, as it is written: “As for the merchant [<i>kena’an</i>], the balances of deceit are in his hand.

| Isaiah 23:13 | Chaldeans, as it is written: “Behold the land of the Chaldeans, this is the people that was not” | Sukkah 52b:7 | <b>Rav Ḥana bar Aḥa said</b> that the Sages <b>in the school of Rav say:</b> There are <b>four</b> creations that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> created, yet He, as it were, <b>regrets that He created them,</b> as they do more harm than good. <b>And these are they: Exile, Chaldeans, and Ishmaelites, and the evil inclination. Exile, as it is written: “Now therefore, for what am I here, says the Lord, seeing that My people is taken away for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:5). God Himself is asking: For what am I here? <b>Chaldeans, as it is written: “Behold the land of the Chaldeans, this is the people that was not”</b> (Isaiah 23:13), meaning, if only they never were. |
| Isaiah 23:15 | seventy years, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king” | Sanhedrin 99a:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The messianic era will be forty years</b> long, <b>as it is stated: “Forty years will I strive with the generation”</b> (Psalms 95:10).

| Isaiah 24:2 | as it is stated: “And the common people were like the priest, | Shabbat 119b:8 | <b>Rav Hamnuna said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because schoolchildren there were interrupted</b> from studying Torah, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And I am filled with the wrath of God, I cannot contain it, <b>pour it onto the infants in the street</b> and onto the gathering of youths together, for men and women alike will be captured, the elderly along with those of advanced years” (Jeremiah 6:11).

| Isaiah 24:9 | as it is stated: “With song they shall not drink wine” | Sotah 48a:12 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna continues with the list of items that were nullified. <b>From</b> the time <b>when the Sanhedrin ceased song was</b> also <b>nullified from the places of feasts,</b> i.e., it was no longer permitted to sing at a feast where wine was served, <b>as it is stated: “With song they shall not drink wine”</b> (Isaiah 24:9). |
| Isaiah 24:9 | that | Sotah 48a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question with regard to the first clause of the mishna: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the verse: “With song they shall not drink wine” (Isaiah 24:9) <b>is written</b> about the period <b>from</b> the time <b>when the Sanhedrin was nullified? Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> From <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “The Elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music”</b> (Lamentations 5:14). This indicates that the dissolution of the Sanhedrin, who are the Elders from the gate, is linked to the end of the young men singing. |
| Isaiah 24:12 | and the gate is stricken unto ruin” | Bava Kamma21a:7 | <b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent because it is stated:</b> “Desolation remains in the city, <b>and the gate is stricken unto ruin”</b> (Isaiah 24:12), i.e., a house that is not lived in will collapse at some point due to neglect. Consequently, one who lives inside an otherwise uninhabited house is providing a service to the homeowner, as he maintains the house and prevents it from falling apart. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I saw this</b> ruin <b>and it gores like an ox,</b> i.e., it is devastating. <b>Rav Yosef stated</b> a similar idea: <b>A home that is lived in is settled</b> and safeguarded, while a home that is not lived in has no one to look after it and maintain it. |
| Isaiah 24:12 | and the gate is smitten unto ruin” | Bava Kamma97a:3 | The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted, there,</b> in the case of a courtyard, <b>whether</b> the reasoning for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>according to the one who says: An inhabited house</b> remains <b>habitable,</b> and it is therefore <b>satisfactory for</b> the owner of the property to have someone residing in his courtyard, or <b>whether</b> the reasoning is <b>according to the one who says</b> that since the verse states: “In the city is left desolation, <b>and the gate is smitten unto ruin”</b> (Isaiah 24:12), which indicates that a desolate house will fall into ruin but an inhabited house will be maintained, either way it is satisfactory <b>for</b> the owner that one stay in his courtyard. Consequently, the one who resides there need not pay rent. |
| Isaiah 24:12 | and the gate is smitten unto ruin [ she’iyya ]” | Sotah 48a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>For its cedar work shall be its city?</b> Furthermore, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> wondered when he <b>said: Is a house interlaced with cedars</b> not as strong as <b>a city,</b> and therefore not threatened by desolation? <b>Rather,</b> it means that <b>even a house interlaced with cedars will become unstable [<i>mitroe’a</i>]</b> if song is heard there. <b>Rav Ashi said: Learn from it that when the destruction starts</b> it <b>starts with the threshold, as it is stated: “Desolation shall be in the posts.” And if you wish, say</b> instead that they derive this idea <b>from here:</b> “In the city is left desolation, <b>and the gate is smitten unto ruin [<i>she’iyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 24:12). The term “ruin” here is referring to the destructive demon known as <i>She’iyya</i>, who strikes the gate first. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I saw it,</b> this <i>She’iyya</i>, <b>and it was goring</b> and wreaking havoc <b>like an ox.</b> |
| Isaiah 24:14 | from here: “Those yonder lift up their voice, they sing for joy; for the majesty of the Lord they shout from the sea” | Arakhin 11a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the requirement to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here:</b> “Sing aloud to God…<b>Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel, the sweet harp with the lyre”</b> (Psalms 81:2–3). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the obligation is derived <b>from here: “Those yonder lift up their voice, they sing for joy; for the majesty of the Lord they shout from the sea”</b> (Isaiah 24:14). |
| Isaiah 24:16 | has not opened again, as it is stated: “From the corner of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous” | Sanhedrin 37b:11 | <b>And Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: From the day the earth opened its mouth and received the blood of Abel,</b> its mouth <b>has not opened again, as it is stated: “From the corner of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous”</b> (Isaiah 24:16): One can infer that the songs are heard <b>“from the corner of the earth,” but not from the mouth of the earth,</b> as the earth never again opened its mouth. <b>Ḥizkiyya,</b> Rav Yehuda’s <b>brother, raised an objection to</b> Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The verse states concerning Korah and his assembly: <b>“And the earth opened her mouth</b> and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods” (Numbers 16:32). Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>said to him:</b> It <b>opened</b> again <b>for a deleterious</b> purpose; it <b>did not open</b> again <b>for a constructive</b> purpose. |
| Isaiah 24:16 | began and recited a song before Him, as it is stated: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous. | Sanhedrin 94a:6 | <b>Immediately, the earth began and stated before Him: Master of the Universe, I</b> will <b>recite song before You in place of that righteous person,</b> i.e., Hezekiah, <b>and designate him</b> as the <b>Messiah.</b> The earth <b>began and recited a song before Him, as it is stated: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous.</b> But I said, my secret is mine, my secret is mine, woe unto me. The treacherous deal treacherously; the treacherous deal very treacherously” (Isaiah 24:16). |
| Isaiah 24:16 | A Divine Voice emerged and said: “The treacherous deal treacherously; the treacherous deal very treacherously” | Sanhedrin 94a:7 | <b>The angel</b> appointed to oversee <b>the world said before Him: Master of the Universe, perform the will of this righteous</b> person. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: “My secret is Mine, My secret is Mine”;</b> this matter will remain secret, as I am not yet bringing the redemption. <b>The prophet said: “Woe unto me,” woe unto me; until when</b> will the exile continue? <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: “The treacherous deal treacherously; the treacherous deal very treacherously”</b> (Isaiah 24:16). <b>And Rava, and some say Rabbi Yitzḥak, says: Until looters and looters of looters come,</b> the Messiah will not come. |
| Isaiah 24:16 | until the earth began and recited a song, as it is stated: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous” | Sanhedrin 94a:9 | <b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Pappeyas: It is a disgrace for Hezekiah and his associates that they did not recite a song</b> themselves and that a song was not recited <b>until the earth began and recited a song, as it is stated: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous”</b> (Isaiah 24:16). <b>On a similar note, you say: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who has delivered you</b> out of the hand of Egypt and out of the hand of Pharaoh” (Exodus 18:10). <b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Pappeyas: It is a disgrace for Moses and the six hundred thousand</b> adult men of the children of Israel whom he led out of Egypt <b>that they did not say: Blessed, until Yitro came and said: “Blessed be the Lord.”</b> |
| Isaiah 24:23 | as it is stated: “Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed” | Avodah Zarah17a:14 | <b>He said: Sun and moon, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed”</b> (Isaiah 24:23). <b>He said: Stars and constellations, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “And all the hosts of heaven shall molder away”</b> (Isaiah 34:4). |
| Isaiah 24:23 | “And before His Elders will be His glory” | Bava Batra10b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked</b> King <b>Solomon: Who is one</b> who is destined <b>for the World-to-Come?</b> King Solomon <b>said to them: All</b> those about whom it is stated: <b>“And before His Elders will be His glory”</b> (Isaiah 24:23), referring to those who are honored in this world due to their wisdom. This is <b>like</b> the incident involving <b>Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, who became ill</b> and <b>fainted.</b> When he returned to good health, <b>his father said to him: What did you see</b> when you were not conscious?

Rabbi Yehoshua further asked him: <b>And how did you see us,</b> the Torah scholars, there? Yosef <b>said to him: Just as we are important here, we are important there.</b> |
| Isaiah 24:23 | only once the vow has taken effect, as it is written: “And the moon shall be confounded [ ḥafera ]” | Nedarim 90a:2 | <b>And Rav Pappi said</b> with regard to this issue: The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis is <b>with regard to nullification</b> only, <b>as Rabbi Natan holds</b> that <b>a husband can nullify</b> a vow <b>only once the vow has taken effect, as it is written: “And the moon shall be confounded [<i>ḥafera</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 24:23). He employs this phrase as an allusion, interpreting the word <i>ḥafera</i> as if it were <i>hafara</i>, nullification, and concludes from here that only a vow that already exists, like the moon, can be nullified. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a husband can nullify</b> a vow <b>even though the vow has not</b> yet <b>taken effect, as it is written: “He nullifies the thoughts of the crafty”</b> (Job 5:12), implying that nullification pertains even to thoughts, to prevent them from going into effect. |
| Isaiah 24:23 | it is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, | Pesachim 68a:16 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raised a contradiction</b> between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed,</b> when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders will be His glory” (Isaiah 24:23), which indicates that in the future there will be no light at all from the sun or the moon. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days,</b> on the day that the Lord binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound blow” (Isaiah 30:26), which indicates that the light of the sun and moon will be even brighter than before. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where it says that the sun and the moon will be ashamed before the glow of the Divine Presence, it is referring <b>to the World</b>-<b>to</b>-<b>Come,</b> which is an entirely different world; while <b>there,</b> where it says that their light will increase, it is referring <b>to the days of the Messiah.</b> |
| Isaiah 24:23 | Rav Ḥisda raises a contradiction. It is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts will reign | Sanhedrin 91b:10 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raises a contradiction. It is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts will reign</b> in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be His glory” (Isaiah 24:23), indicating that the sun and the moon will no longer shine at the end of days. <b>And it is written: “And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days”</b> (Isaiah 30:26), indicating that the sun and the moon will exist then and they will shine more brightly. The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult.</b> The verse <b>here,</b> in Isaiah chapter 30, is written with regard <b>to the days of the Messiah,</b> when the sun and moon will shine more brightly; the verse <b>there,</b> in Isaiah chapter 24, is written with regard <b>to the World-to-Come,</b> when the only light will be the light of God. |
| Isaiah 24:23 | spies, their intention was only to shame Eretz Yisrael. It is written here: “That they may search [ veyaḥperu ] the land for us,” and it is written there: “Then the moon will be embarrassed [ veḥafera ], and the sun will be ashamed” | Sotah 34b:4 | The Torah relates that the people asked Moses to send spies so <b>“that they may search the land for us”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:22). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says:</b> When the Jewish people asked to send <b>spies, their intention was only to shame Eretz Yisrael.

| Isaiah 25:8 | states: “He will destroy death forever; and the Lord, God, will wipe away tears from off all faces | Moed Katan28b:4 | In order to conclude on a positive note, the mishna says: <b>But with regard to the future,</b> the verse <b>states: “He will destroy death forever; and the Lord, God, will wipe away tears from off all faces</b> and the reproach of His people He will take away from off all the earth” (Isaiah 25:8). |
| Isaiah 25:8 | it is written: “He will destroy death forever, | Pesachim 68a:15 | As we have been discussing the world of the future and the resurrection of the dead, the Gemara cites additional statements on these topics. <b>Ulla raised a contradiction</b> between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “He will destroy death forever,</b> and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the insult of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 25:8). <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written:</b> “There shall be no more there an infant who lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; <b>for the youngest shall die a hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20), implying that people will live long lives, but death will not be totally eradicated. Ulla answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring to <b>Jews,</b> who will not die at all, while <b>there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring to <b>gentiles,</b> who will live exceedingly long lives but eventually die. The Gemara asks: <b>What are gentiles doing there</b> in the future world? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vineyard workers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 25:8 | will wipe tears from all faces” | Sanhedrin 91b:9 | <b>Ulla raises a contradiction. It is written: “He will swallow death forever; and the Lord</b> God <b>will wipe tears from all faces”</b> (Isaiah 25:8), indicating that death will no longer exist at the end of days. <b>And it is written: “There shall be no more an infant a few days old then…for the youngest shall die one hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20). The Gemara answers that this contradiction is <b>not difficult.</b> The verse <b>here,</b> in Isaiah chapter 25, is written <b>with regard to the Jewish people,</b> who will live forever after resurrection; the verse <b>there,</b> in Isaiah chapter 65, is written <b>with regard to gentiles,</b> who will ultimately die after an extremely long life. The Gemara asks: <b>And what do gentiles seek,</b> i.e., why will they merit to live, in <b>that</b> era? The Gemara answers that the verse is referring to <b>those</b> gentiles <b>about whom it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and vinedressers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 25:9 | with his finger, as it is stated: “And it shall be said on that day: Behold, this is our God, for whom we waited, that He might save us. This is the Lord; for whom we waited. We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation” | Taanit 31a:9 | The tractate concludes with a statement related to the topic of dancing. <b>Ulla</b> of the city of <b>Bira’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will arrange a dance of the righteous, and He</b> will <b>be sitting among them in</b> the <b>Garden of Eden, and each and every one</b> of the righteous will <b>point</b> to God <b>with his finger, as it is stated: “And it shall be said on that day: Behold, this is our God, for whom we waited, that He might save us. This is the Lord; for whom we waited. We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation”</b> (Isaiah 25:9). God will be revealed, so that every righteous individual will be able to say: This is our God, as though they were pointing at Him with a finger. |
| Isaiah 26:2 | will say amen, as it is stated: “Open the gates, so that the righteous nation that keeps faithfulness may enter” | Sanhedrin 110b:14 | It is <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: From the moment that</b> the child <b>will say amen, as it is stated: “Open the gates, so that the righteous nation that keeps faithfulness may enter”</b> (Isaiah 26:2). <b>Do not read</b> the verse as <b>“that keeps faithfulness [<i>shomer emunim</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>That says amen [<i>she’omer amen</i>].</b> From the moment he says amen, the gates to the World-to-Come open. |
| Isaiah 26:2 | Reish Lakish said: One who answers amen with all his strength, they open the gates of the Garden of Eden before him, as it is stated: “Open the gates, and a righteous nation shall come who keeps the faith” | Shabbat 119b:5 | Apropos the reward for honoring Shabbat, the Gemara cites statements about the reward for answering amen. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>anyone who answers: Amen, may His great name be blessed,</b> wholeheartedly, <b>with all his might,</b> they <b>rip his sentence, as it is stated: “When punishments are annulled in Israel, when the people offer themselves, bless the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:2). <b>What is the reason for when punishments are annulled? Because</b> the Jewish people <b>blessed God.</b> When one recites: Amen, may His great name be blessed, and blesses God, his punishment is annulled. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>one has within him a trace of idolatry,</b> when he answers amen <b>he is forgiven. It is written here,</b> in the verse above: <b>“When punishments [<i>pera’ot</i>] are annulled.” And it is written there,</b> with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: “And Moses saw <b>that</b> the nation <b>was wild [<i>paru’a</i>],</b> for Aaron had let them loose for anyone who might rise against them” (Exodus 32:25). Even one with the wildness of idolatry is forgiven. <b>Reish Lakish said: One who answers amen with all his strength, they open the gates of the Garden of Eden before him, as it is stated: “Open the gates, and a righteous nation shall come who keeps the faith”</b> (Isaiah 26:2). <b>Do not read: Who keeps [<i>shomer</i>] the faith [<i>emunim</i>], but rather: Who say [<i>she’omerim</i>] amen.

| Isaiah 26:4 | which is written: “Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord [ beYah ] is God, an everlasting [ olamim ] Rock” | Menachot 29b:7 | Rava explains: <b>They would put a hump-like stroke on the roof of</b> the letter <b><i>ḥet</i> as if to</b> thereby <b>say:</b> The Holy One, Blessed be <b>He, lives [<i>ḥai</i>] in the heights of the universe. And they would suspend the</b> left <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>, as Rabbi Yehuda Nesia asked Rabbi Ami: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord [<i>beYah</i>] is God, an everlasting [<i>olamim</i>] Rock”</b> (Isaiah 26:4)? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: Anyone who puts their trust in the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will have Him as <b>his refuge in this world and in the World-to-Come.</b> This is alluded to in the word “<i>olamim</i>,” which can also mean: Worlds. |
| Isaiah 26:5 | as it is stated: “For He has brought down those who dwell high, the lofty city laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it to the dust” | Rosh Hashanah31b:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> There are <b>six exiles,</b> if you count only the places, not the number of journeys, and a different verse alludes to this, <b>as it is stated: “For He has brought down those who dwell high, the lofty city laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it to the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:5). This verse mentions six expressions of lowering: Brought down, laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it, and to the dust. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And from there,</b> i.e., from their lowest place of descent, <b>they are destined to be redeemed</b> in the future, <b>as it is stated: “Shake yourself from the dust, arise, sit,</b> Jerusalem” (Isaiah 52:2). |
| Isaiah 26:6 | legs. And so it says: “The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps [ pa’amei ] of the needy” | Chagigah 3a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the term <b>“<i>regalim</i>” is necessary</b> to <b>exclude people with artificial legs.</b> Although these people are capable of walking, as they do not have two natural legs they are exempt from ascending to the Temple. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from:</b> “Three <b>occasions [<i>pe’amim</i>]</b> in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). The term <i>pe’amim</i> can also mean legs, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the term <b>“<i>pe’amim</i>”: <i>Pe’amim</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>legs. And so it says: “The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps [<i>pa’amei</i>] of the needy”</b> (Isaiah 26:6), <b>and it says: “How beautiful are your feet [<i>fe’amayikh</i>] in sandals, daughter of the prince”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2). |
| Isaiah 26:10 | which is written: “Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; | Megillah 6a:18 | § Having mentioned Edom, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness;</b> in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord” (Isaiah 26:10)? <b>Isaac said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let favor be shown to Esau,</b> my beloved son. God <b>said to him:</b> Esau <b>is wicked.</b> Isaac <b>said to</b> God: <b>“Yet will he not learn righteousness,”</b> i.e., is there no one who can find merit in him? God <b>said to him: “In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,”</b> meaning that he is destined to destroy Eretz Yisrael. Isaac <b>said to</b> God: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that he is that wicked, <b>“he will not behold the majesty of the Lord.”</b> |
| Isaiah 26:12 | a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [ tishpot ] peace for us” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Isaiah 26:14 | as it is stated: “The dead live not” | Ketubot 111b:4 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The common, uneducated people</b> will <b>not</b> come <b>alive</b> in the future, <b>as it is stated: “The dead live not”</b> (Isaiah 26:14). In other words, those who were already considered dead in their lifetimes will not come back to life afterward either. <b>This</b> idea <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The dead live not”;</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this is referring <b>to everyone,</b> i.e., none of the dead will live again. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The shades [<i>refa’im</i>] rise not”</b> (Isaiah 26:14). This teaches that <b>the verse is speaking of one who weakens [<i>merapeh</i>] himself from matters of Torah.</b> |
| Isaiah 26:14 | “And you have caused all their memory to perish” | Sanhedrin 110b:11 | <b>But everyone agrees</b> that <b>the minor children of the wicked of the nations of the world will not come into the World-to-Come,</b> as they have no virtue at all. <b>And Rabban Gamliel derives</b> this matter concerning those children <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And you have caused all their memory to perish”</b> (Isaiah 26:14). |
| Isaiah 26:18 | an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind” | Niddah 8b:20 | <b>And even though there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for</b> this <b>matter,</b> that even a pregnancy that ends in a miscarriage is like a full-fledged pregnancy, there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind”</b> (Isaiah 26:18). This verse indicates that even one who miscarries wind is considered as having been with child. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that this is called a mere <b>allusion to the matter?</b> This explicit verse <b>is a significant proof.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When that verse was written,</b> it was <b>written with regard to males</b> as bearing children. The allusion to child-bearing in the verse is symbolic, so halakhic inferences may not be drawn from it. |
| Isaiah 26:19 | “Your dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise” | Ketubot 111a:17 | <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection</b> from a different verse: <b>“Your dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the phrase <b>“Your dead shall live”</b> is referring to <b>the dead of Eretz Yisrael,</b> whereas the subsequent phrase <b>“My dead bodies shall arise”</b> is referring to <b>the dead of</b> the lands <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>And</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the verse <b>“And I will set glory [<i>tzvi</i>] in the land of the living”?</b> This verse <b>is written</b> with regard <b>to Nebuchadnezzar, as the Merciful One states: I will bring upon you a king who is as swift as a deer [<i>tzvi</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 26:19 | a different verse, as it is written: “For Your dew is as the dew of light, and the earth shall bring to life the shades” | Ketubot 111b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>Their master,</b> i.e. God, <b>is not pleased that you say this of</b> ordinary Jews. Rather, <b>that</b> verse <b>is written about one who weakens himself</b> and succumbs <b>to idol worship.</b> Those who commit this great sin do not merit to be resurrected in the future. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: I teach</b> it from <b>a different verse, as it is written: “For Your dew is as the dew of light, and the earth shall bring to life the shades”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). Rabbi Elazar explains: <b>Anyone who uses the light of Torah,</b> which is called the dew of light, <b>the light of Torah</b> will <b>revive him; and anyone who does not use the light of Torah, the light of Torah</b> will <b>not revive him.</b> |
| Isaiah 26:19 | as it is written: “Your dead shall live, my corpse shall arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in the dust, for your dew is as the dew of vegetation, and the land shall cast out the dead” | Sanhedrin 90b:10 | The proof <b>from the Prophets</b> is <b>as it is written: “Your dead shall live, my corpse shall arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in the dust, for your dew is as the dew of vegetation, and the land shall cast out the dead”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). The heretics said to him: <b>But perhaps</b> the prophecy was fulfilled with <b>the dead that Ezekiel revived.</b> No proof may be cited from that verse with regard to any future resurrection. |
| Isaiah 26:19 | as it is stated: “Awake and sing for joy, you who dwell in the dust” | Sotah 5a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> also <b>says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, his dust,</b> i.e., his remains in his grave, <b>will not stir</b> at the time of the resurrection of the dead, <b>as it is stated: “Awake and sing for joy, you who dwell in the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). <b>It is not stated: You who lie in the dust,</b> which would indicate that all the dead will be awakened in the future, <b>but rather: “You who dwell in the dust,”</b> indicating that only <b>one who became a neighbor to the dust in his lifetime</b> by living with extreme humility will stir at the time of the resurrection. |
| Isaiah 26:20 | from here: “Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes” | Avodah Zarah4b:6 | The Gemara further discusses this matter: <b>And how</b> long does <b>His indignation</b> last? It lasts <b>a moment. And how</b> long is <b>a moment? Ameimar, and some say Ravina, said:</b> It lasts <b>as</b> long as it takes <b>to say</b> the word <b>moment [<i>rega</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> God’s <b>anger</b> lasts for only <b>a moment? As it is written: “His anger is but for a moment; His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Isaiah 26:20 | “Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; | Bava Kamma60b:2 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>plague in the city, gather your feet,</b> i.e., limit the time you spend out of the house, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning.” And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you;</b> hide yourself for a little moment, until the anger has passed by” (Isaiah 26:20). <b>And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:25). |
| Isaiah 26:20 | “Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes” | Berakhot 7a:15 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that God <b>is</b> only <b>angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead, <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Isaiah 26:20 | “Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you; hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes” | Sanhedrin 105b:8 | <b>If you wish, say</b> instead this proof from another source, as it is stated: <b>“Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you; hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. And <b>when is</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>angry?</b> It is <b>during the first three hours</b> of the day, <b>when the crest of the rooster is white</b> from the sun. The Gemara challenges: <b>Each and every hour</b> of the day the rooster’s crest <b>is also white,</b> as it does not always remain red. The Gemara explains: The difference is that during <b>each and every</b> other <b>hour</b> when the rooster stands that way, <b>there are red streaks in</b> his crest. But <b>at that moment</b> when God is angry, <b>there are no red streaks in</b> the rooster’s crest. |
| Isaiah 26:20 | “Come, my people, enter into your chambers, | Sanhedrin 25b:24 | The Gemara relates a story about a tax collector: <b>The father of Rabbi Zeira collected</b> taxes for <b>thirteen years. When the head</b> tax collector of the <b>river</b> region <b>would come to the city,</b> Rabbi Zeira’s father would prepare the residents ahead of time. <b>When he would see the rabbis, he would say to them</b> as a hint: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers,</b> and shut your doors behind you; hide yourself for a little moment until the indignation has passed” (Isaiah 26:20). He said this so that the head tax collector would not see the rabbis, and it would be possible to lower the taxes of the city. <b>When he would see</b> the ordinary <b>people of the city, he would say</b> to them: Beware, as <b>the head</b> tax collector of the <b>river</b> region <b>is coming to the city, and will now slaughter the father,</b> i.e., take one’s money, <b>before the son, and the son before the father.</b> |
| Isaiah 27:1 | sword | Bava Batra74b:5 | The verse states: <b>“And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21). <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> this as a reference to the <b>sea oryx. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent, as it is stated: “In that day the Lord with His sore</b> and great and strong <b>sword</b> will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent” (Isaiah 27:1). |
| Isaiah 27:1 | for the righteous in the future. As it is stated: “And He will slay the serpent that is in the sea” | Bava Batra74b:6 | § The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following statements of Rav Yehuda citing Rav: <b>Everything; time; Jordan. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He created male and female. Even leviathan the slant serpent and leviathan the tortuous serpent He created male and female. And if they would have coupled</b> and produced offspring, they would have <b>destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and killed the female, and salted</b> the female to preserve it for the banquet <b>for the righteous in the future. As it is stated: “And He will slay the serpent that is in the sea”</b> (Isaiah 27:1). |
| Isaiah 27:4 | It is written: “Fury is not in Me” | Avodah Zarah4a:5 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raises a contradiction</b> between the following verses. <b>It is written: “Fury is not in Me”</b> (Isaiah 27:4), <b>and it is written: “The Lord is a jealous and furious God”</b> (Nahum 1:2). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> where it states that God has no fury, it is speaking <b>with regard to the Jewish people,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> where it says that God has fury, it is speaking <b>with regard to the nations of the world. Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says</b> in explanation of the verse: “Fury is not in Me; would that I were as the briers and thorns in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether” (Isaiah 27:4). <b>“Fury is not in Me,” as I have already taken an oath</b> that I will not destroy the Jewish people; <b>“would that I” had not taken this oath,</b> since then <b>I would be</b> active <b>“as the briers and thorns</b> in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether.” |
| Isaiah 27:4 | Ḥeima, as it is stated: “Wrath is not in me” | Nedarim 32a:4 | <b>At that moment, Moses our teacher wanted to kill them, as it is stated: “Cease from anger [<i>af</i> ] and forsake wrath [<i>ḥeima</i>]”</b> (Psalms 37:8), which indicates that he wanted to harm them. <b>And there are those who say: He killed</b> the angel named <b>Ḥeima, as it is stated: “Wrath is not in me”</b> (Isaiah 27:4). The Gemara asks: How is it possible to say that he killed Ḥeima? <b>Isn’t it written</b> that Moses himself said much later: <b>“For I was in dread of the anger and wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19)? The Gemara answers: <b>There are two</b> types of <b>wrath. And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the army of Ḥeima</b> remained but not the angel itself. |
| Isaiah 27:5 | entourage below, as it is stated: “Or let him take hold of My stronghold [ ma’uzi ], that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me” | Sanhedrin 99b:10 | § Apropos the significance of Torah study, <b>Rabbi Alexandri says: Anyone who engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah for its own sake introduces peace into the</b> heavenly <b>entourage above and into the</b> earthly <b>entourage below, as it is stated: “Or let him take hold of My stronghold [<i>ma’uzi</i>], that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me”</b> (Isaiah 27:5). One who observes the Torah, which is called <i>oz</i>, introduces peace, even before the presence of God, as it were. |
| Isaiah 27:6 | to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom” | Shabbat 145b:15 | <b>For what</b> reason are <b>the Torah scholars in Babylonia distinguished</b> by special garb? <b>Because they are not native to that place</b> and therefore require special dress to distinguish themselves, <b>as people say</b> in the folk expression: <b>In</b> my own <b>city,</b> I am honored for <b>my name; in</b> a place that is <b>not</b> my own <b>city,</b> I am honored for <b>my clothing.</b> The Gemara then praised the Sages of Babylonia by interpreting the verse “In days <b>to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom”</b> (Isaiah 27:6). <b>Rav Yosef taught: These are the Torah scholars in Babylonia, who add buds and blossoms to the Torah.</b> |
| Isaiah 27:8 | as it is written: “In full measure [ besasse’a ] when You send her away do You contend with her” | Sanhedrin 100a:17 | In a related matter, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: In accordance with the measure that a person metes</b> out for others the heavenly court <b>metes</b> out <b>for him,</b> i.e., the response is commensurate with the action, <b>as it is written: “In full measure [<i>besasse’a</i>] when You send her away do You contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8). The term <i>besasse’a</i> is interpreted as <i>bese’a se’a</i>, meaning that one receives a measure [<i>se’a</i>] commensurate with the measure [<i>bese’a</i>] that he meted out. |
| Isaiah 27:8 | as it is stated: “In full measure [ besase’a ], when You send her away You contend with her” | Shabbat 105b:10 | Apropos the laws of mourning for an upright person and a Torah scholar, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: Anyone who sheds tears over an upright person, the Holy One, Blessed be He, counts</b> his tears <b>and places them in His treasury, as it is stated: “You have counted my wanderings, put my tears into your bottle, are they not in your book?”</b> (Psalms 56:9). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who is lazy in eulogizing a</b> Torah <b>scholar, it is fitting to bury him alive, as it is stated: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat-seraḥ, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Ga’ash”</b> (Joshua 24:30). This <b>teaches that the mountain raged against them to kill them</b> because they did not eulogize him appropriately. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever is lazy in eulogizing a Sage does not live</b> a <b>long</b> life, and his punishment is <b>measure for measure.</b> Since he was unconcerned with the death of the Sage, in the heavens they will be unconcerned with his death. The Holy One, Blessed be He, conducts Himself in this manner, <b>as it is stated: “In full measure [<i>besase’a</i>], when You send her away You contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8), and the Sages derived that God punishes from the words: “You contend with her,” and He does so measure for measure, <i>se’a</i> for <i>se’a</i>, from the word <i>sase’a</i> in the verse above. |
| Isaiah 27:8 | that with the measure that a person measures, he is measured with it? As it is stated: “In full measure [ besase’a ], when you send her away, you contend with her” | Sotah 8b:15 | <b>It is taught</b> in a baraita in the <i>Tosefta</i> (3:1–5) that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that with the measure that a person measures, he is measured with it? As it is stated: “In full measure [<i>besase’a</i>], when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8). In other words, in the measure, <i>bese’a</i>, that one used in one’s sin, God will contend with, i.e., punish, him. |
| Isaiah 27:8 | king until his time to be banished, as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her” | Sotah 9a:10 | <b>Rather, if</b> anything <b>was stated</b> with regard to the delay of punishment, it <b>was stated like this: Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish</b> a sinful <b>king until his time to be banished, as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8). |
| Isaiah 27:8 | “in full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her” | Sotah 9a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And since he derives it from “for every boot stamped with fierceness,” why do I</b> need <b>“in full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8)? |
| Isaiah 27:8 | as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away, | Sotah 9a:7 | The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach the statement <b>as</b> taught <b>by Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, for Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a nation</b> deserving of punishment <b>until its time to be banished,</b> i.e., until the time of its final eradication from the world, <b>as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away,</b> you contend with her” (Isaiah 27:8). |
| Isaiah 27:9 | when he makes all the stones of the altar as limestones [ ke’avnei gir ] that are beaten into pieces, so that the asherim and the sun images shall rise no more” | Avodah Zarah54a:1 | <b>Ḥizkiyya said: What is the verse</b> from which this <i>halakha</i> is derived? It is derived from the verse: “By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated…<b>when he makes all the stones of the altar as limestones [<i>ke’avnei gir</i>] that are beaten into pieces, so that the <i>asherim</i> and the sun images shall rise no more”</b> (Isaiah 27:9). This indicates that <b>if</b> the description <b>“as limestones that are beaten into pieces” is</b> fulfilled, then the statement <b>“The <i>asherim</i> and the sun images shall rise no more”</b> also applies, and their status is revoked. <b>If</b> it is <b>not</b> fulfilled, then <b>they shall rise,</b> meaning that their status is not revoked. |
| Isaiah 27:11 | “When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come and set them on fire” | Bava Batra10b:13 | It is related that <b>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur,</b> king of Persia, <b>sent four hundred dinars to Rabbi Ami, but he did not accept them. She</b> then <b>sent them to Rava, and he accepted them for the sake of peace with the kingdom. Rabbi Ami heard</b> what Rava had done <b>and was angry. He said: Does</b> Rava <b>not accept</b> the lesson of the verse: <b>“When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come and set them on fire”</b> (Isaiah 27:11), meaning that when righteousness has ceased from a particular nation, it is time for its citizens to be punished, and therefore we should not help them perform any meritorious deeds, which would delay their punishment? The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Rava</b> accept the money? The Gemara answers: He did so <b>for the sake of peace with the kingdom.</b> |
| Isaiah 27:11 | anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them | Berakhot 33a:19 | <b>And Rav Ami said</b> in praise of knowledge: <b>Great is knowledge that was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated: “For God of knowledge is the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>And</b> since knowledge is regarded so highly, <b>anyone without knowledge, it is forbidden to have compassion upon him, as it is stated: “For they are a people of no wisdom, so their Creator will have no compassion upon them</b> and their Creator will not be gracious unto them” (Isaiah 27:11). If God shows no mercy for those who lack wisdom, all the more so should people refrain from doing so. |
| Isaiah 27:11 | any person in whom there is no knowledge, it is prohibited to have mercy upon him, as it is stated: “For it is a people of no understanding; therefore its Maker will have no mercy on them, and its Creator will show them no favor” | Sanhedrin 92a:12 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>any person in whom there is no knowledge, it is prohibited to have mercy upon him, as it is stated: “For it is a people of no understanding; therefore its Maker will have no mercy on them, and its Creator will show them no favor”</b> (Isaiah 27:11). If God has no mercy upon them, all the more so should people not show them mercy. |
| Isaiah 27:13 | rise early and recite: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great shofar shall be sounded; | Berakhot 56b:11 | <b>One who sees a <i>shofar</i> in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great <i>shofar</i> shall be sounded;</b> and they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt” (Isaiah 27:13), <b>before a different verse,</b> in which the <i>shofar</i> is a symbol of war, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Blow you the horn [<i>shofar</i>] in Giva”</b> (Hosea 5:8). |
| Isaiah 27:13 | and said: “And it shall be on that day the great shofar shall be sounded, | Makkot 24a:31 | <b>Moses said: “And you shall be lost among the nations”</b> (Leviticus 26:38). <b>Isaiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “And it shall be on that day the great shofar shall be sounded,</b> and those lost in the land of Assyria shall come” (Isaiah 27:13). |
| Isaiah 27:13 | on that day, that a great shofar shall be blown” | Rosh Hashanah11b:3 | It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In Nisan</b> our forefathers <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt, <b>as it is</b> explicitly stated in the Torah. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In Tishrei in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption. <b>This is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i></b> and another instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i>. It is written here,</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“Sound a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon”</b> (Psalms 81:4), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to the final redemption: “And it shall come to pass <b>on that day, that a great <i>shofar</i> shall be blown”</b> (Isaiah 27:13). |
| Isaiah 27:13 | come to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, | Sanhedrin 110b:8 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The members of the ten tribes <b>come to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded,</b> and they shall come who were lost in the land of Assyria and who were dispersed in the land of Egypt, and they shall worship the Lord at the holy mountain in Jerusalem” (Isaiah 27:13). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Here too, <b>Rabbi Akiva abandoned his piety</b> and uncharacteristically interpreted the verses harshly, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the ten tribes: <b>“Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return you faithless Israel, says the Lord; I will not frown upon you; for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not bear a grudge forever”</b> (Jeremiah 3:12). The prophet prophesies about the return of the ten tribes to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Isaiah 28:5 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will be a crown on the head of each and every righteous man. As it is stated: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, | Megillah 15b:3 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will be a crown on the head of each and every righteous man. As it is stated: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory,</b> and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of His people” (Isaiah 28:5). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“for a crown of glory [<i>tzevi</i>], and for a diadem [<i>velitzefirat</i>] of beauty”?</b> A crown <b>for those that do His will [<i>tzivyono</i>] and</b> a diadem <b>for those that await [<i>velamtzapin</i>] His glory.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this extends <b>to all</b> such individuals. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the residue of his people,” to whoever regards himself as a remainder,</b> i.e., small and unimportant like residue. But whoever holds himself in high esteem will not merit this. |
| Isaiah 28:5 | as it is stated: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the remnant of His people” | Sanhedrin 111b:3 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to be a crown on the head of each and every righteous</b> person, <b>as it is stated: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the remnant of His people”</b> (Isaiah 28:5). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“For a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty”?</b> It means: A crown <b>for those who perform His will and</b> a diadem <b>for those who await His salvation.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this extends <b>to everyone</b> in those categories. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Unto the remnant of His people,”</b> meaning that God will be a crown and a diadem <b>to one who</b> humbly <b>establishes himself like a remnant,</b> and does not conduct himself with self-importance. |
| Isaiah 28:6 | “And for a spirit of justice to him that sits in judgment and for strength to them who retaliate in battle to the gate” | Sanhedrin 111b:4 | The Gemara interprets a verse in Isaiah. <b>“And for a spirit of justice to him that sits in judgment and for strength to them who retaliate in battle to the gate”</b> (Isaiah 28:6). <b>“And for a spirit of justice”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who subdues his</b> evil <b>inclination</b> and prevents himself from sinning. <b>“To him that sits in judgment”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who judges a true judgment truthfully. “And for strength”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who overcomes his</b> evil <b>inclination. “Them who retaliate in battle”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who gives and takes</b> and engages <b>in the battle,</b> i.e., in the discourse <b>of Torah. “To the gate”</b> is referring to <b>those</b> Torah scholars <b>who arrive early and remain late within</b> the gates of <b>synagogues and study halls.</b> |
| Isaiah 28:7 | they stumble [ paku ] in judgment [ peliliyya ]” | Megillah 15b:6 | The Attribute of Justice <b>said to Him: “These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink;</b> the priest and the prophet reel through strong drink, they are confused because of wine, they stagger because of strong drink; they reel in vision, <b>they stumble [<i>paku</i>] in judgment [<i>peliliyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:7). The word <b><i>paku</i></b> in this context is referring <b>only to Gehenna, as it is stated: “That this shall not be a cause of stumbling [<i>puka</i>] to you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31), <b>and</b> the word <b><i>peliliyya</i></b> here is referring <b>only to judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges determine [<i>bifelilim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:22). The response of the Attribute of Justice was essentially that the Jewish people have also sinned and are consequently liable to receive punishment. |
| Isaiah 28:7 | “These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink…they stumble [ paku ] in judgment [ peliliyya ]” | Sanhedrin 111b:5 | <b>The attribute of justice said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, how do these</b> people, who possess these qualities, <b>differ from those</b> who engage in Torah study but lack these qualities? God <b>said to</b> the attribute of justice that those others do not receive the crown and diadem because: <b>“These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink…they stumble [<i>paku</i>] in judgment [<i>peliliyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:7). <b>And <i>puka</i></b> in this context is referring to <b>nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That this shall not be a cause of stumbling [<i>puka</i>] for you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31). <b>And</b> the term of <b><i>pelila</i></b> in the verse in Isaiah is referring to <b>nothing other than judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges [<i>biflilim</i>] determine”</b> (Exodus 21:22). Those who lack the qualities listed in the previous verses are not worthy of the aforementioned reward. |
| Isaiah 28:9 | He sits and teaches Torah to schoolchildren, as it is stated: “Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make to understand the message? Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts” | Avodah Zarah3b:11 | The Gemara asks: If God no longer makes sport, <b>what does He</b> now <b>do during the fourth</b> three-hour period of the day? The Gemara answers: <b>He sits and teaches Torah to schoolchildren, as it is stated: “Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make to understand the message? Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 28:9). The verse is interpreted in the following manner: <b>To whom</b> does God <b>teach knowledge, and to whom does He make to understand the message? To</b> those <b>who are</b> just <b>weaned from the milk and to</b> those <b>who are drawn from the breasts,</b> i.e., children only recently weaned from nursing. |
| Isaiah 28:9 | nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge? | Sotah 12b:20 | The Gemara answers: This <b>teaches that</b> prior to this, <b>they took Moses around to all the Egyptian</b> wet nurses <b>and he did not</b> agree to <b>nurse</b> from any of them, as <b>he said:</b> Shall <b>a mouth that in the future</b> will <b>speak with the Divine Presence</b> actually <b>nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge?</b> And whom shall one make understand the message?” (Isaiah 28:9). The prophet is asking: <b>To whom shall</b> God <b>teach</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of the Torah, <b>and to whom shall</b> God <b>make to understand the message</b> of the Torah? The answer is as the verse continues: <b>“Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 28:9). The conclusion of the verse indicates that the Torah should be taught to the one who did not want to nurse from the milk of a gentile woman, i.e., Moses. |
| Isaiah 28:19 | them, as it is stated: “As often as it passes through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and the mere understanding of the report shall bring terror” | Sanhedrin 95b:11 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: That period was the season of the ripening of the fruit. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Gabriel: When you emerge to ripen</b> the <b>fruits, attend to</b> the army of Assyria and destroy <b>them, as it is stated: “As often as it passes through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and the mere understanding of the report shall bring terror”</b> (Isaiah 28:19), indicating that Gabriel was to kill them while engaged in another activity. <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: While on your path, appear before your enemy</b> and afflict him. |
| Isaiah 28:20 | Amon introduced it into the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “For the bed is too short for spreading, and the covering too narrow for when he gathers himself” | Sanhedrin 103b:8 | <b>Ahaz placed</b> that idol <b>in the upper chamber</b> in the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz”</b> (II Kings 23:12). <b>Manasseh placed it in the Sanctuary</b> itself, <b>as it is stated: “And he set the graven image of the <i>ashera</i> that he had crafted, in that house of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son: In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name forever”</b> (II Kings 21:7). <b>Amon introduced it into the Holy of Holies, as it is stated: “For the bed is too short for spreading, and the covering too narrow for when he gathers himself”</b> (Isaiah 28:20). |
| Isaiah 28:20 | Idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed. Idol worship, as it is written: “The bed is too short for stretching [ mehistare’a ], | Yoma 9b:3 | § The <i>Tosefta</i> continues with a discussion of the sins of the Jewish people over the generations: <b>Due to what</b> reason <b>was</b> the <b>First Temple destroyed?</b> It was destroyed <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there were three matters</b> that existed <b>in</b> the First Temple: <b>Idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed. Idol worship, as it is written: “The bed is too short for stretching [<i>mehistare’a</i>],</b> and the cover is too narrow for gathering” (Isaiah 28:20). |
| Isaiah 28:22 | anyone who scoffs, suffering will befall him, as it is stated: “Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest your suffering be made strong” | Avodah Zarah18b:13 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who scoffs, suffering will befall him, as it is stated: “Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest your suffering be made strong”</b> (Isaiah 28:22). Similarly, <b>Rava said to the Sages</b> who were sitting before him: <b>Please, I ask of you that you not scoff, so that suffering will not befall you.</b> |
| Isaiah 28:22 | upon the world, as it is stated: “Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest your suffering be made strong; for an extermination wholly determined have I heard | Avodah Zarah18b:15 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya says,</b> based on the same verse: <b>Anyone who is haughty falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he acts in arrogant wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:24). <b>And wrath means nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). <b>Rabbi Ḥanilai bar Ḥanilai says: Anyone who scoffs causes extermination</b> to be wrought <b>upon the world, as it is stated: “Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest your suffering be made strong; for an extermination wholly determined have I heard</b> from the Lord, the God of hosts, upon the whole land” (Isaiah 28:22). |
| Isaiah 28:26 | “And chastise in judgment; his God will instruct him” | Sanhedrin 105a:6 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And chastise in judgment; his God will instruct him”</b> (Isaiah 28:26), <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>the prophet said to the Jewish people: Repent. They said to him: We cannot,</b> since <b>the evil inclination dominates us. He said to them: Chastise your inclinations. They said to him: “His God will instruct him,”</b> i.e., God should instruct the evil inclination to allow us to overcome him, as we are incapable of doing so on our own. |
| Isaiah 28:29 | Wonderful is His counsel [ etza ], and great is His wisdom” | Avodah Zarah17b:3 | <b>The Sages said to Rava: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>mezimma</i>? If we say</b> that it is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that will guard you, <b>as it is written in it: “<i>Zimma</i>”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), <b>and we translate</b> this term as: <b>The counsel of [<i>atzat</i>] the sinners,</b> demonstrating that <i>zimma</i> is referring to counsel or wisdom, <b>and</b> the term <i>etza</i> <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> with regard to the Torah: “This also comes forth from the Lord of hosts: <b>Wonderful is His counsel [<i>etza</i>], and great is His wisdom”</b> (Isaiah 28:29), this is difficult. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b><i>Zimma</i>,</b> and not <i>mezimma</i>. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: From lewd matters [<i>midevar zimma</i>], it shall watch over you, the Torah shall guard you,</b> i.e., the term discernment is a reference to the Torah. |
| Isaiah 28:29 | from here: “Wonderful is His counsel, and great His wisdom [ tushiyya ]” | Sanhedrin 26b:7 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written:</b> “He raises up the poor out of the dust, He lifts up the needy from the dung hill, to make them sit with princes and inherit the throne of glory; <b>for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and He has set [<i>vayyashet</i>] the world upon them”</b> (I Samuel 2:8). Since the righteous are considered the foundations of the world, this verse is interpreted in reference to them. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “Wonderful is His counsel, and great His wisdom [<i>tushiyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:29). Accordingly, the wise, righteous people are called <i>shatot</i>. |
| Isaiah 29:4 | as it is stated: “And brought down, you shall speak out of the ground” | Rosh Hashanah31b:1 | <b>and from Yavne to Usha; and from Usha</b> it returned <b>to Yavne; and from Yavne</b> it went back <b>to Usha; and from Usha to Shefaram; and from Shefaram to Beit She’arim; and from Beit She’arim to Tzippori; and from Tzippori to Tiberias. And Tiberias is lower than all of them,</b> as it is in the Jordan Valley. A verse alludes to these movements, <b>as it is stated: “And brought down, you shall speak out of the ground”</b> (Isaiah 29:4). |
| Isaiah 29:4 | “And your voice shall be as a ghost out of the ground” | Sanhedrin 65b:7 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the verse: <b>“And your voice shall be as a ghost out of the ground”</b> (Isaiah 29:4). <b>What, does</b> the dead person <b>not speak</b> from the grave <b>on his own?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not so, <b>as</b> the dead person <b>rises</b> by sorcery <b>and sits between the joints</b> of the necromancer <b>and speaks.</b> |
| Isaiah 29:14 | “Therefore, behold, I will continue to astonish this people with wondrous astonishment, | Shabbat 138b:9 | With regard to <b>Torah,</b> Rav Huna related <b>that Rav said: The Torah is destined to be forgotten from the Jewish people. It is stated</b> at the conclusion of the curses in the Torah’s reproof: <b>“And the Lord will make your plagues astonishing,</b> and the plagues of your seed, great plagues of long continuance, and evil diseases of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:59). <b>This</b> term of <b>astonishment,</b> mentioned in the verse in addition to the explicit punishments, <b>I do not know what it is.</b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states</b> elsewhere: <b>“Therefore, behold, I will continue to astonish this people with wondrous astonishment,</b> and the wisdom of its wise will be lost, and the understanding of its men of understanding shall be hidden” (Isaiah 29:14), you must <b>say: This astonishment</b> is referring to forgetting the <b>Torah.</b> |
| Isaiah 29:15 | as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, | Bava Kamma79b:8 | <b>As it were,</b> the thief <b>establishes the eye below,</b> i.e., God’s eye, <b>as though it does not see, and the ear below,</b> i.e., God’s ear, <b>as though it does not hear.</b> The Gemara cites verses that describe people who imagine that God does not see their actions, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark,</b> and they say: Who sees us, and who knows us?” (Isaiah 29:15). <b>And it is written: “And they say: The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed”</b> (Psalms 94:7). <b>And it is written: “For they say: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see”</b> (Ezekiel 9:9). |
| Isaiah 29:22 | “Therefore, so says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham; | Sanhedrin 19b:18 | The Gemara cites another derivation connected to child-rearing: <b>“Therefore, so says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham;</b> Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale” (Isaiah 29:22). <b>But where have we found</b> any indication <b>about Jacob that he redeemed Abraham? Rav Yehuda says:</b> It means <b>that he redeemed him from the suffering of raising children,</b> in that Abraham did not have twelve tribes and the resultant hardships involved in raising them, as Jacob did, as Jacob assumed the burden of raising the tribes of Israel. <b>And this is as it is written: “Jacob shall not now be ashamed,</b> neither shall his face now wax pale,” meaning: <b>“Jacob shall not now be ashamed” before his father,</b> and <b>“neither shall his face now wax pale” before his father’s father,</b> since he took upon himself the role that they bore as well. |
| Isaiah 29:23 | holiness? As it is stated: “They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall revere the God of Israel” | Megillah 17b:10 | The Gemara continues: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>understanding after</b> the blessing of <b>holiness? As it is stated: “They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall revere the God of Israel”</b> (Isaiah 29:23), and adjacent to that verse it is written: <b>“They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding”</b> (Isaiah 29:24). This shows that it is proper for the theme of understanding to follow the theme of God’s holiness. <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>repentance after</b> the blessing of <b>understanding? As it is written: “And they will understand with their heart, repent, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10-11), showing that the theme of repentance properly follows the theme of understanding. |
| Isaiah 29:24 | “They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding” | Megillah 17b:10 | The Gemara continues: <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute <b>to say</b> the blessing of <b>understanding after</b> the blessing of <b>holiness? As it is stated: “They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall revere the God of Israel”</b> (Isaiah 29:23), and adjacent to that verse it is written: <b>“They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding”</b> (Isaiah 29:24).

| Isaiah 30:4 | that they would raise kings there, as it is written: “For his princes are at Zoan” | Ketubot 112a:7 | <b>And you have no more outstanding</b> earth <b>among all the lands</b> other <b>than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 13:10). <b>And you have no more outstanding</b> region <b>in all of the land of Egypt than Zoan.</b> The superior quality of Zoan is derived from the fact <b>that they would raise kings there, as it is written: “For his princes are at Zoan”</b> (Isaiah 30:4). <b>And you have no rockier</b> terrain <b>in all of Eretz Yisrael than Hebron, as</b> people <b>would bury</b> their <b>dead there,</b> e.g., the Patriarchs in the Cave of Machpelah, because the land was not arable. |
| Isaiah 30:4 | “For his princes are in Zoan” | Sotah 34b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the meaning of the verse is <b>that</b> Hebron <b>was seven times more fruitful [<i>mevunna</i>] than Zoan. And there is no stonier land in Eretz Yisrael than Hebron.</b> This is evident <b>because they would bury the dead there,</b> just as the forefathers were buried there. This was done only in land that was not suitable for agriculture. <b>And of all the lands, there is none of a higher quality than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 13:10). <b>And there was no higher-quality</b> land <b>in all of the land of Egypt than Zoan, as it is written</b> with regard to Pharaoh’s ministers, who would certainly have lived on the finest land in the country: <b>“For his princes are in Zoan”</b> (Isaiah 30:4). <b>And even so, Hebron was seven times more fruitful than Zoan.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:14 | and there shall not be found among its pieces a shard to rake fire on the hearth” | Shabbat 82a:8 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who carries out a shard of <b>earthenware</b> on Shabbat is liable if it is in a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to place between one pillar and another</b> when piled on the ground to separate them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> In a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to stoke a fire with it. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> In a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to hold a quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>in it. Rabbi Meir said: Although there is no proof for the matter,</b> there is a biblical <b>allusion to</b> my opinion, as it is stated: “And He shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, smashing it without sparing; <b>and there shall not be found among its pieces a shard to rake fire on the hearth”</b> (Isaiah 30:14). <b>Rabbi Yosei said to him:</b> Is there <b>proof from there?</b> The verse concludes: <b>“And to extract water from the cistern,”</b> indicating that earthenware is significant if it is large enough to hold water. |

| Isaiah 30:18 | in each generation who greet the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Happy are all they who wait for Him [ lo ]” | Sanhedrin 97b:11 | Apropos that verse, <b>Abaye said: The world</b> has <b>no fewer than thirty-six righteous</b> people <b>in each generation who greet the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Happy are all they who wait for Him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 30:18). <b>The numerical value of <i>lo</i>,</b> spelled <i>lamed vav</i>, <b>is thirty-six.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rava say: The row</b> of the righteous <b>before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> extends <b>eighteen thousand parasangs, as it is stated</b> with regard to the city of God at the end of days: <b>“It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about,</b> and the name of the city from that day shall be: The Lord is there” (Ezekiel 48:35)? The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Abaye refers to the thirty-six righteous people <b>who view</b> the Divine Presence <b>through a luminous crystal [<i>be’ispaklarya</i>],</b> and <b>that</b> statement of Rava refers to the multitudes <b>who view</b> the Divine Presence <b>through a crystal that is not luminous.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:18 | the verse states: “And therefore will the Lord wait, to be gracious to you; and therefore will He be exalted, to have mercy upon you; | Sanhedrin 97b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And it declares [<i>veyafe’aḥ</i>] of the end, and does not lie”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: May those who calculate the end of days be cursed [<i>tippaḥ</i>], as they would say once the end</b> of days that they calculated <b>arrived and</b> the Messiah <b>did not come,</b> that <b>he will no longer come</b> at all. <b>Rather,</b> the proper behavior is to continue to <b>wait for his</b> coming, <b>as it is stated: “Though it tarry, wait for it.” Lest you say we are</b> expectantly <b>awaiting</b> the end of days <b>and</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>is not awaiting</b> the end of days and does not want to redeem His people, <b>the verse states: “And therefore will the Lord wait, to be gracious to you; and therefore will He be exalted, to have mercy upon you;</b> for the Lord is a God of judgment; happy are all they who wait for Him” (Isaiah 30:18). |
| Isaiah 30:18 | who greet the Divine Presence every day, as it is stated: “Happy are all they that wait for Him [ lo ]” | Sukkah 45b:6 | The Gemara asks further: <b>And are</b> those <b>who view</b> the Divine Presence through <b>a bright partition so few? But didn’t Abaye say: The world</b> has <b>no fewer than thirty-six righteous</b> people in each generation <b>who greet the Divine Presence every day, as it is stated: “Happy are all they that wait for Him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 30:18)? <b>The numerological value of <i>lo</i>,</b> spelled <i>lamed vav</i>, <b>is thirty-six,</b> alluding to the fact that there are at least thirty-six full-fledged righteous individuals in each generation. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Abaye is referring to those <b>who enter</b> to greet the Divine Presence <b>by</b> requesting and being granted <b>permission,</b> while <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai is referring to those <b>who enter</b> even <b>without</b> requesting <b>permission,</b> for whom the gates of Heaven are open at all times.

| Isaiah 30:19 | his prayer is listened to, as it is stated: “For, O people that dwells in Zion at Jerusalem, you shall weep no more; He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry.

When He shall hear, He will answer you”</b> (Isaiah 30:19), <b>and after it is written: “And the Lord shall give you sparse bread and scant water”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). This verse indicates that those who sit and study Torah, that is, the people who dwell in Zion, and eat bread sparingly, will have their prayers answered by God. |
| Isaiah 30:20 | incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher” | Eruvin 13b:5 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The fact <b>that I am</b> more <b>incisive than my colleagues is</b> due to the fact <b>that I saw Rabbi Meir from behind,</b> i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. <b>Had I seen him from the front, I would be</b> even more <b>incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind. |

He added: <b>And</b> it is preferable for you to <b>sit on the rubbish heaps [<i>akilkelei</i>] of Mata Meḥasya, and do not sit in the palaces [<i>appadnei</i>] of Pumbedita.

| Isaiah 30:20 | Rav Mesharshiyya said to his sons: When you want to go to study in the presence of your teacher, initially study the mishnayot and then ascend before your teacher.

| Isaiah 30:20 | is not locked before him, as it is stated: “And your Teacher shall not hide Himself anymore” | Sotah 49a:6 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> A Torah scholar who engages in Torah study despite economic pressures <b>is satiated with the glory of the Divine Presence, as it is stated</b> in the same verse, above: <b>“And your eyes shall behold your Teacher.” Rabbi Aḥa, son of Ḥanina, said: Even the</b> concealing <b>partition</b> [<b><i>pargod</i></b>] before the Divine Presence <b>is not locked before him, as it is stated: “And your Teacher shall not hide Himself anymore”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). |
| Isaiah 30:21 | As it is stated: “And your ears shall hear a word behind you saying: | Megillah 32a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Shefatya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one was deliberating about whether to do a certain action, and a Divine Voice indicated what he should do, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that one may make use of a Divine Voice</b> and rely upon it? <b>As it is stated: “And your ears shall hear a word behind you saying:</b> This is the way, walk in it” (Isaiah 30:21). The Gemara comments: <b>This applies</b> only <b>when one heard a male voice in the city,</b> which is unusual, for men are usually found in the fields, <b>or</b> when one heard <b>a female voice in the fields,</b> for women are generally not found there. Since the voice is unusual, one need not doubt it and may rely upon it. <b>And that</b> applies <b>when</b> the voice repeated its message and <b>said: Yes, yes. And that</b> also applies <b>when</b> the voice <b>said: No, no.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:21 | “And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying: This is the path, walk on it, when you turn to the right or to the left” | Shabbat 153a:4 | <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma</b> before <b>Rav: Which</b> type of person <b>has a share in the World-to-Come?</b> He <b>said to him:</b> We can derive this from the verse: <b>“And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying: This is the path, walk on it, when you turn to the right or to the left”</b> (Isaiah 30:21). In other words, if people eulogize one by saying that others should follow in his path, he must have a share in the World-to-Come. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone with whom our Rabbis are pleased</b> has a share in the World-to-Come. In interpreting the verse: <b>“And the eulogizers walk about the marketplace”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:5), <b>the people of the Galilee say: Do things</b> that you will want people to say at your eulogy <b>in front of your bier. The people of Judea say: Do things</b> that you want people to say at your eulogy <b>behind your bier.</b> The Gemara remarks: <b>And they do not disagree;</b> this <b>Sage</b> expressed it according to the norm <b>in his place, and</b> this <b>Sage</b> expressed it differently according to the norm <b>in his place.</b> The custom in the Galilee was that the eulogizers would stand before the bier and the custom in Judea was that eulogizers would stand behind the bier. |
| Isaiah 30:22 | like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will put them far away as a menstruating woman; you shall say to it: Go away” | Avodah Zarah47b:3 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Those items transmit impurity <b>like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will put them far away as a menstruating woman; you shall say to it: Go away”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity by carrying,</b> as one who moves a menstruating woman, even without touching her, becomes impure, <b>so too,</b> objects of <b>idol worship transmit impurity by carrying.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:22 | , you will cast them away as you would a menstruating woman [ dava ], you will tell it, get out” | Shabbat 82a:12 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Akiva said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that idolatry, e.g.,</b> a statue of a deity<b>, transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying</b> even when the person who carries it does not come into contact with it<b>, just as</b> a <b>menstruating woman</b> does? <b>As it is stated: “</b>And you will defile the silver overlays of your statues<b>,</b> and the golden plating of your idols<b>, you will cast them away as you would a menstruating woman [<i>dava</i>], you will tell it, get out”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying, so too, idolatry transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:22 | like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will cast them away as you would a menstruating woman [ dava ]” | Shabbat 82b:1 | If the wall stood upon ground that <b>belonged to him and to the</b> house of <b>idolatry,</b> the area <b>is calculated as half and half</b> as far as moving into his property before rebuilding the wall, and one may build the wall four cubits from the middle of the wall. <b>Its stones and its wood and its dust</b> from the house of idolatry <b>transmit impurity like creeping animals,</b> and by rabbinic decree, one who touches them becomes impure like one who touches a creeping animal, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house and become banned like it, <b>you shall utterly detest it [<i>shaketz teshaketzenu</i>]</b> and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is a banned object” (Deuteronomy 7:26). <i>Shaketz</i> is a term used with regard to creeping animals. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Idolatry transmits impurity <b>like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will cast them away as you would a menstruating woman [<i>dava</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying,</b> as one who moves a menstruating woman without touching her becomes impure, <b>so too, idolatry transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying. Rabba said</b> in explanation of that which <b>the verse said: “You will cast them away”: Make them foreign to you like a stranger.</b> The end of the same verse: <b>“You will tell it, get out”</b> means that under <b>no</b> circumstances can you <b>say to it, come in.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:23 | your cattle shall graze in wide pastures [ kar nirḥav ] on that day” | Menachot 87a:17 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One should bring lambs whose height is like their width,</b> i.e., they are so robust that they are as wide as they are tall. <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written:</b> “And He will give the rain for your seed, with which you sow the ground, and bread of the produce of the ground, and it shall be fat and bountiful; <b>your cattle shall graze in wide pastures [<i>kar nirḥav</i>] on that day”</b> (Isaiah 30:23). The word “<i>kar</i>” can also mean a lamb, and “<i>nirḥav</i>” means wide. Accordingly, Rabbi Yehuda interprets this verse, on a homiletical level, to be alluding to robust sheep. |
| Isaiah 30:26 | it is written: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, | Pesachim 68a:16 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raised a contradiction</b> between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed,</b> when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders will be His glory” (Isaiah 24:23), which indicates that in the future there will be no light at all from the sun or the moon. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days,</b> on the day that the Lord binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound blow” (Isaiah 30:26), which indicates that the light of the sun and moon will be even brighter than before. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where it says that the sun and the moon will be ashamed before the glow of the Divine Presence, it is referring <b>to the World</b>-<b>to</b>-<b>Come,</b> which is an entirely different world; while <b>there,</b> where it says that their light will increase, it is referring <b>to the days of the Messiah.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:26 | And it is written: “And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days” | Sanhedrin 91b:10 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raises a contradiction. It is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts will reign</b> in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be His glory” (Isaiah 24:23), indicating that the sun and the moon will no longer shine at the end of days. <b>And it is written: “And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days”</b> (Isaiah 30:26), indicating that the sun and the moon will exist then and they will shine more brightly. The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult.</b> The verse <b>here,</b> in Isaiah chapter 30, is written with regard <b>to the days of the Messiah,</b> when the sun and moon will shine more brightly; the verse <b>there,</b> in Isaiah chapter 24, is written with regard <b>to the World-to-Come,</b> when the only light will be the light of God. |
| Isaiah 30:29 | as it is written: “You shall have a song as in the night when a festival is sanctified” | Arakhin 10b:3 | The Gemara objects: On the <b>New Moon, which is called an appointed day, let</b> us <b>say</b> <i>hallel</i>. The Gemara explains: The New Moon <b>is not sanctified with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>the performance of labor,</b> and <i>hallel</i> is recited only on a day that is sanctified, <b>as it is written: “You shall have a song as in the night when a festival is sanctified”</b> (Isaiah 30:29), which indicates that <b>a night that is sanctified as a Festival,</b> which includes a prohibition of labor, <b>requires song, but</b> one <b>that is not sanctified as a Festival does not require song.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:29 | the verse states: “You shall have a song as in the night when a Festival is sanctified” | Pesachim 95b:2 | It was taught in the mishna that the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>requires</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i> as it is eaten,</b> whereas on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> it does not. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, citing Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak,</b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall have a song as in the night when a Festival is sanctified”</b> (Isaiah 30:29). From here it may be derived that <b>a night sanctified as a Festival,</b> on which labor is prohibited, such as the first night of Passover, <b>requires</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i>;</b> however, <b>a night which is not sanctified as a Festival,</b> such as the night when the Paschal lamb is eaten following the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>does not require</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i>.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:33 | Tofte, as it is written: “For its hearth [ tofte ] is ordained of old” | Eruvin 19a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t there</b> also the name <b>Tofte, as it is written: “For its hearth [<i>tofte</i>] is ordained of old”</b> (Isaiah 30:33). The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> name too is a description, meaning <b>that anyone who allows himself to be seduced [<i>mitpateh</i>] by his</b> evil <b>inclination will fall there.</b> |
| Isaiah 30:33 | deep and large, | Menachot 100a:1 | <b>within it. And lest you say: Just as the opening</b> of Gehenna <b>is narrow, so</b> too, <b>all of</b> Gehenna <b>is narrow, the verse states:</b> “For Gehenna has been arranged of old, it has been prepared even for the king, <b>deep and large,</b> its pile is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord kindles it like a stream of brimstone” (Isaiah 30:33). |
| Isaiah 30:33 | as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old” | Nedarim 39b:8 | <b>Gehenna</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old”</b> (Isaiah 30:33). The hearth, i.e., Gehenna, was created before the world was created. |
| Isaiah 30:33 | as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old” | Pesachim 54a:10 | <b>The Garden of Eden</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “And God planted the Garden of Eden in the east [<i>mikedem</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:8). The term: In the east [<i>mikedem</i>] is interpreted in the sense of: Before [<i>mikodem</i>], i.e., before the world was created. <b>Gehenna</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old”</b> (Isaiah 30:33). The hearth, i.e., Gehenna, was created before the world was created. |
| Isaiah 31:5 | a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Isaiah 31:9 | in Jerusalem, as it is written: “Says the Lord, Whose fire is in Zion, and Whose furnace is in Jerusalem” | Eruvin 19a:14 | And there is a third entrance to Gehenna <b>in Jerusalem, as it is written: “Says the Lord, Whose fire is in Zion, and Whose furnace is in Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:9). <b>And</b> it was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: “Whose fire is in Zion,” this is Gehenna; and “Whose furnace is in Jerusalem,” this is an entrance to Gehenna.</b> |
| Isaiah 32:5 | “The vile person shall no longer be called generous, nor shall the churl be said to be noble” | Sotah 41b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and some say Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, taught: It is permitted to flatter wicked people in this world, as it is stated</b> concerning the future: <b>“The vile person shall no longer be called generous, nor shall the churl be said to be noble”</b> (Isaiah 32:5). <b>By inference,</b> this indicates <b>that in this world it is permitted</b> to flatter them. |
| Isaiah 32:9 | made by the Holy One, Blessed be He, to women than to men, as it is stated: “Rise up, women at ease; hear My voice, confident daughters, listen to what I say” | Berakhot 17a:13 | The Gemara states: <b>Greater is the promise</b> for the future <b>made by the Holy One, Blessed be He, to women than to men, as it is stated: “Rise up, women at ease; hear My voice, confident daughters, listen to what I say”</b> (Isaiah 32:9). This promise of ease and confidence is not given to men. |
| Isaiah 32:12 | on the heart, as it is written: “Striking [ sofedim ] the breasts” | Moed Katan27b:7 | The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>Ulla said:</b> Although <i>hesped</i> usually refers to a eulogy, strictly speaking, <b><i>hesped</i></b> is referring to striking oneself <b>on the heart, as it is written: “Striking [<i>sofedim</i>] the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 32:12). The term <b><i>tipuaḥ</i></b> is referring to striking <b>with</b> one <b>hand</b> against the other hand, i.e., clapping. The term <b><i>killus</i></b> is referring to stomping <b>with</b> one’s <b>foot</b> on the ground. |
| Isaiah 32:17 | as it is stated: “And the causing [ ma’aseh ] of righteousness shall be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever” | Bava Batra9a:13 | The Gemara offers <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following statements extolling the mitzva of charity: <b>Greater; Temple; Moses. Rabbi Elazar says: One who causes others to perform [<i>me’aseh</i>]</b> a meritorious act <b>is greater than one who performs</b> that act himself, <b>as it is stated: “And the causing [<i>ma’aseh</i>] of righteousness shall be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever”</b> (Isaiah 32:17). If one <b>merits,</b> the following verse is applied to him: <b>“Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), i.e., he will wholeheartedly give charity to the poor. If he <b>does not merit,</b> the latter clause of that verse is applied to him: <b>“You shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house,”</b> i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and sustain them against his will. |
| Isaiah 32:20 | which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Avodah Zarah5b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Bana’a: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20)? <b>Happy are you Israel; when they,</b> i.e., the Jewish people, <b>engage in Torah</b> study <b>and in acts of kindness, their</b> evil <b>inclination is given over to them, and they are not given over to their</b> evil <b>inclination, as it is stated: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters.” And</b> the term <b>sowing</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> performing <b>charitable</b> deeds, <b>as it is stated: “Sow to yourselves according to charitableness, reap according to mercy”</b> (Hosea 10:12). <b>And</b> the term <b>waters</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> the <b>Torah, as it is stated: “Ho, every one that thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Isaiah 32:20 | which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Bava Kamma17a:8 | § A verse that was cited at the beginning of this chapter (2b) as part of a halakhic exposition is now explained homiletically: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20)? It teaches that <b>whoever engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah and in</b> the performance of <b>acts of kindness merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes,</b> Joseph and Issachar. |
| Isaiah 32:20 | that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Bava Kamma2b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where are Eating and Trampling written</b> in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <b>“And he sends forth,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling,</b> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <b>and likewise it states:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal. |
| Isaiah 32:20 | connotes Trampling and connotes Eating. It connotes Trampling, as it is written: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Bava Kamma3a:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let the Merciful One write</b> only the first phrase, <b>“and he sends forth,” and there would be no need</b> to write the second phrase, <b>“and it consumed,” as</b> the phrase “and he sends forth” <b>connotes Trampling and connotes Eating. It connotes Trampling, as it is written: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20), and <b>it connotes Eating, as it is written: “And the teeth of animals I will send forth against them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24). |
| Isaiah 32:20 | that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Bava Kamma3a:2 | <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> just cited: <b>“And he sends forth,” this</b> is a reference to <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling, and likewise it says:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the phrase: “And he sends forth,” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Trampling is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.”</b> The Gemara asks: Were <b>it not for this</b> verse, <b>with regard to what would you have interpreted</b> that phrase? |
| Isaiah 32:20 | states: “That send forth [ meshaleḥei ] the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Bava Kamma55b:15 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the term <b><i>veshilaḥ</i>: This</b> is referring to damage by <b>Trampling, and similarly,</b> the verse <b>states: “That send forth [<i>meshaleḥei</i>] the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). With regard to the term <b><i>uvi’er</i>: This</b> is referring to damage by <b>Eating, and similarly,</b> the verse <b>states: “As one consumes with the tooth, until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10). |
| Isaiah 32:20 | by her feet, as it is written: “That send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey” | Chullin 141b:9 | § The mishna teaches that according to the Rabbis, if one transgressed the mitzva and took the mother bird with the young, one must send away the mother. The Gemara asks: <b>How far</b> from the nest must he <b>send her? Rav Yehuda says:</b> Far <b>enough that she leaves his grasp</b> and can no longer be caught immediately. The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does</b> he <b>send her</b> away?<b>Rav Huna says:</b> He holds the mother <b>by her feet</b> and sends her away. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> He holds her <b>by her wings [<i>baagappeha</i>]</b> and sends her away. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that one holds the mother <b>by her feet, as it is written: “That send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20), indicating that the sending of an animal is associated with its feet. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that one holds her <b>by her wings, because</b> the feet of the mother bird <b>are her wings,</b> as it is by means of her wings that she moves about. |
| Isaiah 33:3 | and they died, as it is stated: “From Your exaltation the nations were scattered” | Sanhedrin 95b:12 | <b>And there are those who say:</b> The angel <b>blew into</b> the soldiers of the Assyrian army <b>through their noses and they died, as it is stated: “When he blows upon them, and they wither”</b> (Isaiah 40:24). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> The angel <b>clapped his hands to them and they died, as it is stated: “I will also strike My hands together and I will assuage My anger”</b> (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: He revealed ears for them and they</b> were able to <b>hear the songs</b> of praise <b>from the mouths of the</b> celestial <b>creatures</b> drawing the chariot of God, <b>and they died, as it is stated: “From Your exaltation the nations were scattered”</b> (Isaiah 33:3), indicating that their death was caused by the revelation of God’s greatness. |
| Isaiah 33:4 | “And your spoils shall be gathered like the gathering of the locusts; | Sanhedrin 94b:16 | It is written: <b>“And your spoils shall be gathered like the gathering of the locusts;</b> as the advance of the locusts shall he advance” (Isaiah 33:4). <b>The prophet said to the Jewish people: Gather your spoils</b> from the army of Sennacherib. <b>They said to him:</b> Are we <b>to pillage</b> the spoils, each person for himself, <b>or</b> are we <b>to divide</b> the spoils with the monarchy? <b>He said to them:</b> Gather the spoils <b>like the gathering by the locusts. Just as</b> in <b>the gathering by the locusts, each and every one</b> of the locusts takes food <b>for itself, so too,</b> in gathering <b>your spoils, each and every one</b> of you shall take spoils <b>for himself.</b> |
| Isaiah 33:4 | He said to them: “As the advance of the locusts [ gevim ] shall he advance” | Sanhedrin 94b:17 | <b>They said to him:</b> Since the army of Sennacherib came to Jerusalem after its conquest of the kingdom of Israel, <b>isn’t the property of the ten tribes intermingled with it,</b> and therefore, gathering the spoils would be robbery? <b>He said to them: “As the advance of the locusts [<i>gevim</i>] shall he advance”</b> (Isaiah 33:4). <b>Just as these pools</b> of water <b>elevate a person up from</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity to</b> a state of <b>purity</b> through immersion, <b>so too the property of the Jewish people, once it falls into the hands of gentiles, it immediately purifies</b> the property, in the sense that it is no longer considered robbery to take it, as its owners despair of its recovery. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa says:</b> The property of <b>Ammon and Moab was purified through</b> the conquest of <b>Sihon.</b> Although the Torah rendered it prohibited to conquer the land of Ammon and Moab, once Sihon conquered their land, it was permitted for the Jewish people to conquer it. |
| Isaiah 33:6 | Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has nothing in his treasury other than a treasure of fear of Heaven, as it is stated: “Fear of the Lord is his treasure” | Berakhot 33b:24 | The verse says: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear the Lord your God. The Gemara asks: <b>Is fear of Heaven a minor matter</b> that it can be presented as if God is not asking anything significant? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has nothing in his treasury other than a treasure of fear of Heaven, as it is stated: “Fear of the Lord is his treasure”</b> (Isaiah 33:6). The Lord values and treasures fear of Heaven over all else. |
| Isaiah 33:6 | that which is written: “And the faith of your times shall be a strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, | Shabbat 31a:10 | The Gemara continues discussing the conduct of the Sages, citing that <b>Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And the faith of your times shall be a strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge,</b> the fear of the Lord is his treasure” (Isaiah 33:6)? <b>Faith; that is the order of <i>Zera</i>’<i>im</i>, Seeds,</b> in the Mishna, because a person has faith in God and plants his seeds (Jerusalem Talmud). <b>Your times; that is the order of <i>Moed</i>, Festival,</b> which deals with the various occasions and Festivals that occur throughout the year. <b>Strength; that is the order of <i>Nashim</i>, Women. Salvations; that is the order of <i>Nezikin</i>, Damages,</b> as one who is being pursued is rescued from the hands of his pursuer. <b>Wisdom; that is the order of <i>Kodashim</i>, Consecrated Items. And knowledge; that is the order of <i>Teharot</i>, Purity,</b> which is particularly difficult to master. <b>And even</b> if a person studies and masters all of these, <b>“the fear of the Lord is his treasure,”</b> it is preeminent. |
| Isaiah 33:7 | The destruction of the Temple is different, as even the angels of peace cried, as it is stated: “Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the angels of peace weep bitterly” | Chagigah 5b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t</b> God cry <b>in the outer chambers? Isn’t it written: “And on that day the Lord, the God of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth”</b> (Isaiah 22:12)? The Gemara responds: <b>The destruction of the Temple is different, as even the angels of peace cried, as it is stated: “Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the angels of peace weep bitterly”</b> (Isaiah 33:7). |
| Isaiah 33:11 | in Gehenna, as it is stated: “You shall conceive chaff; you shall bring forth straw; your soul is a fire that shall devour you” | Sanhedrin 108a:6 | <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosef, says: Even at a time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, restores souls to lifeless corpses,</b> the souls of the generation of the flood <b>will</b> afflict <b>them harshly</b> as if they were <b>in Gehenna, as it is stated: “You shall conceive chaff; you shall bring forth straw; your soul is a fire that shall devour you”</b> (Isaiah 33:11). |
| Isaiah 33:12 | of Rabbi Shimon? As it is written: “And the peoples shall be as the burnings of plaster” | Sotah 35b:11 | <b>Rava bar Sheila said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon? As it is written: “And the peoples shall be as the burnings of plaster”</b> (Isaiah 33:12). This is homiletically interpreted to mean that the nations were punished <b>on account of matters of plaster,</b> i.e., they did not study the Torah that was written on plaster. |
| Isaiah 33:14 | was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid, | Berakhot 60a:17 | The Gemara relates: <b>This student was once walking after Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, in the marketplace of Zion.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saw that</b> the student <b>was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid,</b> trembling has seized the ungodly” (Isaiah 33:14). The student <b>replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> that one should be afraid lest he forget them. For everything else, one must trust in God. |
| Isaiah 33:15 | and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil” | Bava Batra57b:7 | In connection with the matter of laundry being washed in public, the Gemara quotes the homiletic interpretation of a verse: “He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, <b>and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</b> (Isaiah 33:15). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: This</b> is referring to one <b>who does not gaze at women while they are standing over the laundry,</b> as it was common for them to stand in the water and raise the hems of their garments while laundering their clothing. |
| Isaiah 33:15 | upon six, as it is written: “He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from holding of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing blood, and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil” | Makkot 24a:17 | Rabbi Simlai’s exposition continues: <b>Isaiah came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon six, as it is written: “He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from holding of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing blood, and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</b> (Isaiah 33:15). |
| Isaiah 33:15 | his eyes from seeing evil” | Shabbat 77b:3 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to closing the eyes of the dead, <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna <b><i>me’amtzin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i>, <b>or <i>me’amtzin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is written with an <i>ayin</i> as it is stated: <b>“And closes [<i>ve’otzem</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>] <b>his eyes from seeing evil”</b> (Isaiah 33:15). |
| Isaiah 33:16 | “He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks; his bread shall be given, his water shall be sure” | Bava Batra10b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked</b> King <b>Solomon, son of David: How far does the power of charity extend?</b> King Solomon <b>said to them: Go out and see what my father David explained: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn shall be exalted with honor”</b> (Psalms 112:9). <b>Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is derived <b>from here</b> how far the power of charity extends: <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks; his bread shall be given, his water shall be sure”</b> (Isaiah 33:16). <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks”? Because “his bread shall be given”</b> to the poor, <b>and “his water shall be sure,”</b> i.e., it shall be given faithfully and he can be trusted in the matter. |
| Isaiah 33:16 | “He shall dwell on high; | Makkot 24a:24 | <b>And it is written</b> with regard to one who performs these matters: <b>“He shall dwell on high;</b> his fortress shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure” (Isaiah 33:16). |
| Isaiah 33:17 | A king has his hair cut every day, as it is stated: “Your eyes should see the king in his beauty” | Sanhedrin 22b:6 | The Gemara explains: <b>A king has his hair cut every day, as it is stated: “Your eyes should see the king in his beauty”</b> (Isaiah 33:17), so his beauty must be tended to daily. <b>A High Priest</b> waits <b>from the eve of Shabbat</b> to the eve of Shabbat, as <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Since new</b> priestly <b>watches begin</b> every week on the eve of Shabbat, the High Priest must have his hair cut in order to look his best when the new watch arrives. |
| Isaiah 33:17 | the verse states: “Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty” | Taanit 17a:11 | <b>The Sages taught: A king cuts his hair every day, a High Priest</b> cuts his hair <b>every Friday,</b> and <b>a common priest once every thirty days.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>A king cuts his hair every day. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty”</b> (Isaiah 33:17), which indicates that a king must always look his best. <b>A High Priest cuts his hair every Friday.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Since the watches are renewed</b> and changed every Friday, it is fitting for every watch to see the High Priest with his hair perfectly groomed. |
| Isaiah 33:17 | Because it is written: “Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty” | Yoma 78b:9 | The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>the king</b> may wash his face? <b>Because it is written: “Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty”</b> (Isaiah 33:17). A king should always look regal before his nation. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a bride</b> may wash her face? <b>So that she should not</b> appear <b>repulsive to her husband.</b> Since it is only the beginning of their marriage, her husband may be disgusted at seeing her otherwise. <b>Rav said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: For how long</b> after her wedding is a woman considered <b>a bride? He said to him: As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If she becomes a mourner, <b>we do not prevent the bride from wearing perfumes</b> during <b>the entire</b> first <b>thirty days</b> of her marriage. This shows that for the first thirty days, her appearance is most critical. |
| Isaiah 33:18 | “Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?” | Chagigah 15b:12 | The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel found Rav Yehuda leaning on the bar of the door, crying. He said to him: Long-toothed one [<i>shinnana</i>], what are you crying</b> for? <b>He said to him: Is</b> it <b>a small</b> matter, <b>that which is written with regard to Sages</b> who have sinned: <b>“Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?”</b> (Isaiah 33:18). He proceeded to explain: <b>“Where is he who counted”; for they would count all the letters of the Torah. “Where is he who weighed”; for they would weigh</b> and compare the <b>minor and major</b> transgressions <b>of the Torah. “Where is he who counted the towers”; for they would teach three hundred <i>halakhot</i></b> concerning the details of tent impurity <b>involving</b> a wooden <b>closet floating in the air.</b> If they studied a subject so removed from reality in such depths, how much more so did they analyze other issues. |
| Isaiah 33:18 | which is written: “Where is he that counts; where is he that weighs; where is he that counts the towers [ migdalim ]” | Sanhedrin 106b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Where is he that counts; where is he that weighs; where is he that counts the towers [<i>migdalim</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 33:18)? <b>Where is he that counts all the letters of the Torah? Where is he that weighs, who considers all the</b> elements of <b><i>a fortiori</i> inferences in the Torah? Where is he who counts the towers?</b> This is Doeg, <b>who would count three hundred halakhic conclusions with regard to</b> the purity of <b>a cupboard [<i>migdal</i>] that floats in the air [<i>avir</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 33:18 | with regard to whom it is written: “Where is he that counts; where is he that weighs; where is he that counts the towers” | Sanhedrin 106b:15 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: Doeg and Ahithophel did not comprehend halakhic discussions. Mar Zutra objects to this</b> statement: These are people <b>with regard to whom it is written: “Where is he that counts; where is he that weighs; where is he that counts the towers”</b> (Isaiah 33:18), <b>and you say</b> that <b>they did not comprehend halakhic discussions? Rather,</b> Doeg and Ahithophel <b>would not conclude halakhic discussions in accordance with halakhic</b> rulings, <b>as it is written: “The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him”</b> (Psalms 25:14). Since they did not fear God, they did not arrive at halakhic conclusions despite their keen intellect. |
| Isaiah 33:21 | “Neither shall a tzi adir be able to cross it” | Rosh Hashanah23a:8 | § Apropos coral, the Gemara cites a relevant verse: <b>“Neither shall a <i>tzi adir</i> be able to cross it”</b> (Isaiah 33:21), i.e., it will not be able to traverse the river that will issue forth from the Temple in the future. What is this <i>tzi adir</i>? <b>Rav said: This is a great ship [<i>burnei</i>]</b> used to collect coral from the sea. |
| Isaiah 33:21 | the verse states: “No galley with oars shall go” | Yoma 77b:15 | § Apropos the river that will flow in the future, the Gemara explains additional verses in Ezekiel. <b>One might think</b> that Ezekiel <b>could cross</b> the river <b>by swimming. The verse states: “For the water had swollen into <i>saḥu</i> waters”</b> (Ezekiel 47:5). <b>What</b> does <b>“<i>saḥu</i> waters”</b> mean? Water that can be traversed only with <b>a boat</b> [<b><i>shiyuta</i>], as sailing [<i>shayta</i>] is</b> sometimes <b>called swimming [<i>sayḥa</i>]. I might have thought</b> Ezekiel <b>could pass across in a small boat [<i>burni</i>].</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “No galley with oars shall go”</b> (Isaiah 33:21). I <b>might have thought he could pass through in a large boat.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Neither shall a fishing boat [<i>tzi adir</i>] be able to cross it”</b> (Isaiah 33:21). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> can it <b>be inferred</b> that the words <i>tzi adir</i> mean fishing boat? The Gemara explains: This is how <b>Rav Yosef translated</b> this verse: <b>A fishing boat [<i>sfinat tzayyadin</i>] will not travel on it and a large ship will not cross it.</b> |
| Isaiah 33:23 | “The lame take the prey” | Bekhorot 39a:7 | <b>But if it is a blemish from that point forward,</b> then one who derived benefit from money paid before that point has <b>not misused</b> consecrated property, as an unblemished animal cannot be redeemed, and the money remains non-sacred. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Shmuel read</b> this verse <b>with regard to his</b> brother: <b>“The lame take the prey”</b> (Isaiah 33:23), i.e., one who is not learned in Torah has managed to ask a question for which I have no answer. |
| Isaiah 33:24 | Rabbi Elazar said: Anyone who resides in Eretz Yisrael dwells without transgression, as it is stated: “And the inhabitant shall not say: I am sick; the people that dwell there shall be forgiven their iniquity” | Ketubot 111a:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Anyone who resides in Eretz Yisrael dwells without transgression, as it is stated: “And the inhabitant shall not say: I am sick; the people that dwell there shall be forgiven their iniquity”</b> (Isaiah 33:24). <b>Rava said to Rav Ashi: We learned this</b> promise <b>with regard to those who suffer from sickness.</b> The phrase “I am sick” indicates that they are the ones who are forgiven their sins. |
| Isaiah 34:4 | as it is stated: “And all the hosts of heaven shall molder away” | Avodah Zarah17a:14 | <b>He said: Sun and moon, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed”</b> (Isaiah 24:23). <b>He said: Stars and constellations, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “And all the hosts of heaven shall molder away”</b> (Isaiah 34:4). |
| Isaiah 34:11 | Vohu ; these are damp stones submerged in the depths, from which water emerges, as it is stated: “And He shall stretch over it the line of tohu and stones of vohu ” | Chagigah 12a:7 | <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b><i>Tohu</i></b> is <b>a green line that encompasses the entire world, and from which darkness emerges, as it is stated: “He made darkness His hiding place round about Him”</b> (Psalms 18:12), indicating that a line of darkness surrounds the world. <b><i>Vohu</i>; these are damp stones submerged in the depths, from which water emerges, as it is stated: “And He shall stretch over it the line of <i>tohu</i> and stones of <i>vohu</i>”</b> (Isaiah 34:11), which demonstrates that <i>tohu</i> is a line and that <i>vohu</i> is referring to stones. |
| Isaiah 34:11 | pelican and the bittern, | Moed Katan25b:2 | When they reached Tiberias <b>a certain child opened</b> his eulogy saying as follows: <b>The shoot of an ancient line,</b> i.e., Rabba bar Rav Huna, who was the descendant of great people, <b>has ascended from Babylonia, and with him is the book of wars,</b> i.e., Rav Hamnuna, who was great in Torah, which is referred to as the book of the Wars of the Lord (Numbers 21:14). <b>The</b> curses of the <b>pelican and the bittern,</b> which are symbols of the destruction of the Temple (Isaiah 34:11), <b>have been doubled, to see the ruin and brokenness that has come from Shinar,</b> i.e., Babylonia. The Lord <b>became angry with His world and seized souls from it, and He rejoices over them</b> when they come to Him <b>like a new bride.</b> God <b>who rides upon the clouds is joyous and happy when an innocent and righteous soul comes to Him.</b> |
| Isaiah 34:15 | and hatch, and brood under her shadow” | Chullin 140b:9 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to the case of <b>a male pheasant</b> that rests upon the eggs of its species, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send away the pheasant, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from sending it away. With regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, a verbal analogy between <b>brooding</b> stated with regard to a male pheasant and <b>brooding</b> with regard to a female bird <b>comes</b> to indicate that the resting of a male pheasant upon its eggs is considered an effective resting. <b>It is written here: “As the pheasant that broods over young that he has not brought forth”</b> (Jeremiah 17:11), <b>and it is written elsewhere</b> about a female bird: “There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, <b>and hatch, and brood under her shadow”</b> (Isaiah 34:15). Just as a female bird broods over its nest, so too, a male pheasant broods over a nest. Therefore, one is required to send away the male bird from the nest as well. |
| Isaiah 35:2 | in the future, as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it” | Yoma 21b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> miracles performed in the Temple? <b>But didn’t Rav Oshaya say: When Solomon built the Temple he planted all sorts of precious golden fruits there, and</b> these <b>brought forth their fruit in their</b> appointed <b>season</b> like other trees, <b>and when the wind blew them</b> the fruit <b>would fall, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 72:16). This indicates that fruits grew in Lebanon, which the Sages interpreted as a reference to the Temple, which was built with cedar trees from Lebanon. <b>And when the gentiles entered the Sanctuary</b> the golden tree <b>withered, as it stated: “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither”</b> (Nahum 1:4). <b>And the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the</b> miraculous trees to Israel <b>in the future, as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it”</b> (Isaiah 35:2). Apparently, there were additional miracles in the Temple. |
| Isaiah 35:2 | to us as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it” | Yoma 39b:9 | <b>But once the</b> gentile <b>nations entered the Sanctuary</b> the golden trees <b>withered, as it states “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither”</b> (Nahum 1:4). <b>And in the future</b> hour of redemption, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore</b> them <b>to us as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it”</b> (Isaiah 35:2). |
| Isaiah 35:6 | And it is written: “Then shall the lame man leap as a deer and the tongue of the mute sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert” | Sanhedrin 91b:8 | § <b>Reish Lakish raises a contradiction</b> between two verses written with regard to the resurrection of the dead. <b>It is written:</b> “I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the ends of the earth, <b>and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and the woman giving birth together”</b> (Jeremiah 31:7), indicating that at the end of days there will still be people with physical defects. <b>And it is written: “Then shall the lame man leap as a deer and the tongue of the mute sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert”</b> (Isaiah 35:6), indicating that at the end of days there will be no people with physical defects. <b>How so?</b> When resurrected, the dead <b>will arise</b> still afflicted <b>with their defects, and</b> they <b>will</b> then <b>be healed.</b> |
| Isaiah 35:10 | “The redeemed of the Lord shall return, | Berakhot 55b:9 | <b>And three redemptions, as it is written:</b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me;</b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19);<br><b>“The redeemed of the Lord shall return,</b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;<br>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10);<br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel?<br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45). |
| Isaiah 35:10 | comes to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come singing into Zion” | Sanhedrin 110b:5 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The generation of the wilderness <b>comes to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come singing into Zion”</b> (Isaiah 35:10), meaning that those whom God redeemed will yet come to Zion. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Akiva abandoned his piety</b> and uncharacteristically interpreted the verses harshly, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the generation of the wilderness: <b>“Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying,</b> so says the Lord: <b>I remember for you the affection of your youth, the love of your espousals, how you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown”</b> (Jeremiah 2:2). <b>Now, if others come</b> into the World-to-Come <b>in the merit of</b> the generation that left Egypt and followed God in the wilderness, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that the generation of the wilderness <b>themselves</b> have a share in the World-to-Come? |
| Isaiah 35:10 | Reish Lakish said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return them to us, as it is stated: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads” | Shabbat 88a:7 | <b>Rabbi Simai taught: When Israel accorded precedence</b> to the declaration <b>“We will do”</b> over the declaration <b>“We will hear,” 600,000 ministering angels came</b> and <b>tied two crowns to each and every member of the Jewish people, one corresponding to “We will do” and one corresponding to “We will hear.” And when the people sinned</b> with the Golden Calf, <b>1,200,000 angels of destruction descended and removed them</b> from the people, <b>as it is stated</b> in the wake of the sin of the Golden Calf: <b>“And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward”</b> (Exodus 33:6). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: At Horeb they put on</b> their ornaments, <b>and at Horeb they removed</b> them. The source for this is: <b>At Horeb they put them on, as we have said; at Horeb they removed them, as it is written: “And the children of Israel stripped themselves</b> of their ornaments from Mount Horeb.” <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And Moses merited all</b> of these crowns <b>and took</b> them. What is the source for this? <b>Because juxtaposed to this</b> verse, it is stated: <b>“And Moses would take the tent [<i>ohel</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:7). The word <i>ohel</i> is interpreted homiletically as an allusion to an aura or illumination [<i>hila</i>]. <b>Reish Lakish said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return them to us, as it is stated: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads”</b> (Isaiah 35:10). <b>The joy that</b> they <b>once</b> had will once again be <b>upon their heads.</b> |
| Isaiah 35:10 | these two heretics, one named Sason and one named Simḥa. Sason said to Simḥa: I am superior to you, as it is written: “They shall obtain joy [ sason ] and happiness [ simḥa ], | Sukkah 48b:5 | Apropos this verse, the Gemara relates: There were <b>these two heretics, one named Sason and one named Simḥa. Sason said to Simḥa: I am superior to you, as it is written: “They shall obtain joy [<i>sason</i>] and happiness [<i>simḥa</i>],</b> and sorrow and sighing shall flee” (Isaiah 35:10). The verse mentions joy first. <b>Simḥa said to Sason,</b> On the contrary, <b>I am superior to you, as it is written: “There was happiness [<i>simḥa</i>] and joy [<i>sason</i>] for the Jews”</b> (Esther 8:17). <b>Sason said to Simḥa: One day they will dismiss you and render you a messenger [<i>parvanka</i>], as it is written: “For you shall go out with happiness [<i>simḥa</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 55:12). <b>Simḥa said to Sason: One day they will dismiss you and draw water with you, as it is written: “With joy [<i>sason</i>] you shall draw water.”</b> |
| Isaiah 36:20 | as it is written: “Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand | Megillah 11b:3 | The Gemara asks further: <b>But there was Sennacherib,</b> who ruled over the entire world, <b>as it is written: “Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand</b> that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?” (Isaiah 36:20). The Gemara answers: <b>There is Jerusalem that he did not conquer,</b> as indicated in the verse. |
| Isaiah 37:24 | into its farthest height” | Sanhedrin 94b:3 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raises a contradiction. It is written</b> that Sennacherib said: “And I will enter <b>into its farthest height”</b> (Isaiah 37:24), <b>and it is written</b> in a parallel verse that he said: “And I have entered <b>into its farthest lodge”</b> (II Kings 19:23). The Gemara resolves the contradiction. <b>That wicked person said: Initially, I will destroy</b> the earthly <b>dwelling place below,</b> i.e., the Temple, its farthest lodge, <b>and thereafter, I will destroy</b> the heavenly <b>dwelling place above,</b> its farthest height. |
| Isaiah 37:25 | as it is stated: “I dug and drank water” | Sanhedrin 95b:7 | It was <b>taught: The first</b> set of soldiers in the army of Sennacherib <b>crossed by swimming</b> across the Jordan, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall sweep through Judea; he shall overflow and pass”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). Since the water level diminished with their crossing, <b>the middle</b> group of soldiers <b>passed while standing upright, as it is stated: “It shall reach even the neck”</b> (Isaiah 8:8). <b>The last</b> soldiers already <b>kicked up dust with their feet, and they did not find water in the river to drink,</b> and they had no water <b>until they brought water from another place and drank</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “I dug and drank water”</b> (Isaiah 37:25). |
| Isaiah 37:36 | But isn’t it written: “Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses” | Sanhedrin 95b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses”</b> (Isaiah 37:36)? Apparently, there were many fewer soldiers than the number listed in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: These</b> listed here <b>are regiment leaders,</b> who commanded numerous soldiers. |
| Isaiah 38:1 | as it is stated: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came and said to him: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Set your house in order, for you will die and you will not live” | Berakhot 10a:27 | <b>What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do</b> to effect compromise between Hezekiah and Isaiah? <b>He brought the suffering</b> of illness <b>upon Hezekiah and told Isaiah: Go and visit the sick.</b> Isaiah did as God instructed, <b>as it is stated: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came and said to him: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Set your house in order, for you will die and you will not live”</b> (Isaiah 38:1). This seems redundant; <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>you will die and you will not live?</b> This repetition means: <b>You will die in this world, and you will not live,</b> you will have no share, <b>in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Isaiah 38:2 | immediately “Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the Lord” | Berakhot 10b:2 | Having heard Isaiah’s harsh prophecy, <b>immediately “Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 38:2). |
| Isaiah 38:2 | that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed” | Berakhot 5b:21 | The Gemara returns to the topic of prayer. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>Abba Binyamin</b> would <b>say: All of my life I have taken great pains with regard to two things: That my prayer should be before my bed and that my bed should be placed north to south.</b> Abba Binyamin’s statement requires explanation. With regard to his statement: <b>That my prayer should be before my bed,</b> the Gemara asks, <b>what does before my bed</b> mean? <b>If you say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means that he would stand <b>before his bed</b> and pray, it is difficult, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed”</b> (Isaiah 38:2), in order to facilitate his concentration during prayer. That being said, why would Abba Binyamin pray before his bed? Rather, <b>do not say</b> that <b>before my bed</b> refers to where he stood during prayer, but <b>rather, say</b> that he prayed <b>adjacent to</b> the time that he would retire to <b>bed;</b> he was careful to recite <i>Shema</i> and recite the evening prayer just before going to sleep (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). |
| Isaiah 38:3 | upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You” | Berakhot 10b:13 | <b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3). When God answered his prayers, <b>it was based upon the merit of others</b> with no mention made of Hezekiah’s own merit, <b>as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant”</b> (II Kings 19:34). <b>And that is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;</b> but You have, in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back” (Isaiah 38:17)? This verse teaches that <b>even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent him peace</b> and told him that he would recover from his illness, <b>it was bitter for him,</b> because God did not take his merit into consideration. |
| Isaiah 38:3 | please remember that I walked before You in truth, and with a complete heart, and what was good in Your eyes I did. | Berakhot 10b:4 | <b>Rabbi Levi said:</b> Hezekiah intended to evoke <b>matters</b> relating <b>to a wall,</b> and <b>he said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, and if the woman from Shunem, who made only a single small wall</b> on the roof for the prophet Elisha, and <b>you revived her son, all the more so</b> should you bring life to the descendant of <b>my father’s father,</b> King Solomon, <b>who covered the entire</b> Temple <b>Sanctuary with silver and gold.</b> In his prayer, Hezekiah said: “Please, Lord, <b>please remember that I walked before You in truth, and with a complete heart, and what was good in Your eyes I did.</b> And Hezekiah wept sore” (Isaiah 38:3). |
| Isaiah 38:8 | as it is written: “Behold, I will return the shadow of the dial, which descended on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which it had gone down” | Sanhedrin 96a:11 | <b>And when Hezekiah fell ill and recovered, the Holy One, Blessed be He, restored those ten hours to</b> Hezekiah, <b>as it is written: “Behold, I will return the shadow of the dial, which descended on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which it had gone down”</b> (Isaiah 38:8). Merodach <b>said to</b> his servants: <b>What is this</b> wonder that the day was extended? <b>They said to him: Hezekiah fell ill and recovered,</b> and the sun shone for him. Merodach <b>said: There is a man like that and I do not need to send him greetings?</b> The ministers of Merodach <b>wrote to</b> Hezekiah: <b>Greetings to King Hezekiah, greetings to the city of Jerusalem,</b> and <b>greetings to the great God.</b> |
| Isaiah 38:12 | “He will cut me off from the illness [ middalla ]” | Nedarim 40a:4 | <b>Rav said: Anyone who visits the ill is spared from the judgment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is he that considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the day of evil”</b> (Psalms 41:2). In this verse, the term <b>poor [<i>dal</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>ill, as it is stated</b> in the prayer of Hezekiah when he was ill: <b>“He will cut me off from the illness [<i>middalla</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 38:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be derived <b>from this verse</b> in which Jonadab asked his sick friend Amnon, son of King David: “<b>Why, son of the king, are you so sick [<i>dal</i>] from morning to morning?”</b> (II Samuel 13:4). <b>And</b> the term <b>evil means nothing other</b> than <b>Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord made everything for His own purpose, and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), and the ultimate punishment of the evildoer is Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 38:14 | [ delu’im ] | Berakhot 56b:14 | <b>The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [<i>kaneh</i>] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [<i>kene</i>] wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). One who sees several <b>reeds [<i>kanim</i>] should expect understanding, as it said: “Yea, with all your acquisitions [<i>kinyanekha</i>] acquire understanding”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Pumpkin [<i>kara</i>], heart of palm [<i>kura</i>], wax [<i>kira</i>], and reed [<i>kanya</i>], are all advantageous when one dreams</b> about them. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A pumpkin is only shown</b> in a dream <b>to one who fears Heaven with all his might,</b> because pumpkins <b>[<i>delu’im</i>]</b> are interpreted as an acronym for <i>dalu einai lamarom</i>, “My eyes were raised on high” (Isaiah 38:14). |
| Isaiah 38:16 | You will recover me [ vataḥlimeni ], and make me to live” | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream.</b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses:</b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written:</b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 38:16 | A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [ vataḥalimeni ], and make me to live” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 38:16 | “The Lord is upon them, they will live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; and have me recover, and make me to live” | Menachot 44b:1 | <b>“The Lord is upon them, they will live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; and have me recover, and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). This is interpreted as referring to those who don phylacteries, which contain the name of the Lord, on their heads; as a result, they will live, be healed and merit long life. |
| Isaiah 38:17 | that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; | Berakhot 10b:13 | <b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3). When God answered his prayers, <b>it was based upon the merit of others</b> with no mention made of Hezekiah’s own merit, <b>as it is stated: “And I will protect this city to save it, for My sake and for the sake of David, My servant”</b> (II Kings 19:34). <b>And that is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness;</b> but You have, in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back” (Isaiah 38:17)? This verse teaches that <b>even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent him peace</b> and told him that he would recover from his illness, <b>it was bitter for him,</b> because God did not take his merit into consideration. |
| Isaiah 39:1 | as it is written: “At that time Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylonia, sent a letter | Sanhedrin 96a:10 | The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>these four paces</b> of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>what is</b> the incident to which the Gemara alludes? The Gemara answers that the incident is <b>as it is written: “At that time Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylonia, sent a letter</b> and a gift to Hezekiah, as he had heard that he had been ill and was recovered” (Isaiah 39:1). The Gemara asks: <b>Due to</b> the fact that <b>Hezekiah had been ill and was recovered, he sent him a letter and a gift?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> and he did so in order <b>“to inquire of the wonder that was in the land”</b> (II Chronicles 32:31). <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> On <b>that day that</b> Hezekiah’s father, <b>Ahaz, died,</b> daylight lasted <b>two hours,</b> ten hours shorter than the standard day, so that the wicked Ahaz would be buried hurriedly, without the pomp typically accorded kings. |
| Isaiah 39:2 | “And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them his treasury [ beit nekhoto ], the silver and the gold, and the spices and the precious ointment” | Sanhedrin 104a:11 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them his treasury [<i>beit nekhoto</i>], the silver and the gold, and the spices and the precious ointment”</b> (Isaiah 39:2), <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>beit nekhoto</i>?</b> It means that <b>his wife,</b> who typically did not appear before strangers for reasons of modesty, <b>poured</b> drinks <b>for them. And Shmuel says:</b> It means that <b>he showed them his</b> actual <b>treasury. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It means that <b>he showed them a weapon</b> so powerful that <b>it breaks</b> another <b>weapon.</b> |
| Isaiah 39:6 | nothing [ davar ] shall be left, says the Lord” | Yoma 53b:15 | Likewise, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The Ark was exiled to Babylonia, as it is stated:</b> “Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored until this day, shall be carried to Babylonia; <b>nothing [<i>davar</i>] shall be left, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 39:6). <b>These are the Ten Commandments [<i>dibrot</i>] that are inside it;</b> they too shall not be left behind. |
| Isaiah 39:7 | “And of your sons that shall issue from you, they shall be taken away; and they shall be officers [ sarisim ] in the palace of the king of Babylonia” | Sanhedrin 93b:12 | Isaiah prophesied to Hezekiah: <b>“And of your sons that shall issue from you, they shall be taken away; and they shall be officers [<i>sarisim</i>] in the palace of the king of Babylonia”</b> (Isaiah 39:7). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>sarisim</i>? Rav says:</b> It means <b>literally eunuchs,</b> whom the Babylonians castrated to render them suitable for employment in all aspects of the king’s service. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It means <b>that idol worship was emasculated during their lifetime,</b> as it became clear to all that it lacks substance. |
| Isaiah 40:4 | up, as it is stated: “Every valley shall be exalted” | Eruvin 54a:25 | <b>And if he becomes haughty, the Holy One, Blessed be He, lowers him, as it is stated: “And from Bamoth to the valley.” And if he repents, the Holy One, Blessed be He, raises him</b> back <b>up, as it is stated: “Every valley shall be exalted”</b> (Isaiah 40:4). |
| Isaiah 40:4 | as it is stated: “Every valley shall be lifted” | Nedarim 55b:1 | <b>as it is stated: “Every valley shall be lifted”</b> (Isaiah 40:4). When Rav Yosef heard that interpretation, he understood that Rava was aware of the error of his ways in acting arrogantly toward his teacher, and was pacified by Rava’s display of humility. |
| Isaiah 40:12 | And it is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span, | Eruvin 21a:18 | In order to determine the measure of God’s cubit, the Gemara cites a verse that describes the size of the span between God’s thumb and little finger, in a manner of speaking. <b>And it is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12). If the entire world measures one square span, which is a quarter of one square cubit, <b>we find</b> according to this calculation that <b>the entire world is one</b> part <b>in three thousand and two hundred of the Torah.</b> |
| Isaiah 40:12 | But wasn’t it already stated: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span, | Sanhedrin 100a:15 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give each and every righteous person His handful, as it is stated: “Blessed be the Lord, Who day by day bears our burden; God is our salvation, Selah”</b> (Psalms 68:20). <b>Abaye said to him: And is it possible to say so,</b> that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will give them His handful? <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12)? And if the span of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is as great as the heavens, how can a person receive a handful from the Holy One, Blessed be He? |
| Isaiah 40:12 | a person gives his handful to a pauper in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, gives him His handful in the World-to-Come? But isn’t it written: “And meted out heaven with the span” | Sanhedrin 100a:18 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>And is it possible to say that</b> if <b>a person gives his handful to a pauper in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, gives him His handful in the World-to-Come? But isn’t it written: “And meted out heaven with the span”</b> (Isaiah 40:12)? He asked how one can receive so bountiful a reward. Rabbi Meir answered him: <b>And you do not say so? Which</b> of God’s <b>attributes is greater?</b> Is <b>the attribute of reward greater or</b> is <b>the attribute of punishment</b> greater? |
| Isaiah 40:12 | in water, but isn’t it written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand” | Sanhedrin 39a:14 | <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu: Your God is a priest, as it is written: “That they take for Me an offering [<i>teruma</i>]”</b> (Exodus 25:2), and <i>teruma</i> is given to the priests. He asked, sarcastically: <b>When He buried Moses, in what</b> ritual bath <b>did He immerse?</b> A priest who contracts impurity from a corpse must immerse in order to be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if you would say</b> that He immersed <b>in water, but isn’t it written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand”</b> (Isaiah 40:12), that all waters of the world fit in the palm of God, so He could not immerse in them. |
| Isaiah 40:17 | What is your greatness? You are also mixed together with us, as it is written: “All nations before Him are as nothing; | Sanhedrin 39a:16 | <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Avina: It is written: “And who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the earth”</b> (II Samuel 7:23). The heretic asked: <b>What is your greatness? You are also mixed together with us, as it is written: “All nations before Him are as nothing;</b> they are counted by Him less than nothing and vanity” (Isaiah 40:17). Rabbi Avina <b>said to him: One of yours,</b> the gentile prophet Balaam, <b>has</b> already <b>testified for us, as it is written:</b> |
| Isaiah 40:22 | evening, and renews the act of Creation daily, as it is stated: “Who stretches out the heavens as a curtain [ Vilon ], and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in” | Chagigah 12b:5 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> There are <b>seven</b> firmaments, <b>and they are as follows: <i>Vilon</i>, <i>Rakia</i>, <i>Sheḥakim</i>, <i>Zevul</i>, <i>Ma’on</i>, <i>Makhon</i>,</b> and <b><i>Aravot</i>.</b> The Gemara proceeds to explain the role of each firmament: <b><i>Vilon</i>,</b> curtain, is the firmament that <b>does not contain anything, but enters at morning and departs</b> in the <b>evening, and renews the act of Creation daily, as it is stated: “Who stretches out the heavens as a curtain [<i>Vilon</i>], and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in”</b> (Isaiah 40:22). <b><i>Rakia</i>,</b> firmament, is the one <b>in which</b> the <b>sun, moon, stars, and zodiac signs are fixed, as it is stated: “And God set them in the firmament [<i>Rakia</i>] of the heaven”</b> (Genesis 1:17). <b><i>Sheḥakim</i>,</b> heights, is the one <b>in which mills stand and grind manna for the righteous, as it is stated: “And He commanded the heights [<i>Sheḥakim</i>] above, and opened the doors of heaven; and He caused manna to rain upon them for food,</b> and gave them of the corn of heaven” (Psalms 78:23–24). |
| Isaiah 40:22 | heavens [ bedok ], | Shabbat 104a:11 | <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>the attribute of the righteous</b> it is taught differently. <b><i>Alef tav</i>, <i>beit shin</i>: If you have shame [<i>ata bosh</i>], <i>gimmel reish</i>, <i>dalet kuf</i>: If you do so,</b> you will <b>reside [<i>gur</i>] in</b> the <b>heavens [<i>bedok</i>],</b> as the verse says: “Who stretches out the Heavens like a curtain [<i>dok</i>]” (Isaiah 40:22). <b><i>Heh tzadi</i>, <i>vav peh</i>: There is a partition [<i>ḥatzitza havei</i>] between you and anger [<i>af</i>]. <i>Zayin ayin</i>, <i>ḥet samekh</i>, <i>tet nun</i>: And you will not be shaken [<i>mizdaze’a</i>] by the Satan. <i>Yod mem</i>, <i>kaf lamed</i>: The minister of Gehenna said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> send the righteous as well into the <b>sea</b> to which <b>all</b> go <b>[<i>yam kol</i>],</b> Gehenna. |
| Isaiah 40:24 | through their noses and they died, as it is stated: “When he blows upon them, and they wither” | Sanhedrin 95b:12 | <b>And there are those who say:</b> The angel <b>blew into</b> the soldiers of the Assyrian army <b>through their noses and they died, as it is stated: “When he blows upon them, and they wither”</b> (Isaiah 40:24). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> The angel <b>clapped his hands to them and they died, as it is stated: “I will also strike My hands together and I will assuage My anger”</b> (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: He revealed ears for them and they</b> were able to <b>hear the songs</b> of praise <b>from the mouths of the</b> celestial <b>creatures</b> drawing the chariot of God, <b>and they died, as it is stated: “From Your exaltation the nations were scattered”</b> (Isaiah 33:3), indicating that their death was caused by the revelation of God’s greatness. |
| Isaiah 40:28 | “Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint or weary? His discernment is beyond comprehension” | Taanit 2a:10 | Rabba bar Sheila elaborates on this verbal analogy. <b>It is written here: “Who does great things that are beyond comprehension,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the creation of the world: <b>“Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint or weary? His discernment is beyond comprehension”</b> (Isaiah 40:28). This shows that both creation and rainfall are beyond comprehension. <b>And</b> concerning the creation of the world, <b>it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Who sets firm the mountains with Your strength; Who is girded with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7). From this verse it can be inferred that rainfall, like the creation of the world, reflects God’s might. |
| Isaiah 40:28 | His discernment is past finding out” | Taanit 9b:13 | <b>As it is stated,</b> with regard to the creation of the world: <b>“Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10), <b>and</b> as an example of this <b>it is written: “Who gives rain upon the earth”</b> (Job 5:9–10). <b>And it is written below: “Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord,</b> the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint and is not weary; <b>His discernment is past finding out”</b> (Isaiah 40:28). The repetition of “past finding out” indicates that rainfall is as wondrous as the creation of the world. The Gemara adds: <b>And it is written</b> in a psalm that deals with rainfall: <b>“Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains;</b> Who is girded about with might” (Psalms 65:7). |
| Isaiah 40:31 | “But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength” | Kiddushin 82a:10 | The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result. |
| Isaiah 40:31 | “But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength” | Kiddushin 82b:5 | The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades</b> and I teach my son only Torah. It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:14): <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as all other trades serve one only in the days of his youth,</b> when he has enough strength to work, <b>but in the days of his old age, behold, he</b> is left to <b>lie in hunger. But Torah is not like this: It serves a person in the time of his youth and provides him with a future and hope in the time of his old age. With regard to the time of his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to</b> the time of <b>his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be full of sap and richness”</b> (Psalms 92:15). |
| Isaiah 40:31 | the verse states: “But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not tire” | Sanhedrin 92b:1 | <b>And if you say:</b> During <b>those years when the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to renew His world, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), <b>what are the righteous</b> to <b>do?</b> How will they survive? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>make wings like eagles for them and</b> they will <b>fly over the surface of the water, as it is stated: “Therefore, we will not fear when God changes the land, and when the mountains are moved in the midst of the sea”</b> (Psalms 46:3). Although God will renew the land, they will not fear, because they will be in the sky over the sea at that time. <b>And lest you say</b> that they will endure <b>suffering</b> from flying uninterrupted for an extended period, <b>the verse states: “But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not tire”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). |
| Isaiah 41:2 | and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [ mizraḥ ], whom righteousness | Bava Batra15a:9 | It is further stated that <b>David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders,</b> whom the <i>baraita</i> proceeds to list. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let it also count Ethan the Ezrahite</b> among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <b>Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is</b> the same person as <b>Abraham.</b> Proof for this is the fact that <b>it is written here:</b> “A Maskil of <b>Ethan the Ezrahite”</b> (Psalms 89:1), <b>and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [<i>mizraḥ</i>], whom righteousness</b> met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse. |
| Isaiah 41:2 | and it is written: “Who has raised up one from the east at whose steps victory attends? He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; his sword makes them as the dust, his bow as driven straw” | Sanhedrin 108b:21 | § <b>Rav Ḥana bar Leva’ei says</b> that <b>Shem the Great said to Eliezer,</b> servant of Abraham: <b>When</b> the four great <b>kings of the east and the west came upon you</b> to wage war with Abraham, <b>what did you do?</b> Eliezer <b>said to him: The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought Abraham and placed him to His right, and we would throw dust and it became swords,</b> and we threw <b>straw and it became arrows, as it is stated: “A Psalm of David. The Lord says to my master: Sit to My right, until I make your enemies your footstool”</b> (Psalms 110:1), <b>and it is written: “Who has raised up one from the east at whose steps victory attends? He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; his sword makes them as the dust, his bow as driven straw”</b> (Isaiah 41:2). |
| Isaiah 41:2 | “Who has raised up one from the east, he will call justice [ tzedek ] to his steps [ leraglo ]. | Shabbat 156b:1 | Is it <b>because Jupiter is</b> situated <b>in the west</b> that you cannot have children? <b>I will restore</b> it <b>and establish</b> it <b>in the east. And that is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“Who has raised up one from the east, he will call justice [<i>tzedek</i>] to his steps [<i>leraglo</i>].</b> He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; his sword makes them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble” (Isaiah 41:2). God established Jupiter [<i>tzedek</i>] in the east on behalf of [<i>leraglo</i>] Abraham. |
| Isaiah 41:2 | “His sword makes them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble” | Taanit 21a:12 | <b>When he arrived there,</b> at the ruler’s palace, <b>they opened the chest</b> and <b>saw that it was filled with earth. The king wished to put all</b> the Jewish emissaries <b>to death. He said: The Jews are mocking me.</b> Naḥum of Gam Zu <b>said: This too is for the good. Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>came and appeared before</b> the ruler <b>as one of</b> his ministers. He <b>said to</b> the ruler: <b>Perhaps this earth is from the earth of their father Abraham. As when he threw earth, it turned into swords,</b> and when he threw <b>stubble, it turned into arrows, as it is written</b> in a prophecy that the Sages interpreted this verse as a reference to Abraham: <b>“His sword makes them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble”</b> (Isaiah 41:2). |
| Isaiah 41:8 | As it is written: “The offspring of Abraham who loved Me” | Sotah 31a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Abraham himself, from where do we</b> derive that he acted out of a sense of love? <b>As it is written: “The offspring of Abraham who loved Me”</b> (Isaiah 41:8). |
| Isaiah 41:15 | “Behold, I have made you a new threshing board [ morag ] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff” | Avodah Zarah24b:5 | Tangentially, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>“<i>morigim</i>,”</b> mentioned in this verse? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>a <i>turbil</i> bed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>turbil</i> bed?</b> It is <b>a serrated board [<i>kurkesa</i>]</b> used <b>for threshing. Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which the meaning of <i>morigim</i> is derived? It is derived from the verse: <b>“Behold, I have made you a new threshing board [<i>morag</i>] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff”</b> (Isaiah 41:15). |
| Isaiah 41:15 | “Behold, I have made you a new threshing sledge [ morag ] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains” | Menachot 22a:5 | Tangentially, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>morigim</i></b> mentioned in this verse? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed.</b> This was not a known expression in Babylonia, so the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed? Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is referring to <b>a serrated [<i>dekurkesa</i>] board that the threshers use for threshing,</b> which is dragged over the grain by an animal in order to separate the kernels from the stalks. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which the meaning of <i>morigim</i> is derived? It is the verse that states: <b>“Behold, I have made you a new threshing sledge [<i>morag</i>] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains”</b> (Isaiah 41:15). |
| Isaiah 41:15 | “Behold, I have made you a new threshing board [ morag ] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff” | Zevachim 116b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are <b>“the threshing instruments [<i>morigim</i>]”</b> mentioned in the verse? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed? Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a heavy, serrated board [<i>dekurkesa</i>],</b> used <b>for threshing. Abaye said: What is the verse</b> from which the meaning of <i>morigim</i> is derived? <b>“Behold, I have made you a new threshing board [<i>morag</i>] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff”</b> (Isaiah 41:15). This verse indicates that a <i>morag</i> has grooves and teeth, and is used for threshing. |
| Isaiah 41:16 | “ Tizrem veruaḥ tissa’em ” | Avodah Zarah44a:9 | Rabbi Yosei <b>said to</b> the Rabbis, citing another proof for his opinion: <b>But isn’t it already stated: “And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away [<i>vayyissa’em</i>]”</b> (II Samuel 5:21)? <b>And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that</b> the meaning of <b>this formulation: “<i>Vayyissa’em</i> David,” is winnowing,</b> i.e., scattering in the wind? It is <b>as Rav Yosef translates</b> the verse: <b>“<i>Tizrem veruaḥ tissa’em</i>”</b> (Isaiah 41:16), <b>and we translate</b> it as follows: <b>“You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry them</b> away.” Apparently, this way of disposing of idolatrous objects is sufficient. |
| Isaiah 41:19 | the school of Rav: There are ten types of cedars; as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [ erez ], the acacia tree [ shitta ], and the myrtle [ hadas ] and the pine tree [ etz shemen ]; I will set | Bava Batra80b:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, with what are we are dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with other types of cedars,</b> as the trunks of certain species do not grow back after the tree is felled. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>they say</b> in <b>the school of Rav: There are ten types of cedars; as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [<i>erez</i>], the acacia tree [<i>shitta</i>], and the myrtle [<i>hadas</i>] and the pine tree [<i>etz shemen</i>]; I will set</b> in the desert the juniper [<i>berosh</i>], the teak [<i>tidhar</i>], and the cypress [<i>te’ashur</i>] all together” (Isaiah 41:19). The Gemara elaborates: <b><i>Erez</i></b> means <b>cedar; <i>shitta</i></b> means <b>acacia tree [<i>tornita</i>]; <i>hadas</i></b> is the <b>myrtle; <i>etz shemen</i></b> is the <b>balsam tree; <i>berosh</i></b> means <b>juniper [<i>berati</i>]; <i>tidhar</i></b> is the <b>teak [<i>shaga</i>]; and <i>te’ashur</i></b> is the <b>cypress [<i>shurbina</i>].</b> |
| Isaiah 41:19 | by the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree | Rosh Hashanah23a:11 | With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Each and every acacia tree that the gentiles took from Jerusalem will be returned to</b> the city <b>by the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree</b> and myrtle and the oil tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree and the larch together” (Isaiah 41:19). <b>And</b> the term <b>wilderness</b> is referring to <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Zion is become a wilderness,</b> Jerusalem a desolation” (Isaiah 64:9). |
| Isaiah 41:19 | they say in the school of Rav: There are ten species of cedar, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree and myrtle and the pine tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree, and the larch together” | Rosh Hashanah23a:6 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this opinion of Rav Yehuda <b>disagrees with</b> that of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rav: There are ten species of cedar, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree and myrtle and the pine tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree, and the larch together”</b> (Isaiah 41:19). The seven species mentioned in this verse are all types of cedars. The Gemara proceeds to identify these trees by their Aramaic names: <b>Cedar is <i>arza</i>, acacia is <i>tornita</i>, myrtle is <i>asa</i>, pine tree is <i>afarsema</i>, cypress is <i>berata</i>, maple is <i>shaga</i>,</b> and <b>box tree is <i>shorivna</i>.</b> |
| Isaiah 41:19 | they say in the school of Rav: There are ten types of erez , as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [ erez ], the acacia-tree, the myrtle, | Sukkah 37a:4 | The Gemara responds: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>erez</i></b> to which the mishna refers? It is in fact a <b>myrtle</b> tree, <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> said, <b>as Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rav: There are ten types of <i>erez</i>, as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [<i>erez</i>], the acacia-tree, the myrtle,</b> and pine tree; I will set in the plain the juniper, the box-tree, and the cypress all together” (Isaiah 41:19). All the trees listed in this verse are types of cedar, and the myrtle is one of them. |
| Isaiah 41:19 | Rabba bar Huna, as Rabba bar Huna said: There are ten species of cedars, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree and myrtle | Taanit 25b:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? With other species of cedars.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Huna, as Rabba bar Huna said: There are ten species of cedars, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree and myrtle</b> and the oil tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree and the larch together” (Isaiah 41:19). The seven species mentioned in this verse are all called cedars, as are three additional species. |
| Isaiah 41:27 | Behold, behold them; | Pesachim 5a:15 | The <i>tanna</i> provides the sources for his statement. <b>To eradicate the descendants of Esau, as it is written: “And the first [<i>harishon</i>] came forth red, all over like a hairy mantle;</b> and they called his name Esau” (Genesis 25:25). <b>And to the construction of the Temple, as it is written:</b> “The <b>Throne of Glory, on High from the beginning [<i>merishon</i>], the place of our Temple”</b> (Jeremiah 17:12). <b>And</b> the Jewish people were also entitled <b>to the name of Messiah, as it is written: “A harbinger [<i>rishon</i>] to Zion</b> I will give: <b>Behold, behold them;</b> and to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings” (Isaiah 41:27). However, <i>harishon</i> stated with regard to Passover is referring to the day before the Festival. |
| Isaiah 42:3 | rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Isaiah 42:3 | they said to you as follows: “A bruised reed he shall not break and the dimly burning wick he shall not quench; | Yevamot 93b:2 | Rabbi Ḥiyya said to him: <b>No;</b> The dream referred to a different verse, one that deals with the Messiah, as <b>they said to you as follows: “A bruised reed he shall not break and the dimly burning wick he shall not quench;</b> according to truth he shall bring forth justice” (Isaiah 42:3). In other words, Rabbi Yannai acted correctly, in accordance with the ways of truth. This exchange shows that both Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yannai agree that an entity not in the world can be acquired. |
| Isaiah 42:5 | “Who creates [ boreh ] the heavens and stretches them out” | Berakhot 52b:29 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>? In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: <b>“Who forms light and creates [<i>boreh</i>] darkness”</b> (Isaiah 45:7), <b>“Who forms mountains and creates [<i>boreh</i>] wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), or <b>“Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the heavens and stretches them out”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). <b>Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both <i>bara</i> and <i>boreh</i>, everyone agrees that</b> they <b>mean created. Where they disagree is with regard to the light</b> of the fire or <b>the lights</b> of the fire. <b>As Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>there is one light in a fire, and Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there are many lights in a fire,</b> as a flame consists of red, green, and white light. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: There are many lights in the fire.</b> |
| Isaiah 42:5 | “He gives breath to the people upon it, and spirit to they who walk there” | Ketubot 111a:18 | Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba bar Memel: <b>My teacher, I teach</b> it from <b>a different verse,</b> as it is stated: <b>“He gives breath to the people upon it, and spirit to they who walk there”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). This indicates that the future resurrection is specifically for those who dwell in Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Abba retorted: <b>But isn’t it written: “My dead bodies shall arise”?</b> How do you interpret this verse? Rabbi Elazar replied: <b>That</b> verse is not referring to those living outside Eretz Yisrael; rather, <b>it is written</b> with regard to <b>stillborns,</b> as they too will merit resurrection. |
| Isaiah 42:5 | “And spirit to they who walk there” | Ketubot 111a:20 | With regard to the aforementioned verse <b>“And spirit to they who walk there”</b> (Isaiah 42:5), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who walks four cubits in Eretz Yisrael is assured of</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Isaiah 42:13 | nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord will go forth as a mighty man, | Arakhin 15b:15 | Mar Ukva continued: <b>And</b> the word <b>“mighty” in</b> Psalms 120:4 means <b>nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord will go forth as a mighty man,</b> He will stir up jealousy like a man of war; He will cry; He will shout aloud, He will prove Himself mighty against His enemies” (Isaiah 42:13). And as for the <b>coals of</b> the <b>broom</b> tree [<b><i>gaḥalei retamim</i></b>] that burn for a long time, <b>this is</b> an allusion to <b>Gehenna.</b> |
| Isaiah 42:14 | “I have long time held My peace, I have been still, and refrained Myself; | Avodah Zarah3b:10 | <b>Rather,</b> you might suggest that the source is <b>that it is written: “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you”</b> (Psalms 137:5–6). This is also inconclusive, as <b>perhaps there is no forgetting</b> of Jerusalem for God, <b>but in any event there is</b> still <b>making sport. Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from this</b> verse: <b>“I have long time held My peace, I have been still, and refrained Myself;</b> now will I cry like a travailing woman, gasping and panting at once” (Isaiah 42:14). |
| Isaiah 42:21 | to make Torah great and glorious” | Chullin 66b:5 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said, and so the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> taught: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wished to bestow good upon the Jewish people. Therefore, He made their Torah abundant, as it is written: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, <b>to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21). He consequently expanded some aspects of the Torah more than strictly necessary. |
| Isaiah 42:21 | as it is stated: “It pleased the Lord for the sake of His righteousness to make the Torah great and glorious” | Makkot 23b:3 | <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akashya says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to confer merit upon the Jewish people; therefore, He increased for them Torah and mitzvot,</b> as each mitzva increases merit, <b>as it is stated: “It pleased the Lord for the sake of His righteousness to make the Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21). God sought to make the Torah great and glorious by means of the proliferation of mitzvot. |
| Isaiah 42:21 | as it is written: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, to make Torah great and glorious” | Megillah 27a:3 | The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>The one who said</b> that the reference is to where the <b>Torah</b> is made great bases his opinion on a verse that describes Torah study as great, <b>as it is written: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21). <b>And the one who said</b> that the reference is to where <b>prayer</b> is made great bases his opinion on a verse that describes prayer as great, <b>as it is written: “Tell me,</b> I pray you, all <b>the great things that Elisha has done”</b> (II Kings 8:4), <b>and that which Elisha did,</b> i.e., restored a boy to life, <b>he did through prayer.</b> |
| Isaiah 42:21 | to make Torah great and glorious” | Niddah 51b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if there is proof that <i>kaskeset</i> means scales, the question returns: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>“scales” and</b> then there would be <b>no need</b> to write <b>“fins.” Rabbi Abbahu says, and likewise</b> a Sage of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that this is in accordance with the verse: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, <b>to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21).In this context, this means that it is fitting for the Torah to state all the characteristics of a kosher animal rather than merely state that which is absolutely necessary. |
| Isaiah 42:24 | “Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?” | Gittin 58a:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Horayot</i> 2:5) relating to the fate of the Jewish children: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya who</b> once <b>went to the great city of Rome,</b> where <b>they said to him: There is a child in prison</b> with <b>beautiful eyes</b> and <b>an attractive appearance, and his curly hair is arranged in locks.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>went and stood by the entrance to the prison. He said,</b> as if speaking to himself: <b>“Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?”</b> (Isaiah 42:24). <b>That child answered by reciting</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“Did not the Lord, He against Whom we have sinned, and in Whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to His law?”</b> |
| Isaiah 43:4 | “Therefore I will give man [ adam ] for you” | Berakhot 62b:6 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar entered a bathroom. This Roman came and pushed him</b> away. <b>Rabbi Elazar stood and left,</b> and <b>a serpent came and ripped out the intestines</b> of the Roman. <b>Rabbi Elazar recited the</b> following <b>verse about</b> the Roman: <b>“Therefore I will give man [<i>adam</i>] for you”</b> (Isaiah 43:4); <b>do not read</b> it as <b><i>adam</i>, but rather read</b> it as <b>Edom,</b> meaning a Roman. |
| Isaiah 43:7 | future, the righteous will be called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him” | Bava Batra75b:3 | <b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will be called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him”</b> (Isaiah 43:7). This indicates that one who was created by God and causes Him glory is called by His name. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three were called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and they are: The righteous, and the Messiah, and Jerusalem.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:7 | they said: Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as it is stated: “Everyone who is called by My name, I have created for My glory” | Yoma 38a:8 | <b>When the Sages heard of the matter</b> that the bread of the imported craftsmen was of lower quality than before, <b>they said: Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as it is stated: “Everyone who is called by My name, I have created for My glory”</b> (Isaiah 43:7). In deference to God, the Sages should diminish their honor for the greater glory of God <b>and</b> let <b>the House of Garmu return to their</b> original <b>station. The Sages sent for them</b> to reassume their previous position, <b>and they did not come. They doubled their wages and they came.

Rabbi Yehuda says: Each day</b> they took <b>twenty-four</b> <i>maneh</i>, <b>and today</b> they take <b>forty-eight.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:9 | is not mistaken, as it is written: “Let them bring their witnesses [ eideihem ], that they may be justified” | Avodah Zarah2a:3 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who teaches <i>eideihen</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> <b>is not mistaken, as it is written: “For the day of their calamity [<i>eidam</i>] is at hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:35), and the future downfall mentioned in the verse is partly due to the festivals of idol worshippers. The term there is spelled with an <i>alef</i>. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>the one who teaches <i>eideihen</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> <b>is not mistaken, as it is written: “Let them bring their witnesses [<i>eideihem</i>], that they may be justified”</b> (Isaiah 43:9), i.e., the festivals will serve as witnesses against gentile sinners, proving that they engaged in idol worship. The term there is spelled with an <i>ayin</i>. |
| Isaiah 43:9 | “And let them hear, and say: It is truth” | Avodah Zarah2a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is this</b> verse: <b>“Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified,” written with regard to the nations of the world? Isn’t it written with regard to the Jewish people? As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: All the mitzvot that the Jews perform in this world</b> will <b>come and bear witness for them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified.” These are the Jews,</b> as their good deeds bear witness for them and demonstrate their righteousness. When the verse states: <b>“And let them hear, and say: It is truth”</b> (Isaiah 43:9), <b>these are the nations of the world,</b> who will admit to the righteousness of the Jews. |
| Isaiah 43:9 | with their scholars, as it is stated: “And let the peoples [ le’umim ] be assembled” | Avodah Zarah2b:1 | <b>with their scholars, as it is stated: “And let the peoples [<i>le’umim</i>] be assembled”</b> (Isaiah 43:9); <b>and</b> the term <b><i>le’om</i></b> means <b>nothing other than kingdom, as it is stated: “And the one kingdom [<i>ule’om</i>] shall be stronger than the other kingdom [<i>mile’om</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:23). The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> it possible for <b>there</b> to be <b>intermingling before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that it should be necessary for each nation to stand and be addressed separately? <b>Rather,</b> the nations are instructed to stand separately <b>so that they will not become intermingled with each other</b> in order <b>that they will</b> each <b>hear what He says to them.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:9 | “And announce to us the first things” | Avodah Zarah2b:16 | <b>Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: The first</b> mitzvot <b>will let us hear</b> the truth, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the same verse under discussion: <b>“And announce to us the first things”</b> (Isaiah 43:9). With regard to the <b>seven</b> Noahide <b>mitzvot</b> that preceded the giving of the Torah <b>that</b> even <b>you accepted, where</b> is the proof that <b>you fulfilled them?</b> |
| Isaiah 43:9 | as it is stated: “Who among them can declare this?” | Avodah Zarah2b:6 | <b>Is there no one among you who can declare</b> that they have studied <b>this</b> Torah? This is the meaning of the continuation of the verse from Isaiah, <b>as it is stated: “Who among them can declare this?”</b> (Isaiah 43:9). <b>And “this”</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> the <b>Torah, as it is stated: “And this is the Torah that Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44), and whoever did not engage in its study does not receive reward. <b>Immediately,</b> the members of the Roman Empire <b>leave disappointed.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:9 | As it is stated: “Who among them can declare this” | Avodah Zarah2b:9 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: Everything that you did, you did for your own needs.

| Isaiah 43:9 | let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified” | Avodah Zarah3a:9 | <b>Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify about Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah that they did not prostrate themselves before</b> a graven <b>image.

As it is stated:</b> “All the nations are gathered together…<b>let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified”</b> (Isaiah 43:9), i.e., the gathered gentiles will submit testimony on behalf of the Jewish people and demonstrate the Jews’ righteousness. |
| Isaiah 43:9 | come and bear witness for them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified, and let them hear, and say: It is truth” | Avodah Zarah4b:15 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: All of the mitzvot that the Jews perform in this word</b> will <b>come and bear witness for them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified, and let them hear, and say: It is truth”</b> (Isaiah 43:9). He explains: <b>“Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified”; these are</b> referring to <b>the Jews. “And let them hear, and say: It is truth”; these are</b> referring to <b>the nations of the world.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:10 | testify against him, as it is stated: “You are My witnesses, says the Lord” | Taanit 11a:10 | <b>Rabbi Ḥidka said: A person’s soul</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “Keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom”</b> (Micah 7:5). <b>And some say: A man’s limbs</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “You are My witnesses, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 43:10). |
| Isaiah 43:12 | And the Sages say: A person’s limbs testify against him, as it is stated: “Therefore you are My witnesses, says the Lord, and I am God” | Chagigah 16a:17 | <b>And the Sages say: A person’s soul</b> shall itself <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “Guard the doors of your mouth from she who lies in your bosom”</b> (Micah 7:5). <b>What thing lies in a person’s bosom?

| Isaiah 43:14 | with them, as it is stated: “For your sake I have sent to Babylonia” | Megillah 29a:4 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Come and see how beloved the Jewish people are before the Holy One, Blessed be He.

They were exiled to Egypt,</b> and <b>the Divine Presence</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt?”</b> (I Samuel 2:27). <b>They were exiled to Babylonia,</b> and <b>the Divine Presence</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “For your sake I have sent to Babylonia”</b> (Isaiah 43:14). <b>So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, the Divine Presence will be with them, as it is stated: “Then the Lord your God will return with your captivity”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:3). <b>It does not state: He will bring back,</b> i.e., He will cause the Jewish people to return, <b>but rather</b> it says: <b>“He will return,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return</b> together <b>with them from among the</b> various <b>exiles.</b> |
| Isaiah 43:16 | as it is stated: “So said the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, | Chullin 139b:8 | <b>Rather,</b> the term <b>“before you”</b> is necessary <b>to include</b> a case <b>where</b> the birds <b>were before you,</b> i.e., they had an owner and were readily available to him, <b>and</b> they then <b>rebelled</b> and fled and nested elsewhere. <b>“On the way”</b> is necessary for <b>that which Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If one <b>found a nest in the sea,</b> e.g., in a case where a tree was washed out to sea with a nest in its branches, one <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> the mother bird away, <b>as it is stated: “So said the Lord, who makes a way in the sea,</b> and a path in the mighty waters” (Isaiah 43:16). The term “way” applies even to the sea. |
| Isaiah 43:18 | “Do not remember the former events, and do not ponder things of old” | Berakhot 13a:1 | <b>not that</b> the name <b>Jacob will be</b> entirely <b>uprooted from its place, but that</b> the name <b>Israel</b> will be the <b>primary</b> name <b>to which</b> the name <b>Jacob</b> will be <b>secondary,</b> as the Torah continues to refer to him as Jacob after this event. <b>And it also says</b> that the ultimate redemption will overshadow the previous redemption in the verse: <b>“Do not remember the former events, and do not ponder things of old”</b> (Isaiah 43:18), and the Gemara explains: <b>“Do not remember the former events,” that is the subjugation to the kingdoms, and “do not ponder things of old,” that is the exodus from Egypt,</b> which occurred before the subjugation to the nations. |
| Isaiah 43:19 | “Behold, I will do new things, now it will spring forth” | Berakhot 13a:2 | With regard to the following verse: <b>“Behold, I will do new things, now it will spring forth”</b> (Isaiah 43:19), <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This refers to the</b> future <b>war of Gog and Magog,</b> which will cause all earlier events to be forgotten. |
| Isaiah 43:20 | But isn’t it written: “The animals of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the benot ya’ana ” | Chullin 64b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “The animals of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the <i>benot ya’ana</i>”</b> (Isaiah 43:20)? <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the term <i>bat ya’ana</i> is referring to <b>an egg, can an egg sing a song</b> of praise to God? <b>Rather,</b> one must say: <b>The <i>ya’ana</i> is written, and the <i>bat ya’ana</i> is</b> also <b>written,</b> and both are acceptable names for this bird. |
| Isaiah 43:22 | with his lips, or gestures with his fingers, the verse says: “And you did not call out to Me, O Jacob” | Yoma 19b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> interrupting in a manner <b>of that sort,</b> by gesturing, <b>permitted</b> during <i>Shema</i>? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta say: One who is reciting <i>Shema</i> should neither make allusions with his eyes, nor open and close</b> his mouth <b>with his lips</b> to convey a message, <b>nor gesture with his fingers? And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma says: Concerning one who recites <i>Shema</i> and makes allusions with his eyes, or opens and closes</b> his mouth <b>with his lips, or gestures with his fingers, the verse says: “And you did not call out to Me, O Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 43:22). By signaling while reciting <i>Shema</i> he behaves contemptuously toward God, and it is tantamount to not having recited <i>Shema</i> before Him. How, then, could Rav gesture while reading <i>Shema</i>? |
| Isaiah 44:9 | from here: “They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall not profit; and their own witnesses [ eideihem ] | Avodah Zarah2a:6 | <b>Rather, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: The one who says</b> that the correct word is <b><i>eideihen</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> derived this use of the term <b>from here: “They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall not profit; and their own witnesses [<i>eideihem</i>]</b> see not, nor know” (Isaiah 44:9). This demonstrates that the objects of idol worship will serve as witnesses against their worshippers. |
| Isaiah 44:25 | Who turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish” | Gittin 56b:2 | Understanding that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai was prepared to ask him not to destroy the Temple, Vespasian <b>said to him: If</b> there is <b>a barrel of honey and a snake [<i>derakon</i>] is wrapped around it, wouldn’t they break the barrel in order to</b> kill <b>the snake?</b> In similar fashion, I am forced to destroy the city of Jerusalem in order to kill the zealots barricaded within it. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>was silent</b> and did not answer. In light of this, <b>Rav Yosef</b> later <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> who applied the verse to Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: “I am the Lord…<b>Who turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish”</b> (Isaiah 44:25). As Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>should have said</b> the following <b>to</b> Vespasian in response: In such a case, <b>we take tongs, remove the snake, and kill it, and</b> in this way <b>we leave the barrel</b> intact. So too, you should kill the rebels and leave the city as it is. |
| Isaiah 44:25 | Who turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish” | Gittin 56b:5 | Vespasian then <b>said to</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>I will be going</b> to Rome to accept my new position, <b>and I will send someone else</b> in my place to continue besieging the city and waging war against it. <b>But</b> before I leave, <b>ask something of me that I</b> can <b>give you.</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Give me Yavne and its Sages</b> and do not destroy it, <b>and</b> spare <b>the dynasty of Rabban Gamliel</b> and do not kill them as if they were rebels, <b>and</b> lastly give me <b>doctors to heal Rabbi Tzadok. Rav Yosef read</b> the following verse <b>about him, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> who applied the verse to Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: “I am the Lord…<b>Who turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish”</b> (Isaiah 44:25), as <b>he should have said to him to leave</b> the Jews alone <b>this time.</b> |
| Isaiah 44:27 | “That says to the deep [ latzula ]: Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers” | Sanhedrin 93a:5 | <b>Once He looked at Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah He was placated, as it is stated: “And he stood among the myrtle bushes [<i>hadassim</i>] that were in the depths [<i>bametzula</i>].” And <i>hadassim</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but the righteous, as it is stated: “And he raised Hadassah,</b> that is Esther, his uncle’s daughter” (Esther 2:7). Hadassah is an appellation for the righteous Esther. <b>And <i>metzula</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> place <b>but Babylonia, as it is stated</b> with regard to the downfall of Babylonia: <b>“That says to the deep [<i>latzula</i>]: Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers”</b> (Isaiah 44:27). <b>Immediately</b> those messengers, in the form of horses, <b>filled with anger</b> and <b>became gray, and</b> those who were <b>red became white. Rav Pappa says: Conclude from it</b> that seeing <b>a white horse</b> in a dream <b>is a good</b> portent <b>for</b> that <b>dream,</b> as it presages peace and quiet. |
| Isaiah 45:1 | which is written: “Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held” | Megillah 12a:5 | Apropos its mention of Cyrus, the Gemara states that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically</b> a verse concerning Cyrus: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held”</b> (Isaiah 45:1), which seemingly is referring to Cyrus as God’s anointed? <b>Now was Cyrus</b> God’s anointed one, i.e., the <b>Messiah,</b> that the verse should refer to him in this manner? <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be understood as God speaking to the Messiah with regard to Cyrus: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Messiah: I am complaining to you about Cyrus,</b> who is not acting in accordance with what he is intended to do. <b>I had said: “He shall build My House and gather My exiles”</b> (see Isaiah 45:13), but he did not carry this out. <b>Rather, he said: “Whoever is among you of all His people…let him go up</b> to Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3). He gave permission to return to Israel, but he did no more than that. |
| Isaiah 45:5 | a’azerkha | Shabbat 103b:6 | The Gemara asks: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> identical to the opinion of the <b>first <i>tanna</i>. And if you say</b> that <b>there is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> their opinions in the case of the letters <b><i>alef alef</i></b> in a word such as <b><i>a’azerkha</i></b> (Isaiah 45:5), in that the <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that if one wrote the letters <b><i>alef alef</i></b> of the word <b><i>a’azerkha</i> he is not liable</b> because the two letters do not spell a complete word, <b>and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>since</b> that combination of letters <b>appears in standard amulets [<i>gelatorei</i>] he is liable</b> because this writing is considered to be enduring; <b>is that to say</b> that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> tends <b>to stringency</b> in this matter? |
| Isaiah 45:7 | “Who forms light and creates darkness, | Berakhot 11b:1 | <b>“Who forms light and creates darkness,</b> Who makes peace and creates evil, I am the Lord Who does all these things” (Isaiah 45:7). |
| Isaiah 45:7 | “Who forms light and creates [ boreh ] darkness” | Berakhot 52b:29 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>? In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: <b>“Who forms light and creates [<i>boreh</i>] darkness”</b> (Isaiah 45:7), <b>“Who forms mountains and creates [<i>boreh</i>] wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), or <b>“Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the heavens and stretches them out”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). <b>Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both <i>bara</i> and <i>boreh</i>, everyone agrees that</b> they <b>mean created. Where they disagree is with regard to the light</b> of the fire or <b>the lights</b> of the fire. <b>As Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>there is one light in a fire, and Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there are many lights in a fire,</b> as a flame consists of red, green, and white light. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: There are many lights in the fire.</b> |
| Isaiah 45:8 | great as the day on which the heavens and earth were created, as it is stated: “Drop down, heavens, from above, let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, the Lord, have created it” | Taanit 7b:2 | § The Gemara returns to the issue of rain. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The day of the rains is</b> as <b>great as the day on which the heavens and earth were created, as it is stated: “Drop down, heavens, from above, let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, the Lord, have created it”</b> (Isaiah 45:8). The Gemara explains that the verse <b>does not say: I have created them,</b> in the plural, <b>but: I have created it.</b> In other words, the verse is referring to rain, rather than to the heavens and the earth, which indicates that rainfall is as important as the creation of the world. |
| Isaiah 45:8 | as it is stated: “Let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation” | Taanit 7b:3 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> likewise <b>said: The day of rain is great, as</b> rain <b>even</b> facilitates <b>salvation,</b> which <b>is fruitful and multiplies on</b> that day. It is a time of God’s favor, when salvation is brought forth into the world, <b>as it is stated: “Let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation”</b> (Isaiah 45:8). <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: Rain falls only if the Jewish people’s transgressions have been forgiven, as it is stated: “Lord, You have been favorable to Your land; You have turned the captivity of Jacob; You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have pardoned all their sin. Selah”</b> (Psalms 85:2–3). This chapter proceeds to discuss rainfall: “And righteousness has looked down from Heaven” (Psalms 85:12), in the form of rain. |
| Isaiah 45:17 | “The Jewish people is saved by the Lord” | Makkot 23b:16 | With regard to <b>Samuel too,</b> no proof may be cited from the use of the singular, as on occasion the <b>entire Jewish people is referred to in the singular, as it is written,</b> e.g.: <b>“The Jewish people is saved by the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 45:17). |
| Isaiah 45:18 | He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Arakhin 2b:15 | <b>Beit Shammai said to them: You have</b> thereby <b>remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who fully derives benefit from all his rights to the slave, <b>but you have not remedied his own</b> situation. How so? <b>He cannot marry a maidservant,</b> as half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He is</b> also <b>unable</b> to marry <b>a free woman,</b> as half of him is still a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle,</b> i.e., refrain from marrying, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated:</b> “For so said the Lord that created the heavens…Who formed the earth and made it, He established it. <b>He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? |
| Isaiah 45:18 | the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Bava Batra13a:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s approach from what is taught in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 41a): <b>One who is half-slave half-freeman,</b> e.g., a slave who had been jointly owned by two people, one of whom emancipated him, <b>serves his master one day and himself one day;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say: You have remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who benefits fully from all his rights to the slave, but <b>you have not remedied his own</b> situation. <b>He cannot marry a maidservant,</b> since half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He is</b> also <b>not able to marry a free woman,</b> since half of him is a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but is it not</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? |
| Isaiah 45:18 | “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Bekhorot 47a:3 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>follow their</b> regular line of <b>reasoning, as it was stated:</b> If a man <b>had children when he</b> was <b>a gentile and he</b> subsequently <b>converted, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He has</b> already <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply, and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> He has <b>not fulfilled</b> the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says he has fulfilled</b> the aspect of the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply expressed in the command: <b>“He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18), i.e., to increase the inhabitation of the world. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says he has not fulfilled</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply,</b> as the halakhic status of <b>a convert who</b> just <b>converted</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a child</b> just <b>born,</b> and it is considered as though he did not have children. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Chagigah 2b:2 | And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? <b>Rather, for the betterment of the world we force his master to make him a freeman, and</b> the slave <b>writes a bill to</b> his master accepting his responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to him. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a half-slave must be set free. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Gittin 41b:1 | <b>It is</b> also <b>not possible</b> for him to marry <b>a free woman, as he is still a half-slave.</b> If you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? <b>Rather, for the betterment of the world his master is forced to make him a freeman, and</b> the slave <b>writes</b> a promissory <b>note</b> accepting his responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to his master. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> that a half-slave must be set free. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | “He created it not a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Megillah 27a:15 | <b>Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that exchanging one entity of <b>Torah,</b> i.e., a Torah scroll, <b>for</b> another entity of <b>Torah,</b> i.e., Torah study, <b>seems well,</b> and by extension, it should be permitted to sell one Torah scroll to purchase another. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Perhaps</b> Torah <b>study is different, as the study</b> of Torah <b>leads to action,</b> i.e., the fulfillment of the mitzvot, and perhaps it is only due to its great importance of Torah study that it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll for it. Similarly, marrying <b>a woman is also</b> of utmost importance, as it is stated with regard to Creation: <b>“He created it not a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18). This indicates that marrying and having children fulfills a primary goal of Creation. <b>But</b> selling an old <b>Torah</b> in order to buy a new <b>Torah</b> might <b>not</b> be permitted. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Pesachim 88b:1 | <b>You have remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who benefits fully from all his rights to the slave, but <b>his own</b> situation <b>you have not remedied.</b> How so? <b>He is not able to marry a maidservant, since half of him is already free,</b> and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He</b> is also <b>not able to marry a free woman, since half of him is still a slave,</b> and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but is it not</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? <b>Rather, for the improvement of the world we force his master to make him a free man, and</b> the slave <b>writes a bill</b> accepting his responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to his master. This was the original version of the mishna. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | we require “He formed it to be inhabited” | Yevamot 62a:17 | The Gemara clarifies the reasons for their opinions: <b>Rav Huna said</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva <b>due to</b> a statement <b>of Rav Asi, as Rav Asi said</b> that the reason for this mitzva is that the Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so, <b>as it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me,</b> and the souls that I have made” (Isaiah 57:16). Consequently, once a child has been born and his soul has entered a body the mitzva has been fulfilled, even if the child subsequently dies. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> he has <b>not fulfilled</b> the mitzva, as <b>we require “He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18), <b>and</b> this <b>is not</b> fulfilled when the children have passed away and no longer inhabit the earth. |
| Isaiah 45:18 | as it is stated: “He did not create it a waste; He formed it to be inhabited” | Yevamot 62a:8 | <b>It is taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The mitzva to be fruitful and multiply is fulfilled with <b>a male and a female. And Beit Hillel say: Either a male or a female. Rava said: What is the reason of Rabbi Natan in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “He did not create it a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18), <b>and one has made</b> the earth <b>inhabited</b> to a greater degree by adding even one child to the world. |
| Isaiah 45:23 | administer an oath to it, as it is stated: “That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear” | Niddah 30b:24 | <b>And</b> a fetus <b>does not leave</b> the womb <b>until</b> the angels <b>administer an oath to it, as it is stated: “That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear”</b> (Isaiah 45:23). The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“That to Me every knee shall bow”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>death, as it is stated: “All those who go down to the dust shall kneel before Him”</b> (Psalms 22:30). <b>“Every tongue shall swear”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>birth, as it is stated</b> in description of a righteous person: <b>“He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not taken My name in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully”</b> (Psalms 24:4), i.e., he has kept the oath that he took before he was born. |
| Isaiah 46:1 | is forbidden except for mockery of idol worship, which is permitted, as it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops” | Megillah 25b:17 | Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman said: All mockery</b> and obscenity <b>is forbidden except for mockery of idol worship, which is permitted, as it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops”</b> (Isaiah 46:1). The prophet mocks these idols by describing them as crouching in order to defecate. Additionally, <b>it is written: “They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden”</b> (Isaiah 46:2). <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> This principle that one is permitted to mock idol worship is derived <b>from here: “The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it”</b> (Hosea 10:5). <b>Do not read</b> it is as <b>“its glory [<i>kevodo</i>],” rather</b> read it as <b>its burden [<i>keveido</i>],</b> meaning that it is unable to restrain itself from defecating. |
| Isaiah 46:1 | As it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops” | Sanhedrin 63b:9 | <b>When Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he lodged in</b> a place called <b>Kalnevo. Rava said to him: And where did the Master lodge?</b> Ulla <b>said to him: In Kalnevo.</b> Rava <b>said to him: But isn’t it written: “And make no mention of the name of the other gods”?</b> Kalnevo is the name of an idol. Ulla <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> object of <b>idol worship that is written in the Torah, it is permitted to mention its name.</b> Since one may mention the idol while reading the Torah, it is permitted to mention it altogether. Rava asked: <b>And where is this</b> idol <b>written?</b> Ulla answered: <b>As it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops”</b> (Isaiah 46:1). |
| Isaiah 46:2 | it is written: “They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden” | Megillah 25b:17 | Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman said: All mockery</b> and obscenity <b>is forbidden except for mockery of idol worship, which is permitted, as it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops”</b> (Isaiah 46:1).

| Isaiah 46:4 | “Even to your old age I am the same; and even to hoar hairs will I suffer you; | Sanhedrin 38b:6 | <b>When</b> history <b>arrived at</b> the time of <b>the people of the generation of the flood and the people of the generation of the dispersion,</b> i.e., the Tower of Babel, <b>whose actions were ruinous,</b> the angels <b>said before God: Master of the Universe, didn’t the</b> first set of angels <b>speak appropriately before You,</b> that human beings are not worthy of having been created? God <b>said to them</b> concerning humanity: <b>“Even to your old age I am the same; and even to hoar hairs will I suffer you;</b> I have made and I will bear; and I will carry, and I will deliver you” (Isaiah 46:4), i.e., having created people, I will even suffer their flaws. |
| Isaiah 46:6 | And in addition, it says: “You who lavish [ hazzalim ] gold out of the bag” | Bava Batra25a:13 | <b>“My speech shall distill [<i>tizzal</i>] as the dew”; this is the northern wind, which</b> brings dry air that reduces the rain and grain and thereby <b>devalues [<i>mazzelet</i>] gold.</b> When grain crops are reduced their price appreciates, and consequently the value of gold decreases. <b>And in addition, it says: “You who lavish [<i>hazzalim</i>] gold out of the bag”</b> (Isaiah 46:6). |
| Isaiah 46:6 | And, in addition, it says: “You who lavish gold out of the bag” | Bava Batra25b:5 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Out of the north comes gold”</b> (Job 37:22)? <b>This is the northern wind, which devalues gold</b> by causing a drought that raises the price of grain. <b>And, in addition, it says: “You who lavish gold out of the bag”</b> (Isaiah 46:6). |
| Isaiah 46:11 | “The man of my counsel from a far country” | Menachot 88b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: The consecration of the quarter-<i>log</i> measuring vessel was necessary, <b>as with it one would measure</b> oil <b>for</b> the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, as <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of oil</b> is used <b>for each and every loaf.</b> In praise for resolving his difficulty, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who had traveled from Babylonia to join Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in Eretz Yisrael: <b>“The man of my counsel from a far country”</b> (Isaiah 46:11). |
| Isaiah 46:12 | “Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity” | Berakhot 17b:2 | Having cited a dispute with regard to the interpretation of a verse where we are uncertain whether the dispute is between Rav and Shmuel or Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar, the Gemara cites another verse with regard to which there is a similar dispute. It is said: <b>“Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity”</b> (Isaiah 46:12). While both agree that the verse refers to the righteous, <b>Rav and Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar,</b> disagreed as to how to interpret the verse. <b>One said: The entire world is sustained by</b> God’s <b>charity,</b> not because it deserves to exist, <b>while</b> the righteous who are far from God’s charity <b>are sustained by force,</b> as due to their own good deeds they have the right to demand their sustenance. <b>And one said: The entire world is sustained by the merit</b> of <b>their</b> righteousness, <b>while they are not sustained</b> at all, <b>not even by their own merit, in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said.</b> |
| Isaiah 47:2 | nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1). |
| Isaiah 47:2 | “Take millstones and grind flour; uncover your locks, tuck up the train, uncover the leg, pass over rivers” | Sanhedrin 96b:4 | <b>He was proceeding and killing until he reached the Sanctuary.</b> When he reached the Sanctuary, <b>he ignited a fire in it. The Sanctuary rose,</b> seeking to enter Heaven so that it would not burn. <b>They trod upon it from Heaven</b> and returned it to its place, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress”</b> (Lamentations 1:15). Nebuzaradan <b>became haughty,</b> taking pride in his conquest. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him:</b> Your haughtiness is unwarranted, as <b>you killed a nation</b> that was already <b>dead, you burned a Sanctuary</b> that was already <b>burned,</b> and <b>you ground flour</b> that was already <b>ground, as it is stated</b> with regard to Babylonia: <b>“Take millstones and grind flour; uncover your locks, tuck up the train, uncover the leg, pass over rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2). <b>It was not stated:</b> Grind <b>wheat, but</b> “grind <b>flour,”</b> indicating that all the destruction had already been wrought by God, and the role played by the enemy was insignificant. |
| Isaiah 47:3 | “Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14).

| Isaiah 48:2 | “The Lord of hosts is His name” | Chagigah 16a:3 | <b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> He expounded the verse: <b>“The Lord of hosts is His name”</b> (Isaiah 48:2); <b>He is the Master in His host.</b> |
| Isaiah 48:10 | which is written: “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction [oni]” | Chagigah 9b:12 | The Gemara relates that <b>Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>said to bar Hei Hei, and some say</b> that he said this <b>to Rabbi Elazar: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction [oni]”</b> (Isaiah 48:10)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought after all good character traits to impart</b> them <b>to the Jewish people, and He found only poverty [<i>aniyut</i>]</b> capable of preventing them from sin. <b>Shmuel said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yosef: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: Poverty is good for the Jewish people like a red bridle [<i>barza</i>] for a white horse.</b> Just as a red bridle accentuates the white color of the horse, so the challenge of poverty draws out the purity of the Jewish people. |
| Isaiah 48:11 | The Divine Spirit responded and said to them: “For My own sake, for My own sake, will I do it” | Pesachim 117a:18 | <b>The Sages taught: This <i>hallel</i>, who</b> initially <b>recited it? Rabbi Eliezer says: Moses and the Jewish people recited it when they stood by the sea. They said: “Not to us, God, not to us,</b> but to Your name give glory” (Psalms 115:1). <b>The Divine Spirit responded and said to them: “For My own sake, for My own sake, will I do it”</b> (Isaiah 48:11). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Joshua and the Jewish people recited it when</b> they defeated <b>the kings of Canaan</b> who <b>stood against them</b> (see Joshua 12:7–24). <b>They said: Not to us, and</b> the Divine Spirit <b>responded:</b> For My own sake. |
| Isaiah 48:11 | for My own sake will I do it; | Sanhedrin 98a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The son of David will come only in a generation that is entirely innocent,</b> in which case they will be deserving of redemption, <b>or</b> in a generation that is <b>entirely guilty,</b> in which case there will be no alternative to redemption. He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely innocent, as it is written: “And your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever”</b> (Isaiah 60:21). He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely guilty, as it is written: “And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor;</b> therefore His arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness, it sustained Him” (Isaiah 59:16). <b>And it is written:</b> “For My own sake, <b>for My own sake will I do it;</b> for how should it be profaned? And My glory I will not give it to another” (Isaiah 48:11). |
| Isaiah 48:13 | this and that were created as one, for it is stated: “Indeed, My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand up together” | Chagigah 12a:17 | <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: According to your words,</b> does <b>a person build a second floor and build</b> the first floor of <b>the house afterward? As it is stated: “It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heaven, and has founded His vault upon the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), indicating that the upper floor, heaven, was built above the earth. <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: According to your words,</b> does <b>a person make a stool</b> for his feet, <b>and make a seat afterward? As it is stated: “So said the Lord: The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> Both <b>this and that were created as one, for it is stated: “Indeed, My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand up together”</b> (Isaiah 48:13), implying that they were created as one. |
| Isaiah 48:13 | Bar Kappara taught: The handiwork of the righteous is greater than the creation of heaven and earth, as with regard to the creation of heaven and earth it is written: “My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spanned the heavens” | Ketubot 5a:11 | § The Gemara cites additional aggadic statements of bar Kappara. <b>Bar Kappara taught: The handiwork of the righteous is greater than the creation of heaven and earth, as with regard to the creation of heaven and earth it is written: “My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spanned the heavens”</b> (Isaiah 48:13). There, hand is written in the singular. <b>Whereas with regard to the handiwork of the righteous it is written: “The place which You have made for Yourself to dwell in, Lord, the Sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17).</b> The reference is to the Temple, which is the handiwork of man, and hand is written in the plural. |
| Isaiah 48:13 | The verse states: “Even My hand [ yadi ] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [ vimini ] has spread out the heavens” | Menachot 36b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And it shall be for a sign for you on <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>left</b> arm. <b>Do you say</b> it means the <b>left</b> arm, <b>or is it only</b> the <b>right</b> arm? <b>The verse states: “Even My hand [<i>yadi</i>] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [<i>vimini</i>] has spread out the heavens”</b> (Isaiah 48:13). <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “Her hand [<i>yadah</i>] she put to the tent pin, and her right hand [<i>viminah</i>] to the workmen’s hammer”</b> (Judges 5:26), <b>and</b> another verse <b>states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [<i>yadkha</i>], even Your right hand [<i>viminekha</i>]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them”</b> (Psalms 74:11). All these verses employ the term <i>yad</i> with regard to the left hand, and use the term <i>yamin</i>, literally, right, without the term <i>yad</i>, to indicate the right hand. |
| Isaiah 48:16 | But isn’t it written: “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret” | Moed Katan16b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret”</b> (Isaiah 48:16), implying that the Torah should be taught and proclaimed in public? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring to <b>the days of the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gathering for Torah study held during Elul and Adar, when many people come to listen to Torah discourses. During this time, it is not only permitted but even recommended to teach Torah to the masses. In this way, the verse can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Isaiah 48:16 | “From the first, I did not speak in concealment” | Shabbat 86b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let them immerse</b> during <b>twilight</b> on Shabbat eve <b>and receive</b> the <b>Torah</b> just after that during <b>twilight.</b> Why was it necessary to delay revelation until Shabbat morning? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that the verse said in that regard: <b>“From the first, I did not speak in concealment”</b> (Isaiah 48:16). God did not give the Torah under the cloak of night, but rather in the light of day. The Gemara asks: <b>And let them immerse themselves on Shabbat morning and receive the Torah on Shabbat morning.</b> In that case, according to all opinions, the period of separation could have begun one twelve-hour period later. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> This was not done <b>so that</b> there would <b>not</b> be a situation where <b>these,</b> one segment of the people, <b>would be going to receive the Torah while those,</b> another segment of the people, <b>would be going to immerse themselves.</b> Optimally, the entire nation should go to receive the Torah together. |
| Isaiah 48:17 | from the Prophets, as it is written: “I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you for your profit, Who leads you on the path that you go” | Makkot 10b:6 | One learns this <b>from the Torah, as it is written</b> that initially God said to Balaam with regard to the contingent dispatched by Balak: <b>“You shall not go with them”</b> (Numbers 22:12). After Balaam implored Him and indicated his desire to go with them, <b>it is written: “Arise, go with them”</b> (Numbers 22:20). One learns this <b>from the Prophets, as it is written: “I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you for your profit, Who leads you on the path that you go”</b> (Isaiah 48:17), indicating that along the path that one seeks to go, God will direct him. One learns this <b>from the Writings, as it is written: “If one seeks the cynics, He will cause him to join the cynics, but to the humble He will give grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34), indicating that if one chooses cynicism God will direct him there and if he opts for humility God will grant him grace. |
| Isaiah 48:22 | to him: “There is no peace, said the Lord, concerning the wicked” | Chagigah 15a:13 | Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir <b>took hold of him</b> and <b>brought him to the study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to a child,</b> by way of divination: <b>Recite your verse</b> that you studied today <b>to me. He recited</b> the following verse <b>to him: “There is no peace, said the Lord, concerning the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 48:22). <b>He brought him to another study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to a child: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “For though you wash with niter, and take for you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22). <b>He brought him to another study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to</b> |
| Isaiah 48:22 | “There is no peace, says the Lord concerning the wicked” | Ketubot 104a:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: At the time when a righteous individual departs from the world, three contingents of ministering angels go out toward him. One says to him: Enter in peace; and one says</b> to him: Each one <b>that walks in his uprightness; and one says to him: He enters in peace, they rest in their beds. At the time when a wicked person perishes from the world, three contingents of angels of destruction go out toward him. One says</b> to him: <b>“There is no peace, says the Lord concerning the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 48:22); <b>and one says to him: “You shall lie down in sorrow”</b> (Isaiah 50:11); <b>and one says to him: “Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised”</b> (Ezekiel 32:19). |
| Isaiah 49:3 | “You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified” | Yoma 86a:12 | <b>Abaye said: As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: <b>“And you shall love the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5), which means <b>that you shall make the name of Heaven beloved.</b> How should one do so? One should do so <b>in that he</b> should <b>read</b> Torah, <b>and learn</b> Mishna, <b>and serve Torah scholars, and he should be pleasant with people in his business transactions. What do people say about</b> such a person? <b>Fortunate is his father who taught him Torah, fortunate is his teacher who taught him Torah, woe to the people who have not studied Torah. So-and-so, who taught him Torah, see how pleasant are his ways, how proper are his deeds. The verse states about him</b> and others like him: <b>“You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified”</b> (Isaiah 49:3). |
| Isaiah 49:7 | Kings shall see and arise, princes shall prostrate themselves, | Sanhedrin 98a:1 | <b>Kings shall see and arise, princes shall prostrate themselves,</b> because of the Lord, Who is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, Who has chosen you” (Isaiah 49:7), indicating that redemption will come independent of repentance? |
| Isaiah 49:7 | to he who is despised of men, to he who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise” | Taanit 15a:1 | <b>to he who is despised of men, to he who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise”</b> (Isaiah 49:7); <b>and ministers by bowing, as it is written,</b> in the same verse: <b>“Ministers, and they shall bow.” Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this</b> interpretation, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> who objected. <b>Had</b> the verse <b>written: And ministers shall bow,</b> the meaning would have been <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “Ministers, and they shall bow,”</b> this indicates that ministers will <b>do this and that,</b> i.e., they will both arise and bow. |
| Isaiah 49:8 | from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you” | Berakhot 8a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that</b> the unique quality of communal prayer is derived <b>from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). |
| Isaiah 49:8 | “In an acceptable time have I answered you” | Sanhedrin 102a:5 | The verse states: <b>“At the time of their punishment, they shall perish”</b> (Jeremiah 51:18). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at the time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“In an acceptable time have I answered you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “in an acceptable time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for good.</b> The verse states: <b>“On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them”</b> (Exodus 32:34). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “on the day when I punish” indicates that <b>it is a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass at that time, and Judah descended from his brothers”</b> (Genesis 38:1). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at that time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> |
| Isaiah 49:10 | as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them” | Bava Kamma92b:2 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated: Awaken early and eat, in the summer due to the heat and in the winter due to the cold. And</b> similarly, <b>people say: Sixty runners run and do not reach the man who ate in the morning.</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10), indicating that one who is not hungry or thirsty will not be affected by the weather. |
| Isaiah 49:10 | as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them” | Bava Metzia107b:10 | Rava bar Mari <b>said to him:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10). Why will <b>the heat and the sun not smite them? Since they shall not hunger nor thirst,</b> as they rose early to eat. |
| Isaiah 49:10 | is privileged and leads them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “For he that has compassion upon them will lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them” | Sanhedrin 92a:6 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any communal leader who leads the community calmly,</b> without anger and honestly, <b>is privileged and leads them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “For he that has compassion upon them will lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10). Just as he led them in this world, so too will he guide them in the World-to-Come. |
| Isaiah 49:16 | a matter that is always visible, as it is stated: “Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands, | Taanit 4a:13 | <b>And</b> the Congregation of Israel <b>further entreated</b> God <b>unreasonably</b> in another context, <b>saying before Him: Master of the Universe: “Set me as a seal upon Your heart, as a seal upon Your arm”</b> (Song of Songs 8:6). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to her: My daughter, you ask</b> that I be manifest to you in <b>a matter that is sometimes visible and sometimes not visible,</b> as the heart and arm are not covered. <b>However, I will act</b> so that I manifest Myself <b>for you</b> like <b>a matter that is always visible, as it is stated: “Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands,</b> your walls are continually before me” (Isaiah 49:16). |
| Isaiah 49:21 | and it is written there: “Then you will say in your heart: Who has begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary [ galmuda ], an exile, and wandering?” | Sotah 42a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any congregation in which there is flattery is ultimately exiled. It is written here: “For a flattering congregation shall be desolate [<i>galmud</i>]”</b> (Job 15:34), <b>and it is written there: “Then you will say in your heart: Who has begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary [<i>galmuda</i>], an exile, and wandering?”</b> (Isaiah 49:21). The verse states: “An exile,” as an appositive to “<i>galmuda</i>,” indicating that they are the same. |
| Isaiah 49:23 | “And kings shall be your foster fathers” | Zevachim 19a:2 | <b>Rav Ashi says: Huna bar Natan said to me: Once, I was standing before Izgadar, king</b> of Persia, <b>and my belt was raised</b> above its appropriate height, <b>and he lowered it</b> into place <b>and said to me: “A kingdom of priests, and a holy nation”</b> (Exodus 19:6), <b>is written about you;</b> therefore, you should always look dignified. <b>When I came before Ameimar</b> and recounted this incident, <b>he said to me: With regard to you,</b> God’s promise to Israel: <b>“And kings shall be your foster fathers”</b> (Isaiah 49:23), <b>was fulfilled.</b> |
| Isaiah 50:1 | The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the prophet: Go say to them: “Where is your mother’s scroll of severance, with which I sent her away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? For your iniquities you sold yourselves and for your transgressions was your mother sent away” | Sanhedrin 105a:3 | <b>Shmuel says</b> that this was the convincing answer: <b>Ten people came and sat before</b> the prophet Ezekiel. <b>He said to them: Repent. They said to</b> Ezekiel: In the case of <b>a slave sold by his owner</b> to another master, <b>or a woman divorced by her husband, does this</b> person <b>have any</b> claim <b>upon that</b> person? Since God gave the Jewish people to other masters, the ties that existed between Him and us were severed. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the prophet: Go say to them: “Where is your mother’s scroll of severance, with which I sent her away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? For your iniquities you sold yourselves and for your transgressions was your mother sent away”</b> (Isaiah 50:1). Learn from this that God did not sever His ties to the Jewish people. |
| Isaiah 50:2 | He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one? When I called, there was no one to answer… | Berakhot 6b:5 | On this same topic, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, enters a synagogue and does not find ten</b> people there, <b>He immediately becomes angry, as it is stated: “Why, when I came, was there no one? When I called, there was no one to answer…</b>Behold, with My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness” (Isaiah 50:2). |
| Isaiah 50:3 | Rav Ḥisda said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the firmament has not been seen in its purity, as it is said: “I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their covering” | Berakhot 59a:15 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> in this they <b>disagree with Rafram bar Pappa</b> who said that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, as Rafram bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the firmament has not been seen in its purity, as it is said: “I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their covering”</b> (Isaiah 50:3). |
| Isaiah 50:10 | as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of His servant? Though he walks in darkness and has no light, | Berakhot 6b:2 | Additionally, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who is accustomed to come to the synagogue and did not come one day, the Holy One, Blessed be He, asks about him,</b> as it were, to determine what happened to him, <b>as it is stated: “Who among you fears the Lord? Who hears the voice of His servant? Though he walks in darkness and has no light,</b> let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God” (Isaiah 50:10). In other words, God asks, who among you fears the Lord yet did not come to hear the voice of His servant the prayer leader, who engages in the service of God? He who went out before dawn and walks in darkness before prayer. |
| Isaiah 50:11 | and one says to him: “You shall lie down in sorrow” | Ketubot 104a:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: At the time when a righteous individual departs from the world, three contingents of ministering angels go out toward him.

| Isaiah 51:1 | from where you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you were dug” | Yevamot 64b:1 | <b>from where you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you were dug”</b> (Isaiah 51:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you”</b> (Isaiah 51:2), which indicates that sexual organs were fashioned for them, signified by the words hewn and dug, over the course of time. |
| Isaiah 51:2 | “Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you” | Yevamot 64b:1 | <b>from where you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you were dug”</b> (Isaiah 51:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you”</b> (Isaiah 51:2), which indicates that sexual organs were fashioned for them, signified by the words hewn and dug, over the course of time. |
| Isaiah 51:6 | as it is stated: “For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment” | Avodah Zarah17a:13 | This statement deeply shocked Elazar ben Durdayya, and <b>he went and sat between two mountains and hills</b> and <b>said: Mountains and hills, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf, so that my repentance will be accepted. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed”</b> (Isaiah 54:10). <b>He said: Heaven and earth, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said</b> to him: <b>Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment”</b> (Isaiah 51:6). |
| Isaiah 51:14 | it is a good omen for him, as it is stated: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; | Berakhot 57a:14 | <b>One who defecates</b> in a dream, <b>it is a good omen for him, as it is stated: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed;</b> and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail” (Isaiah 51:14). The Gemara notes that <b>this only applies</b> where <b>he does not wipe</b> and get his hands dirty. |
| Isaiah 51:14 | Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 51:14 | as the day of death and the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “He who is bent down shall speedily be loosed; | Pesachim 118a:11 | Likewise, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: A person’s orifices,</b> when he cannot properly relieve himself, <b>are as difficult</b> for him <b>as the day of death and the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “He who is bent down shall speedily be loosed;</b> and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail” (Isaiah 51:14). The phrase “dying into the pit” indicates that the opening of the orifices is similar to a rescue from death. <b>And afterward it is written: “Who stirs up the sea, that its waves roar”</b> (Isaiah 51:15), which compares the previous matter to the splitting of the sea. |
| Isaiah 51:15 | And afterward it is written: “Who stirs up the sea, that its waves roar” | Pesachim 118a:11 | Likewise, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: A person’s orifices,</b> when he cannot properly relieve himself, <b>are as difficult</b> for him <b>as the day of death and the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “He who is bent down shall speedily be loosed;</b> and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail” (Isaiah 51:14).

| Isaiah 51:16 | over us, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of my hand” | Chagigah 5b:2 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And I will hide my face in that day”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:18), <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Even though I hid my face from them</b> and My Divine Presence is not revealed, nevertheless: <b>“I speak with him in a dream”</b> (Numbers 12:6). <b>Rav Yosef said: His hand is outstretched,</b> guarding <b>over us, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of my hand”</b> (Isaiah 51:16). |
| Isaiah 51:16 | below, as it is stated: “And I have placed My words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, to plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, | Sanhedrin 99b:11 | <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>as though he built a palace of</b> heaven <b>above and of</b> earth <b>below, as it is stated: “And I have placed My words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, to plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth,</b> and say to Zion, you are My people” (Isaiah 51:16). One who has the word of God placed in his mouth through Torah study has established heaven and earth. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One who engages in Torah study <b>also protects the entire world, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand.” And Levi says: He also advances</b> the coming of <b>the redemption, as it is stated: “And say to Zion, you are My people.”</b> |
| Isaiah 51:20 | about him: “Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net” | Bava Kamma117a:19 | Seeing Rav Kahana’s action, <b>Rav read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net”</b> (Isaiah 51:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this antelope, once it falls into the net,</b> the hunter <b>does not have mercy upon it, so too</b> with regard to <b>the money of a Jew, once it falls into the hand of gentiles, they do not have mercy upon him,</b> i.e., the Jew. Since gentiles who seek a Jew’s money will kill him in order to seize the property, Rav Kahana acted appropriately when he broke the miscreant’s neck, as he protected the Jew’s property and, by extension, the Jew himself. |
| Isaiah 51:21 | exempts the entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine” | Eruvin 65a:1 | <b>I can</b> make an argument that <b>exempts the entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine”</b> (Isaiah 51:21), which teaches that in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, all Jews are considered intoxicated and are not responsible for any sins they commit. |
| Isaiah 52:2 | as it is stated: “Shake yourself from the dust, arise, sit, | Rosh Hashanah31b:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> There are <b>six exiles,</b> if you count only the places, not the number of journeys, and a different verse alludes to this, <b>as it is stated: “For He has brought down those who dwell high, the lofty city laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it to the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:5). This verse mentions six expressions of lowering: Brought down, laying it low, laying it low, to the ground, bringing it, and to the dust. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And from there,</b> i.e., from their lowest place of descent, <b>they are destined to be redeemed</b> in the future, <b>as it is stated: “Shake yourself from the dust, arise, sit,</b> Jerusalem” (Isaiah 52:2). |
| Isaiah 52:3 | “For thus says the Lord, You were sold for naught” | Megillah 24a:4 | We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> when it is being translated, <b>one should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time. <b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> he may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs, he must read</b> them to the translator <b>separately, for example,</b> the verses: <b>“For thus says the Lord, You were sold for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:3); <b>“For thus says the Lord God, at first My people went down to Egypt”</b> (Isaiah 52:4); <b>“Now therefore what have I here, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 52:5). These are three adjacent verses, each one constituting an independent paragraph. |
| Isaiah 52:3 | You were sold for naught, and without money you shall be redeemed” | Sanhedrin 97b:15 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If the Jewish people repent they are redeemed, as it is stated: “Return, wayward children, I will heal your iniquities”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated:</b> “So says the Lord: <b>You were sold for naught, and without money you shall be redeemed”</b> (Isaiah 52:3)? Rabbi Yehoshua explains: <b>“You were sold for naught”</b> means you were sold <b>for idol worship,</b> which is a sin with no basis. <b>“And without money you shall be redeemed”</b> means you will be redeemed <b>not through repentance and good deeds,</b> but through the will of God. |
| Isaiah 52:4 | “For thus says the Lord God, at first My people went down to Egypt” | Megillah 24a:4 | We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> when it is being translated, <b>one should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time. <b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> he may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs, he must read</b> them to the translator <b>separately, for example,</b> the verses: <b>“For thus says the Lord, You were sold for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:3); <b>“For thus says the Lord God, at first My people went down to Egypt”</b> (Isaiah 52:4); <b>“Now therefore what have I here, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 52:5).

| Isaiah 52:5 | And these are they: Exile, Chaldeans, and Ishmaelites, and the evil inclination. Exile, as it is written: “Now therefore, for what am I here, says the Lord, seeing that My people is taken away for naught” | Sukkah 52b:7 | <b>Rav Ḥana bar Aḥa said</b> that the Sages <b>in the school of Rav say:</b> There are <b>four</b> creations that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> created, yet He, as it were, <b>regrets that He created them,</b> as they do more harm than good. <b>And these are they: Exile, Chaldeans, and Ishmaelites, and the evil inclination. Exile, as it is written: “Now therefore, for what am I here, says the Lord, seeing that My people is taken away for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:5). God Himself is asking: For what am I here? <b>Chaldeans, as it is written: “Behold the land of the Chaldeans, this is the people that was not”</b> (Isaiah 23:13), meaning, if only they never were. |
| Isaiah 52:7 | rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Isaiah 52:8 | as it is stated: “Your watchmen, they raise the voice; together shall they sing, | Sanhedrin 91b:17 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is <b>resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Your watchmen, they raise the voice; together shall they sing,</b> for they shall see eye to eye the Lord returning to Zion” (Isaiah 52:8). It <b>is not stated: They sang,</b> in the verse; <b>rather,</b> the term “together <b>shall they sing”</b> is stated. <b>From here resurrection of the dead</b> is derived <b>from the Torah. And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All the prophets are all destined to recite song in one voice, as it is stated: “Your watchmen, they raise the voice; together shall they sing.”</b> |
| Isaiah 53:4 | is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted” | Sanhedrin 98b:14 | Apropos the Messiah, the Gemara asks: <b>What is his name? The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come”</b> (Genesis 49:10). <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [<i>yinnon</i>] as long as the sun;</b> and may men bless themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [<i>ḥanina</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 16:13). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>] that should relieve my soul is far from me”</b> (Lamentations 1:16). <b>And the Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 53:4). |
| Isaiah 53:10 | A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Isaiah 53:10 | Rav Huna said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease; | Berakhot 5a:11 | So too, <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease;</b> to see if his soul would offer itself in guilt, that he might see his children, lengthen his days, and that the desire of the Lord might prosper by his hand” (Isaiah 53:10). This verse illustrates that in whomever God delights, he afflicts with illness. |
| Isaiah 53:10 | one will live a long life, grow, and raise others. | Yoma 88a:11 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: One who sees</b> an emission of <b>semen on Yom Kippur should worry the whole year</b> that perhaps he was given a sign that he and his fast were rejected. <b>But if he survives the year, he can be assured</b> that his good deeds protected him and ensured for him <b>a share</b> in <b>the World-to-Come. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Know</b> that it is so, <b>as the whole world is hungry</b> due to refraining from conjugal relations, <b>and he is satiated</b> since he emitted semen and his lust was subdued. Since the issue was involuntary and not intentional, it is a sign that he has merited divine compassion. <b>When Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael</b> to Babylonia he said: Seeing semen on Yom Kippur is a sign that <b>one will live a long life, grow, and raise others.</b> An allusion to that is the verse: “That he might see his seed and prolong his days” (Isaiah 53:10). |
| Isaiah 53:12 | as it is stated: “Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors” | Sotah 14a:8 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Do you seek</b> to enter the land to perform these mitzvot <b>for any</b> reason <b>other than to receive a reward?

| Isaiah 54:1 | A certain heretic said to Berurya: It is written: “Sing, barren woman who has not given birth, | Berakhot 10a:5 | The Gemara relates an additional example of Berurya’s incisive insight: <b>A certain heretic said to Berurya: It is written: “Sing, barren woman who has not given birth,</b> open forth in song and cry, you did not travail, for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, said the Lord” (Isaiah 54:1). <b>Because she has not given birth,</b> she should <b>sing</b> and rejoice? |
| Isaiah 54:5 | as it is stated: “For your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is His name” | Sanhedrin 22b:3 | <b>Rav Shmuel bar Unya says in the name of Rav: A woman is raw material,</b> like a vessel that has not been completed, <b>and makes a covenant,</b> becoming truly connected, <b>only to the one who made her a vessel</b> through her first act of sexual intercourse, <b>as it is stated: “For your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is His name”</b> (Isaiah 54:5). |
| Isaiah 54:6 | as it is stated: “And a wife from youth, can she be rejected?” | Sanhedrin 22a:22 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: For everything</b> that is lost <b>there is a substitute, except for</b> one’s <b>wife from youth</b> who dies, <b>as it is stated: “And a wife from youth, can she be rejected?”</b> (Isaiah 54:6). <b>Rav Yehuda taught Rav Yitzḥak, his son: A man finds calmness of spirit only from his first wife, as it is stated: “Let your fountain be blessed and have joy with the wife of</b> |
| Isaiah 54:9 | “For this is as the seas of [ ki mei ] Noah to me; as I have sworn | Sanhedrin 99a:11 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The duration of <b>the messianic era is like</b> the duration of the period that runs <b>from the days of Noah until now,</b> i.e., the day when the Messiah will come, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to redemption: <b>“For this is as the seas of [<i>ki mei</i>] Noah to me; as I have sworn</b> that the seas of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you nor rebuke you” (Isaiah 54:9). The words <i>ki mei</i> can be understood as one word, <i>kimei</i>, meaning: Like the days of. |
| Isaiah 54:9 | “As this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; as I have taken an oath | Shevuot 36a:13 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says: No,</b> or any negative expression, can be <b>an oath,</b> and <b>yes,</b> or any positive expression, can be <b>an oath.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Granted</b> that <b>no</b> can be <b>an oath, as it is written: “And the waters shall no more become a flood”</b> (Genesis 9:15). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to that negative commitment: <b>“As this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; as I have taken an oath</b> that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth” (Isaiah 54:9). <b>But from where do we</b> derive the fact that <b>yes</b> can be <b>an oath?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning; from</b> the fact <b>that no</b> can be <b>an oath, yes too</b> can be <b>an oath.</b> |
| Isaiah 54:9 | for the Holy One, Blessed be He, already took an oath that He will not bring a flood upon the world, as it is stated: “For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; | Sotah 11a:10 | <b>Rather, let us come and judge them with water,</b> by drowning the Jewish babies. God will not punish us with water, <b>for the Holy One, Blessed be He, already took an oath that He will not bring a flood upon the world, as it is stated: “For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me;</b> for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth” (Isaiah 54:9). The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Pharaoh’s advisors <b>did not know that He will not bring a flood upon all the world, but He</b> may <b>bring</b> destruction by water <b>upon one nation.</b> |
| Isaiah 54:10 | as it is stated: “For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed” | Avodah Zarah17a:13 | This statement deeply shocked Elazar ben Durdayya, and <b>he went and sat between two mountains and hills</b> and <b>said: Mountains and hills, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf, so that my repentance will be accepted. <b>They said to him: Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed”</b> (Isaiah 54:10). <b>He said: Heaven and earth, pray for mercy on my</b> behalf. <b>They said</b> to him: <b>Before we pray for mercy on your</b> behalf, <b>we must pray for mercy on our own</b> behalf, <b>as it is stated: “For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment”</b> (Isaiah 51:6). |
| Isaiah 54:12 | “And your gates of precious stones” | Bava Batra75a:10 | The Gemara analyzes the rest of that verse: <b>“And your gates of precious stones”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). This should be understood <b>in</b> light of <b>that</b> incident <b>where Rabbi Yoḥanan sat and taught:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will bring precious stones and pearls that are thirty by thirty</b> cubits, <b>and He will hollow out in them</b> a hole of <b>ten by twenty</b> cubits <b>and set them in the gates of Jerusalem. A certain</b> unnamed <b>student sneered at him,</b> saying: <b>Now we do not find</b> precious stones even <b>of</b> the size of <b>an egg of a dove,</b> and yet <b>all of this we will find?</b> |
| Isaiah 54:12 | “And I will make your pinnacles of kadkhod ” | Bava Batra75a:9 | § With regard to the future glory of Jerusalem, the Gemara interprets the verse: <b>“And I will make your pinnacles of <i>kadkhod</i>”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Two angels in heaven, Gabriel and Michael, disagree</b> with regard to the material that will be used to form the walls of Jerusalem. <b>And some say</b> that this dispute is between <b>two <i>amora’im</i> in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael. <b>And who are they?</b> They are <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya. One said</b> they will be made of <b>onyx, and one said</b> of <b>jasper. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Let it be like this [<i>kedein</i>] and like that [<i>ukhedein</i>],</b> i.e., let them be formed from both together. This compromise is indicated by the word <i>kadkhod</i>, a combination of this [<i>kedein</i>] and that [<i>ukhedein</i>]. |
| Isaiah 54:12 | as the gates of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And I will make your pinnacles of rubies and your gates of carbuncles” | Sanhedrin 100a:7 | Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: But isn’t he supporting your</b> statement? He meant no disrespect. <b>Rather, if you heard</b> that at times supporting the statement of a Sage is irreverent, <b>this</b> is what <b>you heard:</b> It is <b>like that</b> case in <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan sat and taught: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to bring precious stones and jewels that are thirty by thirty cubits, and He will bore in them</b> an opening <b>ten</b> cubits wide <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>in height and place them</b> to serve <b>as the gates of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And I will make your pinnacles of rubies and your gates of carbuncles”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). <b>A certain student mocked him</b> and <b>said: Now,</b> at present, <b>we do not find</b> precious stones <b>comparable</b> in size to <b>the egg of a palm dove.</b> Will <b>we find</b> stones <b>as large as</b> those <b>that</b> you described? |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is said: “And all your children [ banayikh ] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children” | Berakhot 64a:13 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is said: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). If all the children of Israel are taught of the Lord, there will be peace for all. |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Ḥanina says: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [ banayikh ] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children [ banayikh ]” | Keritot 28b:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children [<i>banayikh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read: Your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but rather: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>], referring to the scholars who build the world through their Torah study and performance of mitzvot. |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [ banayikh ] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children” | Nazir 66b:4 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read it as: “Your children [<i>banayikh</i>],” but as: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [ banayikh ] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children” | Tamid 32b:6 | The chapter, as well as the talmudic portion of the tractate, concludes with words of praise for those who study Torah. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who occupies</b> himself <b>with Torah at night, the Divine Presence is across from him, as it is stated: “Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord,</b> lift up your hands toward Him” (Lamentations 2:19). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). This can be read as <i>bonayikh</i>, your builders, i.e., scholars build and increase peace for the entire world. |
| Isaiah 54:13 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children” | Yevamot 122b:11 | The tractate finishes on a positive note: <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). This indicates that because the children will be Torah scholars, who are taught of the Lord and His Torah, they will live in great peace, and peace will thereby be increased for the entire world. |
| Isaiah 54:15 | “Behold, they may gather together [ gor yagur ], but without Me; whosoever shall gather together [ gar ] with you shall fall on yours” | Yevamot 24b:8 | <b>The Sages taught: Converts are not accepted in the days of the Messiah. Similarly, they did not accept converts in the days of</b> King <b>David or in the days of</b> King <b>Solomon. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is the verse</b> that hints at this <i>halakha</i>? <b>“Behold, they may gather together [<i>gor yagur</i>], but without Me; whosoever shall gather together [<i>gar</i>] with you shall fall on yours”</b> (Isaiah 54:15). The word <i>gor</i> implies that only a convert [<i>ger</i>] who becomes part of the Jewish people when the Jews are living in exile, at a time when God is not clearly revealed, i.e., “without Me,” are considered part of the Jewish people. <b>But another</b> who wishes to convert in a time when God is clearly revealed shall <b>not</b> be accepted. |
| Isaiah 55:1 | Torah, as it is stated: “Ho, every one that thirsts, come for water” | Avodah Zarah5b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Bana’a: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20)? <b>Happy are you Israel; when they,</b> i.e., the Jewish people, <b>engage in Torah</b> study <b>and in acts of kindness, their</b> evil <b>inclination is given over to them, and they are not given over to their</b> evil <b>inclination, as it is stated: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters.” And</b> the term <b>sowing</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> performing <b>charitable</b> deeds, <b>as it is stated: “Sow to yourselves according to charitableness, reap according to mercy”</b> (Hosea 10:12). <b>And</b> the term <b>waters</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> the <b>Torah, as it is stated: “Ho, every one that thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Isaiah 55:1 | “Ho, all who are thirsty, go to water” | Bava Kamma17a:9 | The Gemara explains how this is derived from the verse: <b>As it is stated: “Happy are you that sow.” And</b> the reference to <b>sowing</b> refers <b>only</b> to acts of <b>charity, as it is stated: “Sow for yourselves for charity, reap according to kindness”</b> (Hosea 10:12). <b>And</b> the reference to <b>water</b> refers <b>only</b> to the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to Torah study: <b>“Ho, all who are thirsty, go to water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Isaiah 55:1 | “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” | Bava Kamma82a:5 | The Gemara discusses the second of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that they should read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Did Ezra institute</b> this practice? <b>But it was instituted from the beginning,</b> i.e., long before his time. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; <b>and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water”</b> (Exodus 15:22). <b>Those who interpret verses</b> metaphorically <b>said</b> that <b>water</b> here is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated</b> metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Isaiah 55:1 | from here: “Come, buy, and eat; and come, buy wine and milk without money and without price” | Bekhorot 6b:18 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that proof may be brought <b>from here:</b> The Torah praises Eretz Yisrael as: <b>“A land flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:17), <b>and if</b> milk <b>was not permitted, would the verse praise</b> the land <b>to us with an item that is not suitable</b> for consumption? <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a proof <b>from here: “Come, buy, and eat; and come, buy wine and milk without money and without price”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Isaiah 55:1 | “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” | Kiddushin 30b:8 | A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: My son, if this wretched one,</b> the evil inclination, <b>encounters you, pull it into the study hall,</b> i.e., go and study Torah. <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt, and if it is iron</b> it will <b>break, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Is not My word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). Just as a stone shatters a hammer, so too one can overcome his evil inclination, which is as strong as iron, through Torah study. With regard to the second part of the statement: <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt,</b> this is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), <b>and it states: “The water wears the stones”</b> (Job 14:19), indicating that water is stronger than stone. |
| Isaiah 55:1 | stone, it will be dissolved, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who is thirsty, come you for the water” | Sukkah 52b:2 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If this scoundrel,</b> the evil inclination, <b>accosted you,</b> seeking to tempt you to sin, <b>drag it to the study hall</b> and study Torah. <b>If it is</b> like <b>a stone, it will be dissolved</b> by the Torah. <b>If it is</b> like <b>iron, it will be shattered.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If it is</b> like <b>stone, it will be dissolved, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who is thirsty, come you for the water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), water in this context meaning Torah; <b>and it is written: “Stones were worn by water”</b> (Job 14:19). <b>If it is</b> like <b>iron, it will be shattered, as it is written: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord; and like a hammer that shatters rock”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). |
| Isaiah 55:1 | “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” | Taanit 7a:13 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “To him who is thirsty bring water”</b> (Isaiah 21:14), which indicates that the one who has water must bring it to the thirsty person, <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), from which it may be inferred that the thirsty person must seek out water himself. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa resolves this apparent contradiction by explaining that <b>if he is a worthy student</b> the teacher must seek him out, as in <b>“to him who is thirsty bring water,” but if</b> the student is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water,”</b> i.e., this student must seek out a teacher himself. |
| Isaiah 55:1 | And Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi said: Why are matters of Torah likened to water, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” | Taanit 7a:15 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi said: Why are matters of Torah likened to water, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1)? This verse comes <b>to tell you: Just as water leaves a high place and flows to a low place, so too, Torah matters are retained only by one whose spirit is lowly,</b> i.e., a humble person. |
| Isaiah 55:6 | But isn’t it written: “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him when He is near” | Rosh Hashanah18a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him when He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that there are times when He is not near and does not answer. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the verse is referring to <b>an individual,</b> to whom God is near only at certain times; <b>here</b> the verse is referring to <b>a community,</b> to which God is close whenever the people call out to Him. |
| Isaiah 55:6 | ” | Yevamot 105a:17 | <b>Rather,</b> one must say as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>even when</b> a community’s sentence <b>is sealed, it may be torn up</b> as a result of repentance, <b>as it is stated: “For what</b> great nation is there, that has God so close unto them, <b>as the Lord our God is whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7). The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it written</b> in another verse: <b>“Seek the Lord while He may be found,</b> call upon Him when He is near<b>”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), implying that God is not always near and may not always answer whenever we call upon Him? The Gemara answers: This contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> verse <b>is concerning an individual</b> who must seek God where He is found, as He is not always equally accessible to answer those who call out to Him. <b>That</b> first verse <b>is concerning a community,</b> for whom He is accessible “whenever we call upon Him.” |
| Isaiah 55:6 | you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near” | Yevamot 49b:7 | The Gemara expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said:</b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him.</b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said:</b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6). |
| Isaiah 55:7 | This cannot enter your mind, as it is written: “And let him return to the Lord, and He will have compassion upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon” | Megillah 17b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the sequence of blessings is based on this verse, <b>let</b> us <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> blessing of <b>healing should be said after</b> the blessing of <b>repentance.</b> Why, then, is the next blessing in the <i>Amida</i> the blessing of forgiveness and not the blessing of healing? The Gemara explains: <b>This cannot enter your mind, as it is written: “And let him return to the Lord, and He will have compassion upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon”</b> (Isaiah 55:7), which shows that the theme of repentance should be followed by that of forgiveness. |
| Isaiah 55:10 | Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said: Rain is the husband of the earth, as it is stated: “For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, except it waters the earth, and makes it give birth and sprout” | Taanit 6b:7 | § The Gemara returns to the subject of rain. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is</b> the meaning of the <b>term</b> for rainfall, <b><i>revia</i>?</b> It is referring to <b>a matter that penetrates [<i>rove’a</i>],</b> i.e., which causes <b>the earth</b> to bear fruit. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said: Rain is the husband of the earth, as it is stated: “For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, except it waters the earth, and makes it give birth and sprout”</b> (Isaiah 55:10). This verse indicates that rain fructifies the earth in the manner of a husband and wife. |
| Isaiah 55:10 | and causes it to give birth and bud” | Taanit 8b:2 | Likewise, an expression of <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>giving birth is</b> also <b>stated with regard to rain.</b> Specifically, <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, as it is written</b> in the case of Rachel, when God had mercy on her: <b>“And she conceived and gave birth to a son”</b> (Genesis 30:23). <b>And giving birth is stated with regard to rain, as it is written:</b> “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, except it waters the earth <b>and causes it to give birth and bud”</b> (Isaiah 55:10). |
| Isaiah 55:12 | Sason said to Simḥa: One day they will dismiss you and render you a messenger [ parvanka ], as it is written: “For you shall go out with happiness [ simḥa ]” | Sukkah 48b:5 | Apropos this verse, the Gemara relates: There were <b>these two heretics, one named Sason and one named Simḥa. Sason said to Simḥa: I am superior to you, as it is written: “They shall obtain joy [<i>sason</i>] and happiness [<i>simḥa</i>],</b> and sorrow and sighing shall flee” (Isaiah 35:10). The verse mentions joy first. <b>Simḥa said to Sason,</b> On the contrary, <b>I am superior to you, as it is written: “There was happiness [<i>simḥa</i>] and joy [<i>sason</i>] for the Jews”</b> (Esther 8:17). <b>Sason said to Simḥa: One day they will dismiss you and render you a messenger [<i>parvanka</i>], as it is written: “For you shall go out with happiness [<i>simḥa</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 55:12). <b>Simḥa said to Sason: One day they will dismiss you and draw water with you, as it is written: “With joy [<i>sason</i>] you shall draw water.”</b> |
| Isaiah 55:13 | Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Instead of the thorn shall the cypress come up, and instead of the nettle shall the myrtle come up; | Megillah 10b:19 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Instead of the thorn shall the cypress come up, and instead of the nettle shall the myrtle come up;</b> and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off” (Isaiah 55:13). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verse homiletically as referring to the righteous individuals who superseded the wicked ones in the book of Esther. |
| Isaiah 56:1 | Rabbi Yehuda says: Great is charity in that it advances the redemption, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, uphold justice and do charity, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed” | Bava Batra10a:12 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Great is charity in that it advances the redemption, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, uphold justice and do charity, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed”</b> (Isaiah 56:1). <b>He would say: Ten strong entities were created in the world,</b> one stronger than the other. <b>A mountain is strong,</b> but <b>iron,</b> which is stronger, <b>cleaves it. Iron is strong,</b> but <b>fire melts it. Fire is strong,</b> but <b>water extinguishes it. Water is strong,</b> but <b>clouds bear it. Clouds are strong,</b> but <b>wind disperses them. Wind is strong,</b> but the human <b>body withstands it.</b> The human <b>body is strong,</b> but <b>fear breaks it. Fear is strong,</b> but <b>wine dispels it. Wine is strong,</b> but <b>sleep drives it off. And death is stronger than them all, but charity saves</b> a person <b>from death, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2, 11:4). |
| Isaiah 56:1 | upon two, as it is stated: “So says the Lord: Observe justice and perform righteousness” | Makkot 24a:27 | <b>Isaiah then established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon two, as it is stated: “So says the Lord: Observe justice and perform righteousness”</b> (Isaiah 56:1). <b>Amos came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon one, as it is stated: “So says the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek Me and live”</b> (Amos 5:4). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this:</b> There is no proof that the verse in Amos is establishing all the mitzvot upon one; <b>say</b> that Amos is saying: <b>Seek Me throughout the entire Torah,</b> as the verse does not specify the manner in which one should seek the Lord. <b>Rather,</b> say: <b>Habakkuk came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon one, as it is stated: “But the righteous person shall live by his faith”</b> (Habakkuk 2:4). |
| Isaiah 56:2 | from desecrating it [ meḥallelo ], | Shabbat 118b:3 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who observes Shabbat in accordance with its <i>halakhot</i>, even</b> if he <b>worships idolatry as</b> in <b>the generation of Enosh,</b> God <b>forgives him</b> his sins, <b>as it is stated: “Fortunate is the man [enosh] who does this</b> and the person who holds strong to it, one who guards the Shabbat <b>from desecrating it [<i>meḥallelo</i>],</b> and guards his hand from doing any evil” (Isaiah 56:2). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>From desecrating it [<i>meḥallelo</i>], but rather: He is forgiven [<i>maḥul lo</i>].</b> With regard to the generation of Enosh it is written: “And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began [<i>huḥal</i>] to call upon the Name of God” (Genesis 4:26), meaning to desecrate [<i>leḥallel</i>] His name. |
| Isaiah 56:4 | Granted, according to the one who says that idol worship was emasculated during their lifetime, that is as it is written: “For so says the Lord to the sarisim who observe My Shabbatot , | Sanhedrin 93b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that idol worship was emasculated during their lifetime, that is as it is written: “For so says the Lord to the <i>sarisim</i> who observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and choose what pleases Me, and keep My covenant” (Isaiah 56:4). This verse calls them <i>sarisim</i> due to their miraculous deliverance from the furnace. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that they were <b>literally eunuchs,</b> would <b>the verse speak in denigration of the righteous?</b> Would the verse identify Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah by their blemish rather than by their names? The Gemara answers: According to the one who says that they were literally eunuchs, both <b>this,</b> the physical imperfection, <b>and that,</b> the fact that idol worship was emasculated during their lifetime, <b>were</b> true <b>concerning them.</b> |
| Isaiah 56:4 | it is stated: “So said God to the eunuchs who will keep My Shabbatot” | Shabbat 118b:4 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Had the Jewish people</b> properly <b>observed</b> the <b>first Shabbat</b> that was commanded them, <b>no nation or tongue would have</b> ever <b>ruled them, as it is stated: “And it happened on the seventh day, some people went out from the nation to collect</b> and they did not find” (Exodus 16:27). <b>And it is written after</b> they went out to collect manna: <b>“And Amalek came</b> and fought with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: If only the Jewish people would keep two <i>Shabbatot</i> in accordance with their <i>halakhot</i>,</b> they would be <b>immediately redeemed,</b> as <b>it is stated: “So said God to the eunuchs who will keep My Shabbatot”</b> (Isaiah 56:4), <b>and it is written after</b> that: <b>“And I will bring them to My holy mountain</b> and will let them rejoice in My house of prayer” (Isaiah 56:7). |
| Isaiah 56:5 | in My house and within My walls a memorial better than sons and daughters: | Sanhedrin 93b:15 | The Gemara asks from another perspective: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that they were <b>literally eunuchs, that is as it is written</b> in the next verse: “And to them I will give <b>in My house and within My walls a memorial better than sons and daughters:</b> I will give him an everlasting name, that shall not be excised” (Isaiah 56:5). <b>But according to the one who says that idol worship was emasculated during their lifetime, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“better than sons and daughters”? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> It is consolation <b>concerning children that they already had and</b> who <b>died,</b> that they would also be memorialized. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“an everlasting name that shall not be excised”? Rabbi Tanḥum says</b> that <b>bar Kappara taught in Tzippori: This</b> is referring to <b>the book of Daniel, which is called by his name.</b> |
| Isaiah 56:7 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays? As it is stated: “I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in the house of My prayer” | Berakhot 7a:1 | Along the same lines, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays? As it is stated: “I will bring them to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in the house of My prayer”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). The verse <b>does not say</b> the house of <b>their prayer, but rather, “</b>the house of <b>My prayer”; from here</b> we see <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, prays.</b> |
| Isaiah 56:7 | prayer will come, as it is stated: “I will bring them to My sacred mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer” | Megillah 18a:1 | <b>“Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek the Lord their God and David their king”</b> (Hosea 3:5), and consequently, the blessing of the kingdom of David follows the blessing of the building of Jerusalem. <b>And once</b> the scion of <b>David comes,</b> the time for <b>prayer will come, as it is stated: “I will bring them to My sacred mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). Therefore, the blessing of hearing prayer is recited after the blessing of the kingdom of David. |
| Isaiah 56:7 | “Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar” | Megillah 18a:2 | <b>And after prayer comes, the</b> Temple <b>service will arrive, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). The blessing of restoration of the Temple service follows the blessing of hearing prayer. <b>And when the</b> Temple <b>service comes,</b> with it will also <b>come thanksgiving, as it is stated: “Whoever sacrifices a thanks-offering honors Me”</b> (Psalms 50:23), which teaches that thanksgiving follows sacrifice. Therefore, the blessing of thanksgiving follows the blessing of restoration of the Temple service. |
| Isaiah 56:7 | “And I will bring them to My holy mountain | Shabbat 118b:4 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Had the Jewish people</b> properly <b>observed</b> the <b>first Shabbat</b> that was commanded them, <b>no nation or tongue would have</b> ever <b>ruled them, as it is stated: “And it happened on the seventh day, some people went out from the nation to collect</b> and they did not find” (Exodus 16:27). <b>And it is written after</b> they went out to collect manna: <b>“And Amalek came</b> and fought with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: If only the Jewish people would keep two <i>Shabbatot</i> in accordance with their <i>halakhot</i>,</b> they would be <b>immediately redeemed,</b> as <b>it is stated: “So said God to the eunuchs who will keep My Shabbatot”</b> (Isaiah 56:4), <b>and it is written after</b> that: <b>“And I will bring them to My holy mountain</b> and will let them rejoice in My house of prayer” (Isaiah 56:7). |
| Isaiah 56:11 | “Yea, the dogs are greedy” | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Isaiah 56:12 | “Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, | Taanit 11a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> comments: Up <b>to this point</b> is the <b>attribute of middling people,</b> who merely exclude themselves from the suffering of the community. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>attribute of wicked people, what is written</b> about those who hope for more of these days? <b>“Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,</b> and much more abundant” (Isaiah 56:12). <b>And what is written afterward? “The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart,</b> and godly men are taken away, none considering <b>that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come”</b> (Isaiah 57:1). This verse teaches that righteous people suffer early death to prevent them from witnessing the harm that will befall these evil people. |
| Isaiah 57:1 | as it is written: “The righteous is taken away because of the evil to come” | Bava Kamma60a:18 | <b>Rav Yosef cried</b> and said: <b>Are all these</b> righteous people <b>also compared to nothing</b> when calamity strikes? <b>Abaye said to him: It is goodness for</b> the righteous that they die first, <b>as it is written: “The righteous is taken away because of the evil to come”</b> (Isaiah 57:1), so that he will not have to endure the suffering that will befall the people. |
| Isaiah 57:1 | passes from the world, evil comes into the world, as it is stated: “The righteous perishes and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken, none understand that due to the evil the righteous is taken” | Sanhedrin 113b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach”</b> (Proverbs 18:3).

| Isaiah 57:2 | it states: “He enters into peace, they rest on their beds | Shabbat 152b:6 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, also</b> acts in this way. <b>With regard to the bodies of the righteous,</b> which are likened to the royal garments that are well kept, <b>it states: “He enters into peace, they rest on their beds</b> each one that walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2). <b>And with regard to their souls, it states: “And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life</b> with the Lord your God” (I Samuel 25:29). And conversely, <b>with regard to the bodies of the wicked, it states: “There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 57:21), <b>and with regard to their souls, it states: “And the souls of your enemies He shall sling out in the hollow of a sling”</b> (I Samuel 25:29). |
| Isaiah 57:8 | the verse says: “And behind the door and the doorpost you place your memory” | Shabbat 116a:8 | Apropos the scrolls of heretics, the Gemara analyzes <b>the matter itself.</b> With regard to <b>the blank folios and the</b> Torah <b>scrolls of</b> the <b>heretics, one does not rescue them from the fire. Rabbi Yosei says: During the week, one cuts the names</b> of God contained <b>therein and buries them, and burns the rest. Rabbi Tarfon said</b> in the form of an oath: <b>I will bury my sons</b> if I fail to do the following, <b>that if</b> these books <b>come into my possession I will burn them and the names</b> contained <b>therein. As even</b> if <b>a person is pursuing him</b> with the intent <b>to kill him, and a snake is hurrying to bite him, one enters a house of idolatry and does not enter the houses of these</b> heretics. The reason is <b>that these</b> heretics <b>are aware</b> of the greatness of the Creator manifest in the Torah and its mitzvot, <b>and</b> nevertheless, they <b>deny</b> the existence of God; <b>whereas these</b> idolators <b>are not aware, and</b> that is the reason that they <b>deny</b> the existence of God. <b>And with regard to the</b> heretics, <b>the verse says: “And behind the door and the doorpost you place your memory”</b> (Isaiah 57:8). Although they remember the word of God, they treat it contemptuously, as if casting it behind the door. |
| Isaiah 57:13 | as it is stated: “When you cry, let those you have gathered deliver you” | Bava Batra91b:3 | The Gemara returns to its discussion of the punishment of Elimelech and his sons, which Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says they received because they left Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Heaven forfend</b> that they sinned in this manner, <b>as</b> if Elimelech and his sons <b>had found even bran they would not have left</b> Eretz Yisrael. <b>But rather, for what</b> reason were <b>they punished?</b> They were punished <b>because they should have requested mercy</b> of God <b>for their generation, and they did not request</b> this, <b>as it is stated: “When you cry, let those you have gathered deliver you”</b> (Isaiah 57:13). |
| Isaiah 57:14 | “And He will say: Pave, pave, clear the way, | Moed Katan5a:19 | <b>Abaye said:</b> An allusion to the marking of graves may be learned <b>from here,</b> as it is written: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). <b>Rav Pappa said</b> the obligation is alluded to in the verse: <b>“And He will say: Pave, pave, clear the way,</b> take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people” (Isaiah 57:14), which indicates that roads must be cleared of all obstacles and hazards. |
| Isaiah 57:14 | “Take up the stumbling block from the way of My people” | Moed Katan5a:20 | <b>Rav Ḥinnana said:</b> This may be derived from the end of that very same verse: <b>“Take up the stumbling block from the way of My people”</b> (Isaiah 57:14). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> This may be derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall show them the way in which they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20), i.e., you must properly repair the roads, which includes marking graves. |
| Isaiah 57:14 | Isaiah called it a stumbling block, as it is stated: “And He will say: Cast you up, cast you up, clear the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people” | Sukkah 52a:9 | <b>Isaiah called it a stumbling block, as it is stated: “And He will say: Cast you up, cast you up, clear the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of My people”</b> (Isaiah 57:14). <b>Ezekiel called it stone, as it is stated: “And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh”</b> (Ezekiel 36:26). <b>Joel called it hidden one, as it says: “But I will remove the northern one [<i>hatzefoni</i>] far off from you”</b> (Joel 2:20). <b>The Sages taught</b> concerning the verse: <b>“But I will remove the northern one [<i>hatzefoni</i>] far off from you,”</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to <b>the evil inclination.</b> And why is the evil inclination referred to as <i>tzefoni</i>? It is due to the fact <b>that it is always hidden [<i>tzafun</i>] in the heart of man.</b> |
| Isaiah 57:15 | thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred” | Megillah 31a:13 | <b>It is written in the Torah: “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets:</b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward:</b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a third time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is the Lord”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6). |
| Isaiah 57:15 | also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, | Sotah 5a:7 | The Gemara continues the discussion of arrogance, and its converse, humility. The verse states: “For thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, <b>also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> offered differing interpretations of this verse. <b>One says</b> that the verse means: Together <b>with Me</b> is the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble. In other words, God elevates the humble. <b>And one says</b> that the verse means: <b>I,</b> God, descend, and am found together <b>with</b> the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble. |
| Isaiah 57:16 | As it is stated: “For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made” | Avodah Zarah5a:10 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. <b>As it is stated: “For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). According to Rabbi Yosei, in order for the Messiah to come in the end of days, it is necessary for the future generations to be born. |
| Isaiah 57:16 | as it is written: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made” | Chagigah 12b:13 | <b>The souls of the righteous</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And the soul of my master shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord, your God”</b> (I Samuel 25:29). <b>Spirits and souls that are to be created</b> are found there, <b>as it is written: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16), which indicates that the spirit to be released into the world, wrapped around a body, is located close to God. <b>The dew that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will use to revive the dead</b> is found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “A bountiful rain You will pour down, God; when Your inheritance was weary, You confirmed it”</b> (Psalms 68:10). |
| Isaiah 57:16 | will never cease. Netzaḥ , as it is written: “For I will not contend forever; neither will I be eternally [ lanetzaḥ ] angry” | Eruvin 54a:14 | With regard to the end of this verse, a Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wherever it states <i>netzaḥ</i></b>, <b>Selah,</b> or <b><i>va’ed</i></b>, the matter <b>will never cease. <i>Netzaḥ</i>, as it is written: “For I will not contend forever; neither will I be eternally [<i>lanetzaḥ</i>] angry”</b> (Isaiah 57:16), which demonstrates that <i>netzaḥ</i> bears a similar meaning to forever. |
| Isaiah 57:16 | As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made” | Niddah 13b:7 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that they marry minor girls who are not</b> yet <b>capable of bearing children,</b> consequently emitting semen for naught. <b>As Rabbi Yosei said: The</b> Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies do so. <b>As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). The verse is interpreted as follows: The spirit, i.e., the souls about which it has been decreed by Me that they are to be born, if they are not born, they enwrap the Messiah and prevent him from coming. |
| Isaiah 57:16 | as it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, | Yevamot 62a:17 | The Gemara clarifies the reasons for their opinions: <b>Rav Huna said</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva <b>due to</b> a statement <b>of Rav Asi, as Rav Asi said</b> that the reason for this mitzva is that the Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so, <b>as it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me,</b> and the souls that I have made” (Isaiah 57:16). Consequently, once a child has been born and his soul has entered a body the mitzva has been fulfilled, even if the child subsequently dies. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> he has <b>not fulfilled</b> the mitzva, as <b>we require “He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18), <b>and</b> this <b>is not</b> fulfilled when the children have passed away and no longer inhabit the earth. |
| Isaiah 57:16 | As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made” | Yevamot 63b:16 | <b>Rabbi Asi said: The</b> Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. <b>As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who does not engage in</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply</b> is considered <b>as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And you, be fruitful and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7). |
| Isaiah 57:19 | blew [ nibba ] is not mistaken, as it is written: “He creates the fruit [ niv ] of the lips” | Bava Kamma60a:3 | Rav Naḥman explained: The <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>fanned [<i>libba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “With a flame [<i>belabbat</i>] of fire”</b> (Exodus 3:2), <b>and</b> the <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>blew [<i>nibba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “He creates the fruit [<i>niv</i>] of the lips”</b> (Isaiah 57:19), which can be interpreted as referring to the breath of the lips. |
| Isaiah 57:19 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As the verse stated: “The Lord that creates the expression of the lips says, Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near; and I will heal him” | Berakhot 34b:17 | We learned in the mishna: <b>They said about Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Dosa that the indication whether or not his prayer was accepted was whether the prayer was fluent in his mouth as he recited it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that this is an accurate indication of whether or not his prayer was accepted, derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As the verse stated: “The Lord that creates the expression of the lips says, Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19). It can be inferred from this verse that if speech of the lips, fluent speech, is granted to one who prays, it indicates that his prayer on behalf of the ill has been accepted and I will heal him, that person will be healed. |
| Isaiah 57:19 | “Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him” | Berakhot 55b:10 | <b>And three</b> mentions of <b>peace, as it is written:</b><br><b>“Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, says the Lord that creates the expression of the lips; and I will heal him”</b> (Isaiah 57:19); <br><b>“Then the spirit clothed Amasai,</b> who was chief of the captains: Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son of Yishai;<br><b>peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers”</b> (I Chronicles 12:19);<br>and: <b>“Thus you shall say: All hail and peace be both unto you,</b><br><b>and peace be to your house,</b> and peace be unto all that you have” (I Samuel 25:6). |
| Isaiah 57:19 | the completely righteous do not stand, as it is stated: “Peace, peace upon him who is far and him who is near” | Sanhedrin 99a:13 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All of the prophets prophesied</b> their prophecies of consolation <b>only with regard to penitents, but with regard to</b> the reward of <b>the completely righteous</b> it is stated: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the opinion expressed in <b>this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who holds that penitents are superior to the righteous, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rav says: In the place where penitents stand,</b> even <b>the completely righteous do not stand, as it is stated: “Peace, peace upon him who is far and him who is near”</b> (Isaiah 57:19). Peace and greeting is extended <b>first</b> to <b>him who is far, and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> is peace extended to <b>him who is near. What</b> is the meaning of the term: “Upon him who is <b>far”?</b> It means: One who was <b>initially far,</b> i.e., the penitent. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term: “Him who is <b>near”?</b> It means: One who was <b>initially near and</b> continues to be near <b>at present,</b> i.e., the completely righteous individual. |
| Isaiah 57:20 | any person who has arrogance within him, even a slight wind disturbs him, as it is stated: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, | Sotah 5a:15 | <b>Rabbi Alexandri says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, even a slight wind disturbs him, as it is stated: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea,</b> for it cannot rest” (Isaiah 57:20). <b>And if</b> with regard to the <b>sea,</b> which <b>contains many</b> quantities of <b>quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> of water, yet <b>a slight wind disturbs it,</b> certainly with regard to <b>a person, who has</b> in his body <b>only one quarter-<i>log</i></b> of essential lifeblood, <b>all the more so</b> will a slight wind disturb him. |
| Isaiah 57:21 | with regard to the bodies of the wicked, it states: “There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked” | Shabbat 152b:6 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, also</b> acts in this way. <b>With regard to the bodies of the righteous,</b> which are likened to the royal garments that are well kept, <b>it states: “He enters into peace, they rest on their beds</b> each one that walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2). <b>And with regard to their souls, it states: “And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life</b> with the Lord your God” (I Samuel 25:29). And conversely, <b>with regard to the bodies of the wicked, it states: “There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 57:21), <b>and with regard to their souls, it states: “And the souls of your enemies He shall sling out in the hollow of a sling”</b> (I Samuel 25:29). |
| Isaiah 58:1 | declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins” | Bava Metzia33b:2 | The Gemara asks: On the basis of <b>what homiletic interpretation</b> did the <i>tanna</i> state that there is no virtue greater than the study of Talmud? It <b>is</b> just <b>as Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, interpreted homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a horn, and <b>declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins”</b> (Isaiah 58:1)? |
| Isaiah 58:2 | to the study hall and taught: “Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways” | Chagigah 5b:22 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan left</b> Rav Idi and went <b>to the study hall and taught: “Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways”</b> (Isaiah 58:2). <b>But is</b> it possible that only <b>during the day they seek Him and at night they do not seek Him?</b> What is the meaning of daily? <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to say to you</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>even one day a year, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he engaged</b> in Torah study <b>the entire year.</b> |
| Isaiah 58:5 | as the verse states: “Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush [ ke’agmon ]” | Kiddushin 62b:7 | <b>Rabba says: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> this ruling <b>only with regard to fodder,</b> produce that has grown stalks even if it is not yet ripe. <b>But</b> he did <b>not</b> refer <b>to</b> produce that is still completely <b>soft [<i>agam</i>]. Rav Yosef says:</b> He <b>even</b> referred <b>to soft</b> produce. In relation to this dispute, the Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>agam</i> is a term of growth [<i>butzlana</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that this is <b>as the verse states: “Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush [<i>ke’agmon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 58:5), i.e., like a soft, drooping plant. |
| Isaiah 58:5 | gimon is a term of bending? As it is written: “Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush [ agmon ]” | Shabbat 54b:15 | We learned in the mishna: <b>And a calf may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a <i>gimon</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>A calf with a <i>gimon</i>? Rav Huna said</b>: <b>A small yoke</b> is placed on the calf in order to train it from an early age to bear a yoke. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it <b>inferred that this</b> term <b><i>gimon</i> is a term of bending? As it is written: “Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush [<i>agmon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 58:5). There is an etymological similarity between the words <i>gimon</i> and <i>agmon</i>. |
| Isaiah 58:7 | you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house?” | Bava Batra10a:5 | Turnus Rufus <b>said to him: You are called sons and you are called slaves. When you fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called sons; when you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called slaves. And</b> since <b>now you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent,</b> the parable that I offered is more apt. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> The verse <b>states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and</b> that <b>you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). <b>When</b> do we <b>bring the poor that are cast out</b> into our <b>houses? Now,</b> when we have to billet the Roman soldiers in our homes; <b>and</b> about that very time, the verse <b>states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</b> |
| Isaiah 58:7 | “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?” | Bava Batra9a:13 | The Gemara offers <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following statements extolling the mitzva of charity: <b>Greater; Temple; Moses. Rabbi Elazar says: One who causes others to perform [<i>me’aseh</i>]</b> a meritorious act <b>is greater than one who performs</b> that act himself, <b>as it is stated: “And the causing [<i>ma’aseh</i>] of righteousness shall be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever”</b> (Isaiah 32:17). If one <b>merits,</b> the following verse is applied to him: <b>“Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), i.e., he will wholeheartedly give charity to the poor. If he <b>does not merit,</b> the latter clause of that verse is applied to him: <b>“You shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house,”</b> i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and sustain them against his will. |
| Isaiah 58:7 | “Is it not to share [ paros ] your bread with the hungry?” | Bava Batra9a:7 | <b>If you wish, say</b> that this distinction is derived via <b>logical reasoning: This one</b> who stands before us in rags <b>is exposed to contempt, whereas that one</b> who is hungry <b>is not exposed to contempt. If you wish, say</b> instead that this distinction is derived from <b>a verse,</b> as it is written: <b>“Is it not to share [<i>paros</i>] your bread with the hungry?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). The word <i>paros</i> <b>is written with a <i>shin</i>,</b> alluding to the word <i>parosh</i>, meaning <b>examine</b> and investigate, <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> should you <b>give him. And there</b> in the same verse <b>it is written</b> with regard to clothing: <b>“When you see the naked, that you cover him,”</b> indicating that <b>“when you see”</b> him you should <b>immediately</b> cover him. |
| Isaiah 58:7 | and that you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, | Bava Batra9b:8 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Anyone who gives a <i>peruta</i> to a poor person receives six blessings, and whoever consoles him with words</b> of comfort and encouragement <b>receives eleven blessings.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>One who gives a <i>peruta</i> to a poor person receives six blessings, as it is written: “Is it not to share</b> your bread with the hungry, <b>and that you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house? When you see the naked,</b> that you cover him” (Isaiah 58:7). And the next verses list six blessings: “Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily, and your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard. Then, shall you call, and the Lord shall answer; you shall cry, and He shall say: Here I am” (Isaiah 58:8–9). |
| Isaiah 58:7 | “and that you do not hide yourself from your own flesh” | Ketubot 52b:6 | Later <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in regret: <b>We have made ourselves like legal advisors,</b> who help people with their legal claims. The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset, what did he hold and ultimately, what did he hold?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>At the outset he held</b> that one should act in accordance with the verse <b>“and that you do not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), which indicates that one must help his relatives. <b>And ultimately he held</b> that <b>an important person is different.</b> If a man of stature offers assistance to his family in a manner that causes a loss to another individual, it appears as though he were unfairly favoring his relatives. |
| Isaiah 58:7 | “And you should not hide yourself from your own flesh” | Ketubot 86a:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman</b> later <b>said</b> in regret: <b>We have made ourselves like advisors of judges.</b> We have acted like lawyers who give practical advice to litigants rather than like independent judges. The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset, what did he hold</b> when he intended the daughter to hear his advice, <b>and ultimately, what did he hold</b> that made him regret his action? The Gemara explains: <b>At the outset, he held</b> that the verse teaches: <b>“And you should not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), and therefore it is correct to give help and advice to relatives. <b>And ultimately he held that</b> in the case of <b>an important person</b> who must be very careful to avoid any impression of having favored his family in judgment, the situation <b>is different.</b> |
| Isaiah 58:7 | and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh” | Shevuot 39a:2 | <b>And</b> be aware that <b>with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7); <b>whereas here,</b> with regard to taking a false oath, <b>it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>].” And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The verse indicates that one who sins with his mouth, by taking a false oath, causes his flesh to be punished as well; <b>and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). |

| Isaiah 58:8 | with regard to all the righteous individuals, as it is stated: “Your righteousness shall go before you and the glory of the Lord shall gather you in” | Sotah 9b:10 | <b>Moses merited</b> to be the only person involved <b>in</b> the transportation of <b>Joseph’s bones</b> to be buried in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and there was none among the Jewish people greater than he, as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19). <b>Who</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses, as no one involved himself in his</b> burial <b>other than the Omnipresent</b> Himself, <b>as it is stated: “And He buried him in the valley</b> in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; and no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6).

| Isaiah 58:9 | and who lends a sela to a pauper at his time of need, about him the verse states: “Then shall you call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and He will say: Here I am” | Yevamot 63a:1 | <b>and who lends a <i>sela</i> to a pauper at his time of need, about him the verse states: “Then shall you call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and He will say: Here I am”</b> (Isaiah 58:9). |
| Isaiah 58:11 | and make your bones strong [ yaḥalitz ]” | Yevamot 102b:12 | The Gemara challenges further: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is written:</b> “And the Lord will guide you, and satisfy your soul in drought, <b>and make your bones strong [<i>yaḥalitz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 58:11), <b>and Rabbi Elazar said</b> regarding that verse: <b>This is the greatest of blessings, and Rava said</b> it means: <b>Strengthening of bones.</b> This seems to indicate that the root of the word <i>ḥalitza</i> is referring to strengthening. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it has this connotation, and it has this connotation,</b> i.e., the root <i>ḥ-l-tz</i> sometimes connotes removal and sometimes connotes strengthening. <b>But here,</b> only one meaning is possible, as, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <i>ḥalitza</i> here <b>connotes strengthening, then let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: <b>She shall strengthen [<i>ḥaletza</i>] his shoe on his foot [<i>beraglo</i>],</b> indicating that she should tighten the shoe on his foot, rather than stating: “From on his foot [<i>me’al raglo</i>],” which indicates that she is removing something from his foot. |
| Isaiah 58:13 | as it is written: “And you shall call Shabbat a delight” | Bava Metzia54a:14 | <b>Rather, if</b> it <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated like this: Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All concede</b> that <b>concerning Shabbat with regard to consecrated</b> property <b>that he</b> successfully <b>desacralized</b> the property. <b>One</b> reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as it is written: “And you shall call Shabbat a delight”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). The Sages sought to facilitate that delight in Shabbat by ruling leniently. <b>And furthermore,</b> it is desacralized without payment of the additional one-fifth, <b>since</b> the Temple <b>treasurers demand</b> payment from <b>him in the marketplace.</b> |
| Isaiah 58:13 | since it is written: “And call Shabbat a delight” | Beitzah 34b:3 | Based on these two sources, <b>Rava inquired of Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>Shabbat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of <b>whether it establish</b>es an obligation <b>to tithe</b> food that has been <b><i>muktze</i></b> on Shabbat? Specifically, in the case of <b>an item whose labor has not been completed,</b> does the fact that the food is <i>muktze</i> on Shabbat give it the status of completely prepared food, or not? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And call Shabbat a delight”</b> (Isaiah 58:13), this implies that any food one eats on Shabbat is considered a delight and not a casual meal, and therefore Shabbat <b>establishes</b> an obligation to tithe, as if the food were fully completed and fit to be eaten as a fixed meal, <b>even for an item that has not</b> had its <b>labor completed? Or perhaps</b> Shabbat <b>establishes</b> an obligation to tithe <b>an item whose labor is completed,</b> but regarding <b>an item whose labor is not completed it does not establish</b> an obligation to tithe? |
| Isaiah 58:13 | “If you proclaim Shabbat a delight, | Chullin 111a:7 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna visited the house of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman</b> and dined with him on Shabbat. <b>They brought before him three <i>se’a</i></b> of fine bread that had been <b>kneaded</b> in oil and honey. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to</b> the members of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman’s household: <b>Did you know that I was coming,</b> that you prepared such superior food? <b>They said to him: Are you more distinguished than</b> Shabbat, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“If you proclaim Shabbat a delight,</b> the sacred day of God honored” (Isaiah 58:13). |
| Isaiah 58:13 | limit, he may not reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet [ raglekha ] due to Shabbat” | Eruvin 52b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> If <b>one of his feet was within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, and his other foot was beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, he may not reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet [<i>raglekha</i>] due to Shabbat”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). The word <i>raglekha</i> <b>is written</b> in defective form without the letter <i>yod</i>, and can therefore be read as <b>your foot</b> in the singular, indicating that Shabbat can be desecrated by the reentry of even a single foot. |
| Isaiah 58:13 | limit, he may reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet due to Shabbat” | Eruvin 52b:9 | The Gemara cites a different version of the previous discussion. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> If <b>one of his feet was within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, and his other foot was beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit, he may reenter, as it is written: “If you turn away your feet due to Shabbat”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). <b>We read</b> the word <i>raglekha</i> as <b>your feet,</b> in the plural, indicating that the entry of a single foot is permitted. |
| Isaiah 58:13 | “If you proclaim Shabbat a delight, | Pesachim 68b:10 | <b><i>Ayin</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>mem</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> consisting of the first letter of <i>Atzeret</i>, the middle letter of Shabbat and the final letter of Purim. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: All agree with regard to <i>Atzeret</i>,</b> the holiday of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>that we require</b> that it be <b>also “for you,”</b> meaning that it is a mitzva to eat, drink, and rejoice on that day. <b>What is the reason? It is the day on which the Torah was given,</b> and one must celebrate the fact that the Torah was given to the Jewish people. <b>Rabba said: All agree with regard to Shabbat that we require</b> that it be <b>also “for you.” What is the reason?</b> Because the verse states: <b>“If you proclaim Shabbat a delight,</b> the sacred day of God honored” (Isaiah 58:13). <b>Rav Yosef said: All agree with regard to Purim that we require</b> that it be <b>also “for you.” What is the reason?</b> Because <b>it is written:</b> “To observe them as <b>days of feasting and gladness”</b> (Esther 9:22). |
| Isaiah 58:13 | and you honor it by not going your own way, | Shabbat 113a:14 | On a related note, the Gemara cites what we learned with regard to the following passage: “If you keep your feet from breaking, from pursuing your affairs on My holy day, and you call Shabbat a delight, the Lord’s holy day honorable, <b>and you honor it by not going your own way,</b> from attending to your affairs and speaking idle words” (Isaiah 58:13). The Rabbis derived from the words <b>“and you honor it” that your dress on Shabbat should not be like your dress during the week, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would <b>refer to his clothing as my honor,</b> indicating that appropriate clothing is a form of deference. The words <b>“going your own way”</b> mean <b>that your walking on Shabbat should not be like your walking during the week. “From attending to your affairs”</b> means it <b>is prohibited</b> to deal with <b>your</b> weekday <b>affairs</b> and to speak about them on Shabbat. However, <b>affairs of Heaven,</b> i.e., those pertaining to mitzvot, <b>are permitted. “And speaking idle words”</b> |
| Isaiah 58:13 | which is written, “The holy one of God is honored” | Shabbat 119a:9 | <b>The Exilarch said to Rav Hamnuna: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written, “The holy one of God is honored”</b> (Isaiah 58:13)? Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: That is Yom Kippur, when there is no eating or drinking,</b> and so the <b>Torah said: Honor it with a clean garment.</b> And with regard to that which is stated about Shabbat, <b>“And you shall honor it,” Rav said: To</b> honor Shabbat, <b>make</b> the Shabbat feast <b>earlier</b> than on other days, in order to show that one delights in eating it. <b>And Shmuel said: To</b> honor Shabbat, <b>make</b> the Shabbat feast <b>later,</b> so that one’s appetite will be greater. <b>The sons of Rav Pappa bar Abba said to Rav Pappa:</b> People <b>like us, for whom meat and wine is found</b> on our table <b>every day, in what</b> manner <b>can we change it</b> on Shabbat? He <b>said to them: If you are accustomed to</b> eating your meal <b>early, make it later</b> on Shabbat; <b>if you are accustomed to making it late, make it earlier</b> on Shabbat. This difference will underscore the uniqueness of Shabbat. The Gemara relates: <b>In the summer, Rav Sheshet would seat the Sages</b> who attended his lecture in a place <b>where the sun would reach; in the winter, he would seat the Sages</b> in a place <b>where the shade would reach.</b> He did this <b>so</b> that <b>they would stand quickly</b> after the lecture ended and not engage in discussion, which would detract from the time devoted to delighting in Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> |
| Isaiah 58:13 | the verse said: “Nor pursuing your business, nor speaking of it” | Shabbat 150a:12 | <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may go to theaters [<i>tarteiot</i>], and circus performances [<i>kirkesaot</i>], and courthouses [<i>basilkaot</i>] to attend to communal affairs on Shabbat.

The Gemara answers that although speaking about similar things is generally prohibited on Shabbat, it is permitted in these cases because <b>the verse said: “Nor pursuing your business, nor speaking of it”</b> (Isaiah 58:13), which indicates that <b>your business</b> matters <b>are prohibited</b> to speak of on Shabbat, but <b>the business of Heaven,</b> matters which have religious significance, <b>is permitted</b> to speak of. |
| Isaiah 58:13 | nor pursuing your business, nor speaking of it” | Shabbat 150a:6 | <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa. And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa’s</b> ruling? <b>As it is written</b> in the verse from which we derive the prohibition to speak on Shabbat about activities that one may not perform on that day: “And you shall honor it by not doing your ways, <b>nor pursuing your business, nor speaking of it”</b> (Isaiah 58:13). We derive from this verse that <b>speaking is prohibited,</b> but merely <b>contemplating</b> these matters <b>is permitted.</b> |
| Isaiah 58:14 | “And I will cause you to ride on the heights [ bamotei ] of the world” | Shabbat 118b:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One who delights in Shabbat <b>is rescued from the oppression of exile.</b> He derives it by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“And I will cause you to ride on the heights [<i>bamotei</i>] of the world”</b> (Isaiah 58:14), <b>and it is written there:</b> “You are fortunate Israel, who is like you? A nation redeemed by God, the shield that aids you and the sword of your triumph. Your enemies will try to defeat you <b>and you will trample their high places [<i>bamoteimo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who delights in the Shabbat,</b> God <b>grants him his heart’s desires,</b> as <b>it is stated: “And you shall delight in God and He will grant you your heart’s desires”</b> (Psalms 37:4). <b>This delight</b> in God, which is mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When it says: “And you shall call the Shabbat delight,”</b> one <b>must say: It is the delight of Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With what does one delight</b> in the day of Shabbat? <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: With a dish of beets, and large fish, and heads of garlic.

| Isaiah 59:2 | as it is stated: “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, | Sanhedrin 65b:15 | <b>And when Rabbi Akiva would arrive at this verse he would weep</b> and say: <b>If one who starves himself so that a spirit of impurity will settle upon him</b> succeeds in doing so, and <b>a spirit of impurity settles upon him, all the more so one who starves himself so that a spirit of purity will settle upon him</b> should be successful, and a spirit of purity should settle upon him. <b>But what can I do, as our iniquities have caused us</b> not to merit the spirit of sanctity and purity, <b>as it is stated: “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,</b> and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will not hear” (Isaiah 59:2). |
| Isaiah 59:3 | that which is written: “For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue utters wickedness” | Shabbat 139a:10 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Mallai said in the name of Reish Lakish: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue utters wickedness”</b> (Isaiah 59:3)? |

| Isaiah 59:16 | in a generation that is entirely guilty, as it is written: “And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor; | Sanhedrin 98a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The son of David will come only in a generation that is entirely innocent,</b> in which case they will be deserving of redemption, <b>or</b> in a generation that is <b>entirely guilty,</b> in which case there will be no alternative to redemption.

| Isaiah 59:17 | which is written: “And He donned charity like a coat of mail” | Bava Batra9b:1 | <b>who perverted the ways of his mother.</b> He said <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And He donned charity like a coat of mail”</b> (Isaiah 59:17)? This verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>this coat of mail, each and every scale</b> of which it is fashioned <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large coat of mail, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i></b> that one gives <b>combines to</b> form <b>a great sum. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The same idea is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And all our charity is as a polluted garment”</b> (Isaiah 64:5). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this garment, each and every thread</b> in it <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large garment, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i> combines to</b> form <b>a great sum.</b> |
| Isaiah 59:17 | righteousness, as it is written: “And He donned righteousness as armor” | Chagigah 12b:12 | <b><i>Aravot</i>,</b> skies, is the firmament <b>that contains righteousness; justice; righteousness,</b> i.e., charity; <b>the treasuries of life; the treasuries of peace; the treasuries of blessing; the souls of the righteous; the spirits and souls that are to be created; and the dew that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will use to revive the dead.</b> The Gemara proves this statement: <b>Righteousness and justice</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>righteousness, as it is written: “And He donned righteousness as armor”</b> (Isaiah 59:17); <b>the treasuries of life, as it is written: “For with You is the source of life”</b> (Psalms 36:10). <b>And the treasuries of peace</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And he called Him the Lord of peace”</b> (Judges 6:24), implying that peace is God’s name and is therefore found close to Him. <b>And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from the Lord”</b> (Psalms 24:5). |
| Isaiah 59:19 | “For distress will come in like a river” | Berakhot 56b:9 | Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3). |
| Isaiah 59:19 | as it is stated: “When distress will come like a river that the breath of the Lord drives” | Sanhedrin 98a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation whose</b> wisdom and Torah study <b>is steadily diminishing, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “And the afflicted people You will redeem”</b> (II Samuel 22:28). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation</b> whose <b>troubles inundate it like a river, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “When distress will come like a river that the breath of the Lord drives”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“And a redeemer will come to Zion”</b> (Isaiah 59:20). |
| Isaiah 59:20 | “And a redeemer will come to Zion” | Sanhedrin 98a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation whose</b> wisdom and Torah study <b>is steadily diminishing, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “And the afflicted people You will redeem”</b> (II Samuel 22:28). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation</b> whose <b>troubles inundate it like a river, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “When distress will come like a river that the breath of the Lord drives”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“And a redeemer will come to Zion”</b> (Isaiah 59:20). |
| Isaiah 59:20 | Rabbi Yonatan said: Great is repentance, which hastens the redemption, as it is stated: “And a redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who repent from transgression in Jacob” | Yoma 86b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Great is repentance, which hastens the redemption, as it is stated: “And a redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who repent from transgression in Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 59:20). <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a redeemer will come to Zion?</b> It is <b>because</b> there are <b>those who repent from transgression in Jacob.</b> |
| Isaiah 59:21 | shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed’s seed, says the Lord, from now and forever” | Bava Metzia85a:18 | The Gemara relates other statements pertaining to Torah scholars and their descendants. <b>Rabbi Parnakh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who is a Torah scholar, and whose son</b> is <b>a Torah scholar, and whose grandson</b> is <b>a Torah scholar, the Torah will never again cease from his descendants, as it is stated: “And as for Me, this is My covenant…</b>My spirit that is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, <b>shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed’s seed, says the Lord, from now and forever”</b> (Isaiah 59:21). |
| Isaiah 60:2 | is written: “For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and fog the peoples; but the Lord shall shine upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you” | Sanhedrin 99a:1 | <b>And that is</b> the background for the following exchange, <b>as a certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu: When will</b> the <b>Messiah come?</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him:</b> He will come <b>when the darkness will enshroud these people,</b> i.e., you. The heretic <b>said to him:</b> Are <b>you cursing me</b> for no reason? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him,</b> I am merely relating to you <b>a verse</b> that <b>is written: “For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and fog the peoples; but the Lord shall shine upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you”</b> (Isaiah 60:2). |
| Isaiah 60:3 | end. As it is stated: “And nations shall walk in your light, and kings at the brightness of your rising” | Bava Batra75a:8 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the remaining</b> part of the skin of the leviathan, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, spreads it on the walls of Jerusalem, and its glory radiates from</b> one <b>end of the world until the</b> other <b>end. As it is stated: “And nations shall walk in your light, and kings at the brightness of your rising”</b> (Isaiah 60:3). |
| Isaiah 60:7 | they shall come up with acceptance upon My altar” | Avodah Zarah23b:3 | <b>And furthermore, it is explicitly taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues respond to him</b> with regard to his ruling that an animal purchased from gentiles may not be used as an offering? They quoted a verse: <b>“All flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto you,</b> the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto you; <b>they shall come up with acceptance upon My altar”</b> (Isaiah 60:7). Since the Rabbis learn from this verse that animals intended for use in all types of offerings may be purchased from gentiles, there is no reason to assume that they concede to Rabbi Eliezer. Consequently, Rabbi Pedat’s opinion that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, while the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, remains uncontroverted. |
| Isaiah 60:7 | “All flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto you, | Avodah Zarah24a:15 | <b>The other</b> one <b>of them began and said: What did Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues respond to him?</b> They quoted the verse: <b>“All flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto you,</b> the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto you; they shall come up with acceptance upon My altar” (Isaiah 60:7). This verse clearly indicates that offerings will be accepted from gentiles. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to them: In the future all</b> gentiles will <b>be calculating converts,</b> i.e., those who converted for personal gain, and as converts, they will not be suspected of engaging in bestiality. |
| Isaiah 60:8 | “Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes” | Bava Batra75b:6 | The Gemara continues to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And lest you say</b> that <b>there is discomfort in ascending</b> to a place so high, <b>the verse states</b> in a prophecy depicting the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem: <b>“Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes”</b> (Isaiah 60:8). This indicates that they can easily ascend to Jerusalem, as though they were clouds or doves. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Incidentally, one can <b>learn from</b> that statement that <b>this cloud</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is three parasangs high,</b> as it reaches Jerusalem, which will be raised three parasangs. |
| Isaiah 60:17 | your oppressors charity” | Bava Batra9a:14 | <b>Rava said to the people of Meḥoza: I beg of you, strive with each other</b> to perform acts of charity and righteousness, <b>so that you will</b> live in <b>peace with the government,</b> since if you do not act charitably toward each other, you will end up paying fines to the government. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: When the Temple is standing, a person contributes his shekel</b> for the Temple service <b>and achieves atonement</b> for his sins. <b>Now that the Temple no longer stands, if</b> people <b>act charitably,</b> it will be <b>well</b> for them; <b>but if not, the nations of the world will come and take</b> their money <b>by force.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And even so,</b> the money taken from them by force <b>is credited to them as</b> if they had freely given <b>charity, as it is stated:</b> “And I will make <b>your oppressors charity”</b> (Isaiah 60:17). |
| Isaiah 60:17 | as it is stated: “For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron” | Rosh Hashanah23a:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: Woe to the nations</b> of the world, <b>as they have no remedy</b> for the sins they committed against the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron”</b> (Isaiah 60:17). For all things there is a remedy, as one can always exchange them for an item of equivalent or greater value. However, <b>for Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues,</b> whom the nations put to death, <b>what can one bring</b> to atone for their sin? <b>And with regard to them it is stated: And I will hold</b> them <b>as innocent, but for their blood I will not hold</b> them <b>innocent</b> (see Joel 4:21). |
| Isaiah 60:17 | desacralization, as it is written: “In place of [ taḥat ] brass I will bring gold, | Temurah 27a:2 | Yet <i>taḥat</i> is also a term <b>that</b> indicates <b>desacralization, as it is written: “In place of [<i>taḥat</i>] brass I will bring gold,</b> and in place of iron I will bring silver, and in place of wood brass, and in place of stones iron” (Isaiah 60:17). In this verse, <i>taḥat</i> means replacement, which is what occurs in desacralization, where one item is replaced by another. <b>And therefore,</b> the term should be understood in accordance with the context: <b>With regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated</b> for sacrifice upon the <b>altar, which render</b> a non-sacred animal for which they are exchanged <b>a substitute,</b> <i>taḥat</i> <b>is a term that</b> indicates the <b>associating</b> of one sanctity with another. <b>With regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, which do not render</b> a non-sacred animal for which they are exchanged <b>a substitute,</b> <i>taḥat</i> <b>is a term that</b> indicates <b>desacralization.</b> |
| Isaiah 60:21 | Rava taught: “Your people are all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever; | Pesachim 53b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in th<i>e Tosefta</i>: <b>Both</b> in a place <b>where</b> the Sages <b>said to kindle and</b> in a place <b>where they said not to kindle, they both intended to</b> achieve the <b>same objective,</b> i.e., to distance people from sin, as conjugal relations are prohibited on Yom Kippur. Those who said that one kindles a lamp believe that because people do not engage in relations while a lamp is lit, the lamp will discourage intimacy. Those who maintain the opposite believe that spouses who are unable to see each other will not be tempted to engage in conjugal relations, and therefore it is preferable not to have a lamp lit on Yom Kippur. <b>Rav Yehoshua said</b> that <b>Rava taught: “Your people are all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever;</b> the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, in which I glory” (Isaiah 60:21). <b>Both</b> in a place <b>where</b> the Sages <b>said to kindle and</b> in a place <b>where they said not to kindle, they intended only to</b> achieve the <b>same objective,</b> fulfilling a mitzva. Even though different places have different customs, the Jewish people all aspire to sanctity. |
| Isaiah 60:21 | have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, for My name to be glorified” | Sanhedrin 90a:15 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All of the Jewish people,</b> even sinners and those who are liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty, <b>have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, for My name to be glorified”</b> (Isaiah 60:21). <b>And these</b> are the exceptions, the people <b>who have no share in the World-to-Come,</b> even when they fulfilled many mitzvot: <b>One who says: There is no resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah, and</b> one who says: The <b>Torah</b> did <b>not</b> originate <b>from Heaven, and an <i>epikoros</i>,</b> who treats Torah scholars and the Torah that they teach with contempt. |
| Isaiah 60:21 | in a generation that is entirely innocent, as it is written: “And your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever” | Sanhedrin 98a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The son of David will come only in a generation that is entirely innocent,</b> in which case they will be deserving of redemption, <b>or</b> in a generation that is <b>entirely guilty,</b> in which case there will be no alternative to redemption. He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely innocent, as it is written: “And your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever”</b> (Isaiah 60:21). He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely guilty, as it is written: “And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor;</b> therefore His arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness, it sustained Him” (Isaiah 59:16). <b>And it is written:</b> “For My own sake, <b>for My own sake will I do it;</b> for how should it be profaned? And My glory I will not give it to another” (Isaiah 48:11). |
| Isaiah 60:22 | about him: “I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time” | Bava Batra133b:3 | Rav Ilish <b>was embarrassed</b> by his mistake. To comfort him, Rav <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time”</b> (Isaiah 60:22), as if to say: It was due to Divine Providence that I was here to correct you before your mistaken ruling was implemented. |
| Isaiah 60:22 | Rabbi Alexandri says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction | Sanhedrin 98a:12 | § <b>Rabbi Alexandri says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction</b> in a verse addressing God’s commitment to redeem the Jewish people. In the verse: “I the Lord in its time I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22), <b>it is written: “In its time,”</b> indicating that there is a designated time for the redemption, <b>and it is written: “I will hasten it,”</b> indicating that there is no set time for the redemption. Rabbi Alexandri explains: <b>If they merit</b> redemption through repentance and good deeds <b>I will hasten</b> the coming of the Messiah. <b>If they do not merit</b> redemption, the coming of the Messiah will be <b>in its</b> designated <b>time.</b> |
| Isaiah 61:1 | of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Humility is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the humble” | Avodah Zarah20b:11 | <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Humility is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the humble”</b> (Isaiah 61:1). Since <b>the pious is not stated,</b> but <b>rather “the humble,” you learn that humility is greater than all of them.</b> |
| Isaiah 61:3 | as it is stated: “To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland in place of ashes” | Bava Batra60b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Above my highest [<i>rosh</i>] joy? Rav Yitzḥak says: This</b> is referring to the <b>burnt ashes</b> that are customarily placed <b>on the head [<i>rosh</i>] of bridegrooms</b> at the time of their wedding celebrations, to remember the destruction of the Temple. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Where are they placed?</b> Abaye replied: <b>On</b> the <b>place</b> where <b>phylacteries</b> are placed, <b>as it is stated: “To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland in place of ashes”</b> (Isaiah 61:3). Since phylacteries are referred to as a garland (see Ezekiel 24:17), it may be inferred from this verse that the ashes were placed in the same place as the phylacteries. |
| Isaiah 61:3 | as it is stated: “To appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them an ornament [ pe’er ] instead of ashes” | Taanit 16a:1 | <b>one who is humiliated by others.</b> Accordingly, ashes are placed on the heads of the leaders of the community by others, to increase the appearance of their suffering. The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> exactly <b>are</b> the ashes <b>placed</b> upon their heads? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: On the place</b> of the <b>phylacteries</b> of the head, <b>as it is stated: “To appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them an ornament [<i>pe’er</i>] instead of ashes”</b> (Isaiah 61:3). This verse likens the placement of ashes on one’s head to an ornament, and the term <i>pe’er</i> is traditionally interpreted as a reference to phylacteries. |
| Isaiah 61:5 | when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, | Berakhot 35b:7 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Is it possible that a person plows in the plowing season and sows in the sowing season and harvests in the harvest season and threshes in the threshing season and winnows in the windy season,</b> as grain is separated from the chaff by means of the wind, and is constantly busy; <b>what will become of Torah? Rather,</b> one must dedicate himself exclusively to Torah at the expense of other endeavors; as <b>when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks,</b> and foreigners will be your plowmen and your vinedressers” (Isaiah 61:5). <b>When Israel does not perform God’s will, their work is performed by them</b> themselves, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall gather your grain.” Moreover,</b> if Israel fails to perform God’s will, <b>others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy</b> whom God shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness and in want of all things” (Deuteronomy 28:48). |
| Isaiah 61:5 | As it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vineyard workers” | Pesachim 68a:15 | As we have been discussing the world of the future and the resurrection of the dead, the Gemara cites additional statements on these topics. <b>Ulla raised a contradiction</b> between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “He will destroy death forever,</b> and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the insult of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 25:8). <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written:</b> “There shall be no more there an infant who lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; <b>for the youngest shall die a hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20), implying that people will live long lives, but death will not be totally eradicated. Ulla answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring to <b>Jews,</b> who will not die at all, while <b>there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring to <b>gentiles,</b> who will live exceedingly long lives but eventually die. The Gemara asks: <b>What are gentiles doing there</b> in the future world? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vineyard workers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 61:5 | about whom it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and vinedressers” | Sanhedrin 91b:9 | <b>Ulla raises a contradiction. It is written: “He will swallow death forever; and the Lord</b> God <b>will wipe tears from all faces”</b> (Isaiah 25:8), indicating that death will no longer exist at the end of days. <b>And it is written: “There shall be no more an infant a few days old then…for the youngest shall die one hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20). The Gemara answers that this contradiction is <b>not difficult.</b> The verse <b>here,</b> in Isaiah chapter 25, is written <b>with regard to the Jewish people,</b> who will live forever after resurrection; the verse <b>there,</b> in Isaiah chapter 65, is written <b>with regard to gentiles,</b> who will ultimately die after an extremely long life. The Gemara asks: <b>And what do gentiles seek,</b> i.e., why will they merit to live, in <b>that</b> era? The Gemara answers that the verse is referring to <b>those</b> gentiles <b>about whom it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and vinedressers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 61:7 | With regard to the righteous, it is stated: “Therefore in their land they shall possess double” | Chagigah 15a:10 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>With regard to the righteous, it is stated: “Therefore in their land they shall possess double”</b> (Isaiah 61:7); whereas <b>with regard to the wicked, it is stated: “And destroy them with double destruction”</b> (Jeremiah 17:18); therefore, each receives a double portion. |
| Isaiah 61:8 | that which is written: “For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery in a burnt-offering” | Sukkah 30a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery in a burnt-offering”</b> (Isaiah 61:8)? The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who was passing by a customs house. He said to his servants: Pay the levy to the taxmen. They said to him: Doesn’t all the tax in its entirety belong to you?</b> If the taxes will ultimately reach the royal treasury, what is the point of paying the levy? <b>He said to them: From my</b> conduct, <b>all travelers will learn and will not evade</b> payment of <b>the tax. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “I the Lord... hate robbery in a burnt-offering.”</b> Although the whole world is His and the acquisitions of man have no impact upon Him, God says: <b>From My</b> conduct, <b>My children will learn and distance themselves from robbery,</b> even from robbery unrelated to the needs of offerings. |
| Isaiah 61:10 | As it is stated: “As a bridegroom decks himself [ yekhahen ] with a garland” | Moed Katan28b:27 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a groom reclines at the head</b> of the table? <b>As it is stated: “As a bridegroom decks himself [<i>yekhahen</i>] with a garland”</b> (Isaiah 61:10). <b>Just as a priest [<i>kohen</i>]</b> is <b>at the head</b> of the table, <b>so too, a bridegroom</b> is <b>at the head</b> of the table. |
| Isaiah 61:11 | as it is stated: “For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden causes its seeds to grow, | Shabbat 84b:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Gemara continues to discuss an additional <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in <b>a garden bed that is six by six handbreadths, that one may plant five</b> different types of <b>seeds in it?</b> He may do so without violating the prohibition of sowing a mixture of diverse kinds of seeds in the following manner. One sows <b>four</b> types of plants <b>on</b> each of <b>the four sides of the garden bed and one in the middle.</b> There is an allusion to this in the text, <b>as it is stated: “For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden causes its seeds to grow,</b> so will the Lord God cause justice and praise to spring forth before all the nations” (Isaiah 61:11). <b>Its seed,</b> in the singular, <b>is not stated; rather, its seeds,</b> written in the plural. Apparently, it is possible that several seeds may be planted in a small garden. |
| Isaiah 62:5 | As it is written: “For as a young man takes to himself [ yiv’al ] a virgin, | Moed Katan2a:8 | <b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit haba’al</i>,</b> a field that suffices with rainwater, <b>is a term denoting settlement,</b> i.e., an established field that does not require extensive upkeep? <b>As it is written: “For as a young man takes to himself [<i>yiv’al</i>] a virgin,</b> so shall your sons take you to themselves” (Isaiah 62:5). <b>And it is translated</b> in the Aramaic translation: <b>As a young man settles down with a virgin, so shall your sons become settled within you.</b> Similarly, <i>beit haba’al</i> is referring to a settled field that suffices with rainwater. |
| Isaiah 62:5 | seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you” | Sanhedrin 99a:9 | <b>Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught: The messianic era for the Jewish people</b> will last <b>seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you”</b> (Isaiah 62:5). The bridegroom rejoices over the bride for seven days, and the day of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is one thousand years. |
| Isaiah 62:6 | is written: “I have set watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day nor night; those who remind the Lord, take no rest” | Menachot 87a:18 | The chapter concludes by quoting an additional prophecy of Isaiah concerning the rebuilding of Eretz Yisrael: It <b>is written: “I have set watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day nor night; those who remind the Lord, take no rest”</b> (Isaiah 62:6). This is referring to the angels appointed by God to bring the redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> do these watchmen <b>say</b> to remind the Lord? <b>This</b> is what <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said:</b> They recite the verse: <b>“You will arise and have compassion upon Zion;</b> for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come” (Psalms 102:14). |
| Isaiah 62:8 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wears phylacteries? As it is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength” | Berakhot 6a:17 | The Gemara cites another aggadic statement: <b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wears phylacteries? As it is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). Since it is customary to swear upon holy objects, it is understood that His right hand and the arm of His strength are the holy objects upon which God swore. |
| Isaiah 62:8 | is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand” | Nazir 3b:8 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>Say no,</b> it is <b>because</b> the <b>right</b> hand <b>itself is called an oath, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: Right, that it is an oath?</b> It is derived from the verse where it <b>is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: Left, that it is an oath?</b> It is derived from the continuation of that verse, where it <b>is stated: “And by the arm of His strength”</b> (Isaiah 62:8). Since this is the complementary phrase for the right hand, it must refer to the left hand. It is clear from here that both right and left are themselves expressions of an oath and do not indicate an oath merely because they are juxtaposed in a verse to an expression of an oath. |
| Isaiah 63:1 | Reish Lakish says: The angel of Rome is destined to make three errors, as it is written: “Who is this who comes from Edom, with crimsoned garments from Bozrah?” | Makkot 12a:4 | Apropos errors, the Gemara cites that <b>Reish Lakish says: The angel of Rome is destined to make three errors, as it is written: “Who is this who comes from Edom, with crimsoned garments from Bozrah?”</b> (Isaiah 63:1), which is a parable for God’s arrival after killing the angel of Rome in Bozrah. The angel of Rome will <b>err</b> in <b>that</b> it is <b>only</b> the city of <b>Bezer</b> that <b>provides refuge and he exiled</b> himself <b>to Bozrah;</b> he will <b>err</b> in <b>that it provides refuge only</b> to <b>an unintentional</b> murderer <b>and he was</b> an <b>intentional</b> murderer; and he will <b>err</b> in <b>that it provides refuge only</b> to <b>a person and he is an angel.</b> |
| Isaiah 63:3 | “Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Isaiah 63:3 | states: “And their eternity [ nitzḥam ] is dashed against My garments, and I have redeemed all My raiment” | Chullin 92a:12 | <b>“Its blossoms [<i>nitzah</i>] shot forth”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be redeemed. And similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And their eternity [<i>nitzḥam</i>] is dashed against My garments, and I have redeemed all My raiment”</b> (Isaiah 63:3). <b>“And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for Egypt to drink the cup of fury,</b> i.e., to receive its punishment. |
| Isaiah 63:4 | as it is stated: “For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come” | Sanhedrin 99a:7 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>365 years, corresponding to the number of days of the solar</b> year, <b>as it is stated: “For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come”</b> (Isaiah 63:4). |
| Isaiah 63:9 | “In all their affliction He was [ lo ] afflicted” | Sotah 31a:4 | The Gemara counters: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that</b> the word <i>lo</i> <b>is written <i>lamed alef</i>,</b> its meaning <b>is: Not? If that is so,</b> then in the verse: <b>“In all their affliction He was [<i>lo</i>] afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 63:9), <b>where</b> the word <i>lo</i> <b>is written <i>lamed alef</i>, so too, does it</b> mean: <b>Not,</b> i.e., God was not afflicted in the afflictions of the Jewish people? |
| Isaiah 63:9 | “In all their affliction, He was afflicted” | Taanit 16a:5 | The Gemara further asks: <b>And why do they cover themselves in sackcloth? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said:</b> This is as though <b>to say: We are considered</b> before You <b>like animals,</b> which are likewise covered with hide. <b>And why do they place burnt ashes on top of the ark? Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said:</b> This is <b>as though to say</b> in God’s name: <b>“I will be with him in trouble”</b> (Psalms 91:15). <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the same idea can be derived from a different verse: <b>“In all their affliction, He was afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 63:9). By placing burnt ash on the ark, which is the symbol of the Divine Presence, it is as though God Himself joins the Jews in their pain. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: At first, when I saw the Sages place burnt ashes upon the ark, my entire body trembled</b> from the intensity of the event. |
| Isaiah 63:15 | is called heaven? As it is written: “Look down from heaven and see, from Your holy and glorious abode [ Zevul ]” | Chagigah 12b:6 | <b><i>Zevul</i>,</b> abode, <b>is</b> the location <b>of</b> the heavenly <b>Jerusalem and</b> the heavenly <b>Temple, and</b> there the heavenly <b>altar is built, and</b> the angel <b>Michael, the great minister, stands and sacrifices an offering upon it, as it is stated: “I have surely built a house of <i>Zevul</i> for You, a place for You to dwell forever”</b> (I Kings 8:13). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> <i>Zevul</i> <b>is called heaven? As it is written: “Look down from heaven and see, from Your holy and glorious abode [<i>Zevul</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 63:15). |
| Isaiah 63:16 | which is written: “For You are our Father; for Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us; You, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer, everlasting is Your name” | Shabbat 89b:4 | Apropos the Jewish people assessing their forefathers, the Gemara cites a related teaching. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For You are our Father; for Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us; You, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer, everlasting is Your name”</b> (Isaiah 63:16)? <b>In the future</b> that will surely <b>come, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will say to Abraham: Your children have sinned against Me.</b> Abraham will <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> if so, <b>let them be eradicated to sanctify Your name.</b> God <b>said: I will say it to Jacob.</b> Since he experienced <b>the pain of raising children,</b> perhaps <b>he will ask for mercy on their behalf.</b> He <b>said to</b> Jacob: <b>Your children have sinned.</b> Jacob <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> if so, <b>let them be eradicated to sanctify Your name.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said: There is no reason in elders and no wisdom in youth.</b> Neither Abraham nor Jacob knew how to respond properly. He <b>said to Isaac: Your children have sinned against Me.</b> Isaac <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> are they <b>my children and not Your children? At</b> Sinai, <b>when they accorded precedence to “We will do” over “We will listen” before You,</b> didn’t You <b>call them, “My son, My firstborn son</b> Israel” (Exodus 4:22)? <b>Now</b> that they have sinned, are they <b>my children and not Your children?</b> |
| Isaiah 64:1 | water, as it is written: “As when fire ignites brushwood; fire boils [ tiveh ] water” | Bava Kamma4b:2 | § <b>Rav Mari objects to</b> the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <i>Maveh</i> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b><i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is <b>the</b> primary category of damage caused by <b>water, as it is written: “As when fire ignites brushwood; fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water”</b> (Isaiah 64:1). The terms <i>tiveh</i> and <i>maveh</i> share a common root, and the reference is to water. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse: <b>Water boils [<i>nivu</i>]</b> from fire, with water, a plural noun in Hebrew, the subject of the intransitive plural verb, <i>nivu</i>? No, <b>“fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water” is written,</b> and since <i>tiveh</i> is a transitive singular verb, the subject is fire, which is a singular noun. Therefore, no proof can be adduced from this verse that <i>Maveh</i> refers to an action performed with water. |
| Isaiah 64:3 | “no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him” | Avodah Zarah65a:5 | <b>Rav Pappi said:</b> Rava <b>should have said</b> a response <b>to him from this verse: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir”</b> (Psalms 45:10), indicating that in the World-to-Come, the daughters of kings will serve the Jewish people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: He should have said</b> a response <b>to him from here:</b> The reward of the Jewish people will be such that <b>“no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). |
| Isaiah 64:3 | no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, who will do for those who await Him” | Berakhot 34b:18 | In conclusion of this discussion, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to the reward of the righteous: <b>All the prophets only prophesied</b> in their prophecies of consolation, <b>with regard to one who</b> values wisdom and therefore <b>marries his daughter to a Torah scholar and to one who conducts business [<i>perakmatya</i>] on behalf of a Torah scholar as well as to one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit a Torah scholar</b> in some other way. <b>However,</b> the prophets did not describe the extent of the reward for <b>Torah scholars themselves,</b> whose reward is not quantifiable as it is stated: “And from of old they have not heard, they have not lent an ear, <b>no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). |
| Isaiah 64:3 | “No eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him” | Sanhedrin 99a:12 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In their prophecies with regard to redemption and the end of days, <b>all the prophets prophesied only about the messianic era, but with regard to the World-to-Come</b> the reward is not quantifiable, as it states: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: The</b> difference <b>between this world and the messianic era is only</b> with regard to <b>servitude to</b> foreign <b>kingdoms alone,</b> as they will leave Eretz Yisrael. |
| Isaiah 64:3 | “No eye sees, God, except You, | Shabbat 63a:11 | However, <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who disagrees with Shmuel. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: All of the prophets only prophesied with regard to the messianic era; however, with regard to the World-to-Come</b> it was stated: <b>“No eye sees, God, except You,</b> that which He will do for he that waits for Him” (Isaiah 64:3). What will be in the World-to-Come cannot be depicted even by means of prophecy. |
| Isaiah 64:4 | from here: “You took him away who joyfully performed righteousness, those who remembered You in Your ways, behold You were wroth, and we sinned, upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved” | Taanit 8a:17 | <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “You took him away who joyfully performed righteousness, those who remembered You in Your ways, behold You were wroth, and we sinned, upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved”</b> (Isaiah 64:4). This verse also teaches that God displays wrath specifically due to the transgressions of those who are accustomed to acting righteously. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> concerning the same verse: <b>Whoever is joyful in</b> the <b>suffering</b> that comes upon him <b>brings salvation to the world [<i>olam</i>], as it is stated: “Upon them have we stayed of old [<i>olam</i>], that we might be saved.”</b> |
| Isaiah 64:5 | “And all our charity is as a polluted garment” | Bava Batra9b:1 | <b>who perverted the ways of his mother.</b> He said <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And He donned charity like a coat of mail”</b> (Isaiah 59:17)? This verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>this coat of mail, each and every scale</b> of which it is fashioned <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large coat of mail, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i></b> that one gives <b>combines to</b> form <b>a great sum. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The same idea is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And all our charity is as a polluted garment”</b> (Isaiah 64:5). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this garment, each and every thread</b> in it <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large garment, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i> combines to</b> form <b>a great sum.</b> |
| Isaiah 64:9 | Rabbi Elazar said: One who sees the cities of Judea in their desolation says: “Your sacred cities are become a wilderness” | Moed Katan26a:23 | <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Ulla Bira’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who sees the cities of Judea in their desolation says: “Your sacred cities are become a wilderness”</b> (Isaiah 64:9), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments. One who sees <b>Jerusalem in its desolation says: “Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation”</b> (Isaiah 64:9), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments. One who sees <b>the Temple in its desolation says: “Our sacred and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste” (</b>Isaiah 64:10), <b>and</b> then <b>rends</b> his garments. |
| Isaiah 64:9 | Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Zion is become a wilderness, | Rosh Hashanah23a:11 | With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Each and every acacia tree that the gentiles took from Jerusalem will be returned to</b> the city <b>by the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree</b> and myrtle and the oil tree; I will set in the desert cypress, the plane tree and the larch together” (Isaiah 41:19). <b>And</b> the term <b>wilderness</b> is referring to <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Zion is become a wilderness,</b> Jerusalem a desolation” (Isaiah 64:9). |
| Isaiah 65:3 | idol worship, as it is stated: “A people that angers Me before Me continually; | Bava Metzia59a:8 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> There are <b>three</b> sins <b>before</b> whose transgressors <b>the curtain [<i>hapargod</i>]</b> between the world and the Divine Presence <b>is not locked;</b> their sins reach the Divine Presence. They are: Verbal <b>mistreatment, robbery, and idol worship. Mistreatment, as it is stated: “And a plumb line in His hand”; robbery, as it is stated: “Violence and robbery are heard in her, they are before Me continually”</b> (Jeremiah 6:7); <b>idol worship, as it is stated: “A people that angers Me before Me continually;</b> that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks” (Isaiah 65:3). |
| Isaiah 65:5 | You shall not withdraw, as it is written: “Those who say: Withdraw [ kerav ] to yourself, come not near to me, for I am holier than you” | Shevuot 18b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>a positive mitzva</b> with regard to the manner in which one must withdraw from a menstruating woman; <b>from where do we</b> derive that immediate withdrawal is also subject to <b>a prohibition? Rav Pappa said: The verse states:</b> “And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness <b>you shall not approach,</b> to uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:19). The Gemara explains: <b>“You shall not approach [<i>tikrav</i>]”</b> means <b>also</b> the opposite: <b>You shall not withdraw, as it is written: “Those who say: Withdraw [<i>kerav</i>] to yourself, come not near to me, for I am holier than you”</b> (Isaiah 65:5), where “<i>kerav</i>” means remove or withdraw. |
| Isaiah 65:11 | as it is written: “That prepare a table for Gad” | Sanhedrin 63b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does this mean that <b>if</b> an idol <b>is not written</b> in the Torah, it is <b>not</b> permitted to mention its name? <b>Rav Mesharshiyya raises an objection</b> to this premise from a mishna in tractate <i>Zavim</i> (1:5): If a man <b>saw,</b> i.e., experienced, <b>one</b> gonorrhea-like discharge that lasted <b>as long as three</b> regular gonorrhea-like discharges, <b>which is like</b> the amount of time it takes to walk <b>from</b> the location of the idol <b>Gadyon to Shiloh, which is</b> the amount of time it takes to perform <b>two immersions and two dryings</b> with a towel, <b>he is</b> ritually impure with the impurity status of <b>a full-fledged <i>zav</i>,</b> even though a man generally becomes a <i>zav</i> only after three separate discharges. In any event, the mishna mentions the idol Gadyon. <b>Ravina says:</b> The idol <b>Gad is also written</b> in the Bible; <b>as it is written: “That prepare a table for Gad”</b> (Isaiah 65:11). |
| Isaiah 65:11 | on his table, it is as if he worships idols, as it is stated: “Who prepare a table for Fortune [ Gad ] and offer blended wine for Destiny” | Sanhedrin 92a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who leaves pieces</b> of bread <b>on his table, it is as if he worships idols, as it is stated: “Who prepare a table for Fortune [<i>Gad</i>] and offer blended wine for Destiny”</b> (Isaiah 65:11). The people would leave pieces of bread on the table as an offering to the constellation <i>Gad</i>, which they believed influences the fortune of the home. This practice was a form of idol worship. The Gemara answers: This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult: This</b> case, where leaving pieces of bread is a form of idol worship, applies <b>when there is a whole</b> loaf together <b>with</b> the pieces, as the addition of the pieces is clearly for idol worship; <b>that</b> case, where failure to leave bread on the table is criticized, applies <b>when there is no whole</b> loaf together <b>with</b> the pieces. |
| Isaiah 65:11 | that prepare a table for Gad , | Shabbat 67b:1 | After some discussion of the ways of the Amorite, the Gemara cites additional statements from the Amorite chapter in the <i>Tosefta</i> and from other sources on this topic. <b>One who says: My fortune be fortunate [<i>gad gaddi</i>] and be not weary by day or by night;</b> that statement <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> That is more severe than the ways of the Amorite, as <b><i>gad</i> is nothing other than a term of idolatry, as it is stated:</b> “And you that forsake the Lord, that forget My holy mountain, <b>that prepare a table for <i>Gad</i>,</b> and that offer mingled wine in full measure unto <i>Meni</i>” (Isaiah 65:11). <i>Gad gaddi</i> is a form of prayer to an idol. |
| Isaiah 65:20 | for the youngest shall die a hundred years old” | Pesachim 68a:15 | As we have been discussing the world of the future and the resurrection of the dead, the Gemara cites additional statements on these topics. <b>Ulla raised a contradiction</b> between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “He will destroy death forever,</b> and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the insult of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 25:8). <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written:</b> “There shall be no more there an infant who lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; <b>for the youngest shall die a hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20), implying that people will live long lives, but death will not be totally eradicated. Ulla answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first verse, it is referring to <b>Jews,</b> who will not die at all, while <b>there,</b> in the second verse, it is referring to <b>gentiles,</b> who will live exceedingly long lives but eventually die. The Gemara asks: <b>What are gentiles doing there</b> in the future world? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vineyard workers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 65:20 | And it is written: “There shall be no more an infant a few days old then…for the youngest shall die one hundred years old” | Sanhedrin 91b:9 | <b>Ulla raises a contradiction. It is written: “He will swallow death forever; and the Lord</b> God <b>will wipe tears from all faces”</b> (Isaiah 25:8), indicating that death will no longer exist at the end of days. <b>And it is written: “There shall be no more an infant a few days old then…for the youngest shall die one hundred years old”</b> (Isaiah 65:20). The Gemara answers that this contradiction is <b>not difficult.</b> The verse <b>here,</b> in Isaiah chapter 25, is written <b>with regard to the Jewish people,</b> who will live forever after resurrection; the verse <b>there,</b> in Isaiah chapter 65, is written <b>with regard to gentiles,</b> who will ultimately die after an extremely long life. The Gemara asks: <b>And what do gentiles seek,</b> i.e., why will they merit to live, in <b>that</b> era? The Gemara answers that the verse is referring to <b>those</b> gentiles <b>about whom it is written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and vinedressers”</b> (Isaiah 61:5). |
| Isaiah 65:25 | “And dust shall be the serpent’s food” | Yoma 75a:3 | § Another verse states: <b>“And dust shall be the serpent’s food”</b> (Isaiah 65:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: Even if</b> the serpent <b>eats all the delicacies in the world, they will</b> still <b>taste like dust. And one said: Even if it eats all the delicacies in the world, its mind is unsettled until it</b> also <b>eats</b> some <b>dust.</b> |
| Isaiah 66:1 | as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool” | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Isaiah 66:1 | and make a seat afterward? As it is stated: “So said the Lord: The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool” | Chagigah 12a:17 | <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: According to your words,</b> does <b>a person build a second floor and build</b> the first floor of <b>the house afterward? As it is stated: “It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heaven, and has founded His vault upon the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), indicating that the upper floor, heaven, was built above the earth. <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: According to your words,</b> does <b>a person make a stool</b> for his feet, <b>and make a seat afterward? As it is stated: “So said the Lord: The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> Both <b>this and that were created as one, for it is stated: “Indeed, My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand up together”</b> (Isaiah 48:13), implying that they were created as one. |
| Isaiah 66:1 | for His footstool, as it is stated: “The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool” | Chagigah 14a:6 | The Gemara asks: Did Rabbi Akiva <b>accept</b> this rebuff <b>from him, or did he not accept</b> it <b>from him?</b> The Gemara offers a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following teaching of a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> throne is <b>for judgment and one</b> is <b>for righteousness;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to him: Akiva, what are you doing</b> occupying yourself <b>with</b> the study of <b><i>aggada</i>?</b> This is not your field of expertise. <b>Take [<i>kelakh</i>] your words to</b> the topics of <b>plagues and tents.</b> Meaning, it is preferable that you teach the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of leprosy and the impurity of the dead, which are within your field of expertise. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to the two thrones: <b>One</b> throne is <b>for a seat and one</b> is <b>for a small seat.</b> The <b>seat</b> is <b>to sit on,</b> and the <b>small seat</b> is <b>for His footstool, as it is stated: “The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Isaiah 66:1 | the feet of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool” | Chagigah 16a:12 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This is</b> one <b>who commits a transgression in private, in accordance with Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Whoever commits a transgression in private, it is as though he pushed</b> away <b>the feet of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). If one believes that no one can see what he is doing in private, it is as though he said that God is absent from that place. He is therefore compared to one who attempts to remove God from His footstool. |
| Isaiah 66:1 | As it is stated: “So says the Lord: The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool” | Kiddushin 31a:2 | <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: When a person causes his father and mother suffering, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: I did well in not dwelling among them, for if I had dwelled among them they would have caused Me suffering</b> as well, as it were. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Anyone who transgresses in private, it is</b> considered <b>as though he is pushing away the feet of the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., he distances God from him, so to speak. <b>As it is stated: “So says the Lord: The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). When someone sins in secret, he demonstrates that he thinks God is absent from that place, and it is as though he pushes His feet away from the earth. |
| Isaiah 66:1 | it is written: “Thus says the Lord: The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that you may build for Me? | Sanhedrin 7a:15 | <b>And it is written: “And the house that King Solomon built for the Lord, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height thirty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:2). <b>And at the end,</b> when Israel sinned, the whole of the space of the Temple was not expansive enough for the Divine Presence to rest within it, as <b>it is written: “Thus says the Lord: The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that you may build for Me?</b> And where is the place that may be My resting place?” (Isaiah 66:1). In times of discord, the Temple is an insufficient resting place for the Divine Presence. |
| Isaiah 66:5 | which is written: | Bava Metzia33b:4 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word: Your brothers that hate you, that ostracize you for My name’s sake, have said: Let the Lord be glorified, that we may gaze upon your joy, but they shall be ashamed” (Isaiah 66:5)? <b>“Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word,” these are Torah scholars; “your brothers…have said,” these are masters of the Bible,</b> who are aware of their shortcomings and treat the Torah scholars with deference; <b>“that hate you,” these are masters of Mishna,</b> who consider themselves the equals of Torah scholars and resent the fact that the Torah scholars do not treat them as equals; <b>“that ostracize you,” these are ignoramuses,</b> who distance themselves with their actions from the Torah scholars. |
| Isaiah 66:10 | merit and see its joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, | Bava Batra60b:18 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And anyone who mourns for</b> the destruction of <b>Jerusalem</b> will <b>merit and see its joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem,</b> and be glad with her, all that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all that mourn for her” (Isaiah 66:10). |
| Isaiah 66:10 | because they did not mourn for Jerusalem, as it is written: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her, rejoice with joy with her, all you that did mourn for her” | Gittin 57a:20 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But since</b> those in the city <b>were so righteous, what is the reason that they were punished</b> and destroyed? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>because they did not mourn for Jerusalem, as it is written: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her, rejoice with joy with her, all you that did mourn for her”</b> (Isaiah 66:10). The verse teaches that one who mourns for Jerusalem will rejoice in its rebuilding, and one who fails to mourn for Jerusalem is destroyed. |
| Isaiah 66:10 | joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad with her, all who love her; rejoice for joy with her, all who mourn for her” | Taanit 30b:4 | <b>And the Sages say: Whoever performs labor on the Ninth of Av and does not mourn for Jerusalem will not see her</b> future <b>joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad with her, all who love her; rejoice for joy with her, all who mourn for her”</b> (Isaiah 66:10). <b>From here it is stated: Whoever mourns for Jerusalem will merit and see her</b> future <b>joy, and whoever does not mourn for Jerusalem will not see her future joy. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whoever eats meat or drinks wine in</b> the meal before <b>the Ninth of Av, about him the verse states: “And whose iniquities are upon their bones,</b> because the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living” (Ezekiel 32:27). |
| Isaiah 66:12 | A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river” | Berakhot 56b:8 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3). |
| Isaiah 66:15 | said to him: He immersed in fire, as it is written: “For, behold, the Lord will come in fire” | Sanhedrin 39a:15 | Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: He immersed in fire, as it is written: “For, behold, the Lord will come in fire”</b> (Isaiah 66:15). The heretic said to him: <b>But is immersion in fire effective?</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: On the contrary, the main</b> form of <b>immersion is in fire, as it is written</b> with regard to the removal of non-kosher substances absorbed in a vessel: <b>“And all that abides not the fire you shall make to go through the water”</b> (Numbers 31:23), indicating that fire purifies more than water does. |
| Isaiah 66:15 | it is written: “For behold, the Lord will come in fire” | Sotah 11a:9 | His advisors asked: <b>With what</b> form of death <b>shall we judge</b> and decree upon <b>them?</b> If <b>we shall judge them with fire,</b> perhaps we will be punished measure for measure by fire, as <b>it is written: “For behold, the Lord will come in fire”</b> (Isaiah 66:15), and <b>it is written</b> in the verse that follows it: <b>“For by fire will the Lord contend”</b> (Isaiah 66:16). Similarly, we cannot judge them <b>with the sword,</b> as <b>it is written</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“And by His sword with all flesh”</b> (Isaiah 66:16). |
| Isaiah 66:16 | “For by fire will the Lord contend” | Sotah 11a:9 | His advisors asked: <b>With what</b> form of death <b>shall we judge</b> and decree upon <b>them?</b> If <b>we shall judge them with fire,</b> perhaps we will be punished measure for measure by fire, as <b>it is written: “For behold, the Lord will come in fire”</b> (Isaiah 66:15), and <b>it is written</b> in the verse that follows it: <b>“For by fire will the Lord contend”</b> (Isaiah 66:16). Similarly, we cannot judge them <b>with the sword,</b> as <b>it is written</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“And by His sword with all flesh”</b> (Isaiah 66:16). |
| Isaiah 66:16 | as it is stated: “For by fire will the Lord contend, | Zevachim 116a:24 | The kings <b>said to him: He will not bring a flood of water,</b> as he vowed, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>He will bring a flood of fire,</b> as in the future the Lord will punish the nations with fire, <b>as it is stated: “For by fire will the Lord contend,</b> and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many” (Isaiah 66:16). Balaam <b>said to them: He already took an oath that He will not destroy all flesh</b> in any manner, as it is stated: “To destroy all flesh” (Genesis 9:15). Therefore, there will not be a flood of fire. |
| Isaiah 66:23 | shall all flesh come to worship | Sotah 5a:18 | <b>Ḥizkiyya says: The prayers of a person are heard only if he casts his heart</b> to be <b>like flesh,</b> by being free of arrogance. <b>As it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that from one New Moon to another,</b> and from one Sabbath to another, <b>shall all flesh come to worship</b> before Me, says the Lord” (Isaiah 66:23). |
| Isaiah 66:24 | Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say: The wicked do not repent, even at the entrance to Gehenna, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who rebel against Me; | Eruvin 19a:6 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say: The wicked do not repent, even at the entrance to Gehenna, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who rebel against Me;</b> for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24)? The verse <b>does not say: Who rebelled, but</b> rather: <b>“Who rebel,”</b> in the present tense, meaning <b>they continue rebelling forever.</b> |
| Isaiah 66:24 | Rabbi Yosei says: The fire that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created on the second day of the week will never be extinguished, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, nor will their fire be extinguished; | Pesachim 54a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And was its fire created on Shabbat eve? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The fire that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created on the second day of the week will never be extinguished, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, nor will their fire be extinguished;</b> and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24)? <b>And Rabbi Bana’a, son</b> of <b>Rabbi Ulla, said: Why doesn’t the verse state: That it was good,</b> at the end of the <b>second day of the week</b> of Creation, as it does on the other days? It is <b>because on</b> that day <b>the fire of Gehenna was created. And Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>even though: That it was good, was not stated with regard to</b> the creations of the second day, <b>He later included it</b> on the <b>sixth day, as it is stated: “And God saw all that He had done and behold, it was very good”</b> (Genesis 1:31). |
| Isaiah 66:24 | descend to Gehenna and are judged there for generations and generations, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me; | Rosh Hashanah17a:4 | <b>But the heretics; and the informers; and the apostates [<i>apikorsim</i>];</b> and those <b>who denied the Torah; and</b> those who <b>denied the resurrection of the dead; and</b> those who <b>separated from the ways of</b> the Jewish <b>community</b> and refused to share the suffering; <b>and</b> those <b>who cast their fear over the land of the living; and</b> those who <b>sinned and caused the masses to sin, for example, Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and his company;</b> all of these people <b>descend to Gehenna and are judged there for generations and generations, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me;</b> for their worm shall not die; neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24). |
| Isaiah 66:24 | With regard to the attribute of punishment it is written: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” | Sanhedrin 100b:2 | <b>With regard to the attribute of punishment it is written: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh”</b> (Isaiah 66:24). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it not so</b> that when <b>a person extends his finger into the fire in this world, he is immediately burned?</b> How, then, can one withstand the fire of Gehenna, which is never extinguished? <b>Rather, just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, provides strength to the wicked to receive their punishment, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, provides strength to the righteous to receive their reward,</b> His handful. |
