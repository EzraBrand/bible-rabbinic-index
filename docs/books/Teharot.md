| Teharot 1:1 | its intent? But didn’t we learn | Bekhorot 10a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the Rabbis, did</b> they actually <b>say</b> that an item is susceptible to the impurity of food <b>since its prohibition</b> serves as <b>its intent? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:1) that the Sages <b>stated thirteen matters concerning the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, and this is one of them: It requires</b> explicit <b>intent</b> that it will be eaten in order to become susceptible to the impurity of food, as most gentiles are unaccustomed to eating it, <b>but it does not require</b> contact with liquid to be <b>rendered</b> susceptible to ritual impurity. |
| Teharot 1:1 | Rava said: We learn | Niddah 50b:2 | <b>Rava said: We learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:1) <b>as well: Thirteen matters were stated with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird, and this is one of them:</b> In order for such a carcass to be susceptible to impurity and to be capable of imparting impurity to food through contact, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intention</b> to eat it, <b>but it does not require</b> exposure to liquid to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. Even if one had intent to eat the bird while it was still alive, intent is still required after it became a carcass for it to transmit impurity. Rava concludes: <b>Evidently, intent</b> that the bird be eaten while the bird is <b>alive is not considered intent. Here too, intent</b> to designate produce while it is <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>is not considered intent.</b> |
| Teharot 1:1 | raised an objection to | Zevachim 105b:2 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Abba bar Shmuel, based on a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:1): <b>Thirteen matters were stated with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird, and this is one of them:</b> In order to be susceptible to impurity as a food, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intention</b> that it be eaten; <b>and it does not need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to such impurity by contact with liquid; <b>and it transmits ritual impurity of food in</b> the amount of <b>an egg-bulk.</b> In accordance with whose opinion is this mishna? <b>What, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> If so, he holds that an egg-bulk of a carcass of a kosher bird is necessary to transmit impurity. |
| Teharot 1:2 | elsewhere | Chullin 121a:11 | §The mishna stated that the horns join together with the flesh to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food. The Gemara comments that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 1:2): <b>The beak and the talons</b> of a bird that come into contact with a creeping animal can <b>become impure, and transmit impurity</b> to food, <b>and join together</b> with the attached flesh to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. The Gemara asks: Why does <b>a beak</b> join together with the flesh to impart impurity? <b>It is merely wood,</b> i.e., it is unfit for consumption. |
| Teharot 1:3 | as well | Chullin 102a:15 | <b>Rav Sheizvi said: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that a gentile is prohibited from eating a limb from a living being even with regard to non-kosher species (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted for consumption. |
| Teharot 1:3 | Rav Amram raises an objection | Chullin 102a:19 | <b>Rav Amram raises an objection</b> from the mishna cited above (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur the forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require an olive-bulk</b> in order for one to receive lashes for eating a limb severed from a living creature, that mishna must be referring to such a case; therefore, it should <b>emerge</b> that he is liable to receive lashes <b>because he ate an olive-bulk</b> of a non-kosher bird. |
| Teharot 1:5 | As we learned | Zevachim 31a:4 | <b>Rava said: From where,</b> i.e., based on what, <b>do I state</b> my ruling? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:5): <b>An egg-bulk of food</b> with <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>and an egg-bulk of food</b> with second-degree impurity <b>that one mixed together</b> are collectively considered to have <b>first-</b>degree impurity. If one <b>separated them</b> into two portions, each containing a homogenous mixture, <b>this</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity <b>and that</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity. Since neither of them contains the requisite amount of food with first-degree impurity, each mixture settles to the lower level of impurity between the two foods. Rava reasoned: <b>But</b> if one <b>mixed them again,</b> they revert to <b>be</b> of <b>first-</b>degree impurity. |
| Teharot 2:1 | a woman who pickles a vegetable in a pot, | Taanit 24b:1 | <b>was</b> connected to the order <b>of <i>Nezikin</i>,</b> while they were largely unfamiliar with the rest of the Mishna, <b>and we learn</b> all <b>six orders</b> of the Mishna. <b>And when Rav Yehuda reached</b> tractate <b><i>Uktzin</i>,</b> which discusses the extent to which various fruits and vegetables are considered an integral part of the produce in terms of becoming ritually impure, which is the basis for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a woman who pickles a vegetable in a pot,</b> etc. (<i>Teharot</i> 2:1), <b>and some say</b> that when he reached the <i>halakha</i> that <b>olives that are pickled with their leaves are ritually pure,</b> etc., as they are no longer considered part of the fruit (<i>Uktzin</i> 2:1), <b>he would say:</b> Those are <b>the disputes between Rav and Shmuel that we see here.</b> He felt it was an extremely challenging passage, as difficult as the most complex arguments between Rav and Shmuel. |
| Teharot 2:2 | Rabbi Yehoshua, as it is taught | Chullin 33b:14 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said</b> a third explanation of the mishna: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food. <b>And</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:2): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who eats food</b> with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity assumes <b>first-degree</b> impurity. One who eats food with <b>second-degree</b> ritual impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity. One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>third-degree</b> impurity. |
| Teharot 2:2 | as we learned | Sotah 30a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> is of this opinion, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:2): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who eats food</b> with <b>first-</b>degree impurity assumes <b>first-</b>degree impurity. One who eats food with <b>second-</b>degree impurity assumes <b>second-</b>degree impurity. One who eats food with <b>third-</b>degree impurity assumes <b>third-</b>degree impurity. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who eats food</b> with <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>or</b> food with <b>second-</b>degree impurity assumes <b>second-</b>degree impurity. One who eats food with <b>third-</b>degree impurity assumes <b>second-</b>degree impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> he does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-</b>degree impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Teharot 2:3 | Ulla | Chullin 34b:9 | <b>Rav Hamnuna raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Ulla</b> from a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:3): <b>Non-sacred</b> food that is impure with <b>first-degree</b> impurity is <b>impure and renders</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>impure</b> in the sense that this <i>teruma</i> disqualifies other <i>teruma</i> with which it comes into contact. Non-sacred food that is impure with <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>disqualifies</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> render <i>teruma</i> <b>impure,</b> meaning that it renders the <i>teruma</i> itself impure, but not to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> can render other <i>teruma</i> impure. <b>And</b> food that is impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity may be <b>eaten</b> by a priest <b>in a stew</b> that is <b>a mixture</b> containing spices of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Teharot 2:7 | as it is taught | Sotah 30a:10 | <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> is of this opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:7): <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>three of these</b> are <b>equal</b> in their ability to impart ritual impurity to other items: An item of <b>first-</b>degree impurity, whether it is an item <b>of sacrificial</b> food, <b>or of non-sacred</b> food, <b>or of <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Teharot 3:2 | with regard to wine, as we learned | Menachot 31a:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to wine, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:2): <b>Rabbi Meir says: Oil,</b> an example of a liquid, that contracted impurity, is <b>always</b> considered to have <b>first</b>-degree ritual impurity, even if it came into contact with an item that was impure with second-degree ritual impurity, which, according to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, should result in it having third-degree ritual impurity. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to <b>honey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to <b>wine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> is that to say <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>wine</b> is <b>not</b> considered a liquid? Rather, <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Wine</b> is considered a liquid, but oil and honey are not. |
| Teharot 3:5 | But didn’t we learn | Niddah 4a:11 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:5): With regard to a previously impure <b>needle that is found</b> on top of <i>teruma</i> and it is <b>full of rust or broken,</b> and therefore no longer contracts or transmit ritual impurity, the <i>teruma</i> remains <b>pure, as</b> it is presumed that in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered? But why</b> should that be the case? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>initially,</b> when it had fallen onto the <i>teruma</i>, <b>this needle was a proper,</b> non-rusty and unbroken, <b>needle,</b> capable of contracting and transmitting ritual impurity, <b>and it is</b> only <b>now that rust</b> had <b>formed</b> on it. The status of the <i>teruma</i> should at least be held in suspension. Rather, it is evident that the <i>teruma</i> is considered definitely pure and is not held in suspension due to the possibility that it might have become impure from the nail at a previous time or, presumably, in a previous place. |
| Teharot 3:6 | there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters? But didn’t we learn | Menachot 54b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is there one who says</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:6): In the case <b>of an egg-bulk</b> of a ritually impure <b>food that one placed in the sun and</b> that therefore <b>shrank</b> to less than an egg-bulk; <b>and similarly</b> in the case of <b>an olive-bulk</b> of flesh <b>of a corpse,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or a lentil-bulk of a creeping animal,</b> all of which impart impurity; <b>or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>piggul</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>notar</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden <b>fat,</b> if any of these were placed in the sun and shrank, they <b>are pure,</b> i.e., they do not impart impurity to other items, <b>and one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for them due to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> |
| Teharot 3:8 | As we learned | Chullin 86a:18 | The Gemara proves that Rabbi Meir is concerned for the minority: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): In the case of a ritually impure <b>child who is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough, and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure.</b> This is because there is no proof the child touched it; he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure <b>because it is the manner of a child to handle</b> items. <b>And we say</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>a majority of children handle</b> items, in this case the dough, that are within reach, <b>and a minority do not handle</b> items within reach, <b>and</b> the <b>dough</b> itself <b>retains a presumptive status of purity</b> since its impurity has not been definitively determined. |
| Teharot 3:8 | as we learned | Kiddushin 80a:6 | Rabbi Yoḥanan stated: <b>But one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status. As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: One burns</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One does not burn</b> <i>teruma</i> in this case. The Gemara comments: <b>And they follow their</b> standard lines of <b>reasoning</b> in this matter, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough, and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure <b>because it is the manner of a child to handle [<i>letappe’aḥ</i>]</b> items. |
| Teharot 3:8 | As we learned | Niddah 18b:9 | The Gemara cites the source for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion in this regard. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough</b> that has not yet risen, <b>and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure, <b>because it is the norm of a child to handle</b> items. |
| Teharot 4:2 | Rav Shimi raises an objection | Chullin 9b:5 | <b>Rav Shimi raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rava from a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:2): If the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> was <b>in the mouth of a weasel, and</b> that <b>weasel</b> was <b>walking on loaves of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the creeping animal <b>touched</b> the loaves and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it <b>did not touch</b> the loaves, <b>its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure, while</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>water</b> that is <b>exposed</b> and therefore susceptible to a snake leaving venom in it, the water is <b>forbidden.</b> |
| Teharot 4:4 | taught | Niddah 3b:4 | It is <b>taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:4) <b>in accordance with this version,</b> i.e., that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset: Hillel said to Shammai: Don’t you concede</b> to the following <i>halakha</i>: In the case <b>of a basket</b> that <b>was used</b> as a container for <b>ritually pure</b> items, and those items were placed <b>in</b> one <b>corner, and</b> subsequently the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in a different corner</b> of the basket, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> items <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> are now retroactively considered <b>impure? Shammai said to him: Indeed,</b> that is correct. |
| Teharot 4:5 | raise a contradiction | Niddah 33b:8 | <b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:5): <b>For six</b> cases of <b>uncertain</b> impurity <b>one burns the <i>teruma</i></b> if it came into contact with them, or if a person came into contact with them and subsequently touched the <i>teruma</i>. One of these is <b>for the uncertain</b> case <b>of the garments of one who is unreliable with regard to ritual impurity [<i>am ha’aretz</i>].</b> Such garments impart impurity through contact and through carrying, due to a concern that the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> might have sat on them while she was menstruating. Evidently, one burns <i>teruma</i> due to uncertain impurity. |
| Teharot 4:12 | mishna | Bava Metzia6b:2 | <b>When</b> on his way to Kafrei, Rabba <b>came to</b> the city of <b>Sura</b> and related the incident to the Sages there. <b>Rav Hamnuna said to him:</b> The resolution to your dilemma <b>is</b> found in the following <b>mishna</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 4:12): If there is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>firstborns, whether a human firstborn or an animal firstborn, whether</b> with regard to <b>kosher</b> animals <b>or non-kosher</b> animals, i.e., the firstborn of a donkey, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> The priest may not take the animal from its owner, or the redemption payment from the child’s father. <b>And it is taught in that regard</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One is nevertheless <b>prohibited from shearing and from working</b> such animals, as their status as firstborns is uncertain. |
| Teharot 5:7 | But didn’t we learn | Niddah 4a:7 | The Gemara asks a question with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And do we presume</b> that ritual impurity moved from place to place? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 5:7): If someone <b>touched one</b> other person <b>at night, and he does not know whether</b> the person he touched was <b>alive or dead, and on the following day he arose and found him dead,</b> and he is uncertain whether or not he contracted ritual impurity from contact with a corpse, <b>Rabbi Meir deems him</b> ritually <b>pure.</b> It is assumed that the deceased was still alive until the point that it is known with certainty that he was dead. |
| Teharot 6:5 | as we learned | Avodah Zarah70a:12 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:5): With regard to <b>one who enters into a valley during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, <b>and</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in such and such a field, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I know <b>I walked to that place,</b> i.e., I walked in the valley, <b>but I do not know whether I entered that field</b> where the ritual impurity was <b>or whether I did not</b> enter, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In a case of <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., it is uncertain whether he entered the area where the ritual impurity is located, he is <b>ritually pure.</b> But if he certainly entered the area where the ritual impurity is located and the <b>uncertainty</b> pertains to <b>contact</b> with the source of ritual impurity, he is <b>ritually impure.</b> Apparently, the ruling of Shmuel, that in a case where it is uncertain whether gentile thieves entered the house at all the wine is permitted, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. |
| Teharot 6:5 | As we learned | Bava Batra55b:2 | The Gemara further clarifies: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>ritual impurity</b> that is affected by determining whether an area is one or two fields? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:5): With regard to <b>one who enters into a valley during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, and therefore for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i> it is considered a private domain, and there is a principle that in a case of uncertainty concerning whether one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure; <b>and</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in such and such a field, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I know <b>I walked to that place,</b> i.e., I walked in the valley, <b>but I do not know whether I entered that place</b> where the ritual impurity was <b>or whether I did not</b> enter, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure and the Rabbis deem him impure.</b> |
| Teharot 6:7 | as we learned | Bava Batra153b:4 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says: And with regard to</b> a case of uncertain <b>ritual impurity,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends <b>on</b> the same <b>dispute.</b> This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:7): The <i>halakha</i> is that a case where it is uncertain if something or someone became impure in the public domain, the item or person is deemed pure. With regard to <b>an expanse of fields, in the summer,</b> when many people pass through the fields, it <b>is</b> considered <b>the private domain with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, but</b> it is considered <b>the public domain with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and if one is uncertain as to whether he was rendered impure there, he is deemed pure. |
| Teharot 7:1 | as well | Avodah Zarah70b:5 | <b>Abaye said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna <b>as well</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 7:1): In the case of <b>one who transferred keys to one who is unreliable with regard to ritual impurity [<i>am ha’aretz</i>],</b> even though contact with an <i>am ha’aretz</i> renders pure items impure, <b>his pure items are pure, because he transferred to</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> the responsibility for <b>safeguarding the key alone</b> and did not authorize him to enter. <b>Now</b> that the mishna has determined that <b>his pure items are pure, is it necessary</b> to state this principle with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation?</b> |
| Teharot 7:1 | concerning that which we learned | Ketubot 24b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> is the solution <b>of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva stated?</b> It is stated <b>concerning that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 7:1): In the case of <b>a potter who</b> fashioned his vessels in ritual purity, and <b>abandoned his pots, and descended to drink water from the river,</b> there is concern that in his absence ritually impure people came into contact with his pots. <b>The inner</b> pots <b>are pure, and the outer</b> pots <b>are impure.</b> |
| Teharot 7:6 | raises a contradiction | Chagigah 26a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 7:6): If <i>amei ha’aretz</i> tax <b>collectors entered a house, the entire house is impure.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>that</b> mishna is referring to a situation <b>where there is a gentile with them,</b> in which case they conduct a thorough search in the whole house, and certainly will have touched everything; whereas <b>this</b> mishna deals with a case <b>when there is no gentile with them,</b> and their claim not to have touched anything is therefore accepted. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 7:6): <b>If there is a gentile with</b> the tax collectors, <b>they are deemed credible</b> if they were <b>to say: We did not enter</b> the house at all; <b>but they are not deemed credible</b> if they were <b>to say: We entered</b> the house <b>but did not touch</b> its vessels. |
| Teharot 7:6 | raises a contradiction | Chagigah 26a:8 | § It is taught in the mishna: <b>And similarly thieves who returned vessels</b> are deemed credible. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 7:6): Concerning <b>the thieves who entered a house, only the place where the feet of the thieves had trodden is impure.</b> The implication is that all the vessels of the section of the house where they had entered are impure, and they are not deemed credible if they say that they did not touch a particular item. <b>Rav Pinḥas said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna here is referring to a case <b>where</b> the thieves <b>repented,</b> which is why they are deemed credible, whereas the mishna in <i>Teharot</i> is referring to a case in which the thieves did not repent. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> Thieves <b>who returned vessels,</b> which indicates that they repented and made restoration willingly. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case. |
| Teharot 8:6 | But didn’t we learn | Keritot 21a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is intent to feed a dog <b>not</b> considered intent to use the flesh as food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:6): The Sages <b>stated a principle with regard to ritual impurity:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> food <b>that is</b> assumed to be <b>food designated</b> for <b>a person,</b> once it becomes impure with the impurity of food, it remains <b>impure until it is rendered unfit to be consumed by a dog?</b> |
| Teharot 8:7 | as we learned | Niddah 7b:13 | <b>And the other</b> case in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:7): With regard to <b>the exterior of vessels that contracted ritual impurity</b> through contact <b>with</b> impure <b>liquids,</b> i.e., with liquids that had touched the carcass of a creeping animal, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says,</b> with regard to this impurity that applies by rabbinic law: These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids</b> that come in contact with them, but <b>they do not disqualify foods</b> with which they come into contact. The mishna elaborates: <b>They transmit impurity to</b> other <b>liquids, and even non-sacred</b> liquids. <b>And they do not disqualify foods, and even <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids and they disqualify</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>foods,</b> as well. |
| Teharot 8:8 | that which we learned | Zevachim 105b:10 | <b>Rabbi Zeira posed a dilemma to Rabbi Ami bar Ḥiyya, and some say to Rabbi Avin bar Kahana</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:8): <b>Connections between foods by liquid,</b> i.e., liquids in contact with two foods, a situation that causes the impurity of one food to be transmitted to the other and their sizes to be combined toward the minimum measure for transmitting impurity, are considered <b>a connection for</b> the <b>lenient impurity</b> of foods, <b>but</b> are <b>not</b> considered <b>a connection for impurity severe</b> enough to be transmitted to a human being. If two pieces of animal carcass are connected by a liquid, they do not combine to form the minimum measure for transmitting their impurity to a person, but they can transmit impurity to food. |
| Teharot 8:9 | elsewhere | Avodah Zarah72a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 8:9): <b>A stream</b> of water, <b>and</b> water descending <b>an incline [<i>vehakatafres</i>], and liquid</b> that rendered an item <b>moist</b> do <b>not</b> constitute <b>a connection</b> between liquids, <b>neither with regard to ritual impurity nor with regard to purity.</b> These liquids do not constitute a connection that transmits impurity, e.g., if impure water is in one place and becomes attached to water above it, the water above is not considered attached to the impure water and is not rendered impure. They also do not constitute a connection for purification, e.g., if two collections of water are attached via the pouring of a stream, they do not join together to form the amount of water necessary to form a valid ritual bath, through which people and items can become ritually pure. <b>A pond</b> constitutes <b>a connection</b> between liquids <b>with regard to impurity and with regard to purity.</b> |
| Teharot 8:9 | But didn’t we learn | Gittin 15b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And when there is liquid</b> that rendered one’s hand <b>moist, what of it?</b> Is this a relevant factor? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:9): |
| Teharot 9:1 | As we learned | Meilah 21a:9 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 9:1): <b>When do the olives</b> become <b>susceptible to</b> ritual <b>impurity? From when they exude</b> moisture. This is referring specifically to the <b>moisture</b> that emerges into <b>the vat, but not the moisture</b> that emerges into <b>the basket.</b> The moisture that comes into the vat softens the olives and is beneficial to the olive oil production, as it renders them easier to press. For this reason it is considered as though the homeowner has intent for the moisture to be there, and that moisture therefore renders the olives it touches susceptible to ritual impurity. By contrast, moisture in the basket serves no purpose, as it trickles out through holes in the basket. Consequently, it is not there with the intent of the homeowner and does not render the olives susceptible to ritual impurity. |
| Teharot 9:8 | different from that which we learned | Avodah Zarah75b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>the cluster and all its surroundings are impure but</b> the rest of <b>the entire winepress is pure,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 9:8): The carcass of <b>a creeping animal that was found in</b> an oil <b>press transmits impurity to the place it touched alone, but if there was liquid flowing</b> in the mill, <b>it is all</b> rendered <b>impure?</b> Why is it not the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the winepress as well that the entire winepress is impure due to the liquid in it? |
| Teharot 9:9 | And furthermore, we learned | Niddah 4a:12 | <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 9:9): If one <b>found</b> the carcass of <b>a burned creeping animal on top of</b> a pile of <b>olives,</b> and that animal no longer transmits impurity as it is burned, <b>and similarly</b> if one finds <b>a tattered rag</b> of a <i>zav</i>, which likewise no longer transmits impurity, on top of a pile of olives, the olives are <b>pure.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it is presumed in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Once again, this demonstrates that when this presumption is applied, the item is considered definitely pure, and is not held in suspension due to uncertainty. |
| Teharot 9:9 | raises an objection | Niddah 56a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna that indicates a burnt carcass of a creeping animal is pure (<i>Teharot</i> 9:9): In a case where <b>a burnt creeping animal was found on top of</b> a pile of <b>olives, and likewise,</b> if the <b>tattered rag</b> of a <i>zav</i> was found on a pile of olives, the olives and the rag <b>are pure.</b> One is not concerned that the carcass of the creeping animal touched the olives or rag before it was burned, because <b>with regard to all</b> matters of <b>impurity,</b> it is assumed that when the item in question came into contact with the potential sources of impurity, the potential sources of impurity were in the same state <b>as</b> they were at <b>the time they were found,</b> and a burnt carcass does not transmit impurity. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Reish Lakish refers <b>to</b> a case where <b>all of</b> the bones are intact, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a situation where only <b>part of</b> the bones are intact. |
