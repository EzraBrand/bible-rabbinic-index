| Tosefta 1:1 | another | Gittin 7b:5 | § The Gemara presents a contradiction between two <i>baraitot</i>. <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who brings a bill of divorce</b> that was written <b>on a boat</b> in Eretz Yisrael is considered to be <b>like one who brings</b> it <b>in Eretz Yisrael,</b> and therefore he is not required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1) that one who brings a bill of divorce written on a boat in Eretz Yisrael is <b>like one who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. |
| Tosefta 1:1 | The Sages taught | Keritot 7a:25 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): One who unwittingly <b>blasphemes brings an offering, since <i>karet</i> is stated with regard to it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15), as the Gemara will explain. The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> an established <b>principle</b> that <b>wherever it is written <i>karet</i> with regard to</b> a mitzva, one who violates it unwittingly <b>brings an offering? But there</b> is the case of the mitzva of the <b>Paschal offering, and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, as</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> is written</b> for failing to perform <b>them, and</b> yet <b>one does not bring an offering</b> for failing to perform these mitzvot unwittingly. |
| Tosefta 1:1 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 5b:10 | § After discussing the sources for the modes of acquisition listed in the mishna, the Gemara analyzes these <i>halakhot</i> in greater detail. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): <b>How</b> is betrothal performed <b>through money?</b> If a man <b>gave</b> a woman <b>money or</b> an item <b>worth money, and</b> he <b>said to her: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are to me as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed. But</b> if <b>she</b> is the one <b>who gave</b> the money to him, <b>and she said: I am hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby to you as a wife,</b> then <b>she is not betrothed.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:1 | as it is taught | Sotah 2b:18 | The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who presents a different version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1) that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: One who issues a warning to his wife issues a warning based on one witness or based on his own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> he <b>gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses who saw her secluded. The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>the Rabbis responded: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that one need not issue a warning in the presence of two witnesses, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as the Gemara will explain. |
| Tosefta 1:1 | The Sages taught | Sotah 3b:23 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): In the mishna quoted above, <b>which is the first testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of seclusion.</b> Which is <b>the final testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of defilement.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:2 | raises an objection | Sanhedrin 8b:1 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:2): <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> If he took her to court and <b>claimed money,</b> the case is to be adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. But if he took her to court and <b>claimed</b> that she was liable to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, the case must be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to Rava,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be read as referring to the terms of the beginning of the trial: If he <b>claimed money at the outset,</b> the case must be judged <b>by three</b> judges. Since the case concerns a financial claim, three are sufficient. But if he <b>initially claimed</b> she should be subject to the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>even</b> if the case becomes transformed into <b>a financial</b> case, it must be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges out of concern for their honor. <b>But</b> according <b>to Ulla,</b> who says the requirement for twenty-three judges is based on concern about rumors, it is <b>difficult.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:2 | raises a contradiction | Sotah 4a:9 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:2): The verse states: <b>“And she was</b> defiled <b>secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13), <b>and we have not heard what is the measure</b> of <b>seclusion. When it says</b> in that verse: <b>“And she was defiled</b> secretly,” <b>you must say</b> that the measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:4 | raises a contradiction | Chullin 13b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the formulation of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters,</b> and not: One may slaughter, that with regard to the slaughter of one who slaughters at night, <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is valid, but <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> one may <b>not</b> do so. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:4): <b>One may always slaughter, both during the day and at night, both on the rooftop and atop a ship,</b> indicating that slaughter at night is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. |
| Tosefta 1:4 | It is taught | Gittin 11a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:4): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said this to the Sages in</b> the city of <b>Tzaidan: Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis did not disagree with regard to all documents produced in gentile courts, that even though their signatories are gentiles,</b> these documents are <b>valid, even</b> in the case of <b>bills of divorce and</b> bills <b>of manumission. They disagreed only when they were prepared by a common person,</b> outside a court, <b>as Rabbi Akiva deems</b> a document of this kind <b>valid, and the Rabbis deem it invalid, except for bills of divorce and</b> bills <b>of manumission.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:5 | it is taught | Gittin 12b:13 | § With regard to the discussion in the mishna between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5) that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: We said to Meir: But isn’t it in the interest of a slave to leave his master to freedom? He said to us: It is to his detriment, as if he were the slave of a priest,</b> then by emancipating him the master thereby <b>disqualifies him from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>. We said to him: But what</b> would be <b>if</b> the master <b>wishes not to sustain him and not to provide him with a living?</b> He is <b>permitted</b> to do so. Therefore, the slave does not lose out when he is emancipated, as he was not guaranteed sustenance in any event. |
| Tosefta 1:5 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 22b:15 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): <b>How</b> does one acquire a slave <b>through possession?</b> If the slave <b>removes</b> the master’s <b>shoe,</b> or <b>carries his garments after him to the bathhouse,</b> or <b>undresses him,</b> or <b>bathes him,</b> or <b>anoints him,</b> or <b>scrubs</b> the oil off him, or <b>dresses him,</b> or <b>puts on his shoes, or lifts him,</b> the master <b>acquires him. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Acquisition through the mode of <b>possession should not be considered greater than</b> acquisition using the mode of <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b> With regard to this last statement the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying</b> here? The first <i>tanna</i> also said that a slave can be acquired by lifting. |
| Tosefta 1:5 | But isn’t it taught | Nazir 46b:1 | The Gemara raises a difficulty against Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: <b>And does</b> a lack of waving <b>preclude</b> the performance of the purification ritual of a nazirite? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): The inclusive phrase: <b>“This is the law of the nazirite,”</b> (Numbers 6:21) teaches that all nazirites are bound by the same <i>halakha</i>, <b>whether he has palms,</b> or <b>whether he does not have palms.</b> Since one who is lacking palms certainly cannot wave, this indicates that waving is not essential. |
| Tosefta 1:5 | that which is taught | Nazir 46b:2 | The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in a similar <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): <b>“This is the law of the nazirite” whether he has hair</b> or <b>whether he does not have hair; so too,</b> will you explain that lack of shaving does <b>not preclude</b> the ritual in the case of one who has no hair? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): With regard to an entirely <b>bald nazirite,</b> who cannot shave his hair with a razor as required, <b>Beit Shammai say: He need not pass a razor over his head, and Beit Hillel say: He must pass a razor over his head.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:5 | But isn’t it taught | Nazir 46b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t</b> the lack of waving <b>preclude</b> a nazirite’s ritual? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): The inclusive phrase: <b>“This is the law of the nazirite,”</b> teaches that <b>whether he has palms</b> or <b>whether he does not have palms</b> waving is always required, and a nazirite is not exempted by a lack of palms. The Gemara questions this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in the same <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): <b>“This is the law of the nazirite,” whether he has hair or whether he does not have hair; so too,</b> will you say <b>that</b> the lack of shaving <b>precludes</b> his ritual? |
| Tosefta 1:6 | Rav | Gittin 14a:15 | The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): If one said to another: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so, as I owe him</b> that sum, or if he said: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, as I owe him</b> that sum, or if he said: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so,</b> as they are <b>a deposit he has in my possession,</b> or: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so,</b> as they are <b>a deposit he has in my possession,</b> in all these cases the sender <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for their</b> loss, <b>but if he seeks to retract he cannot retract.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:6 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 28b:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): <b>How does the authority of the Temple</b> treasury effect acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>money?</b> With regard to the Temple <b>treasurer who gives coins for an animal, even</b> if the <b>animal is at the</b> other <b>end of the world, he acquires it</b> immediately. <b>And with regard to a commoner, he does not acquire</b> the animal <b>until he pulls</b> it. |
| Tosefta 1:6 | But isn’t it taught | Nazir 46b:2 | The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in a similar <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): <b>“This is the law of the nazirite” whether he has hair</b> or <b>whether he does not have hair; so too,</b> will you explain that lack of shaving does <b>not preclude</b> the ritual in the case of one who has no hair? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): With regard to an entirely <b>bald nazirite,</b> who cannot shave his hair with a razor as required, <b>Beit Shammai say: He need not pass a razor over his head, and Beit Hillel say: He must pass a razor over his head.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:6 | But isn’t it taught | Nazir 46b:8 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): With regard to an entirely <b>bald nazirite, Beit Shammai say: He need not pass a razor over his head, and Beit Hillel say: He must</b> pass a razor over his head. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that even according to the opinion of Beit Hillel a nazirite does not have to actually shave. <b>Rabbi Avina said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>He must,</b> as stated <b>by Beit Hillel?</b> It means that <b>he must</b> shave, and if he fails to do so <b>he has no remedy,</b> and can never drink wine. |
| Tosefta 1:7 | of Rava | Bava Kamma20a:16 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:7): <b>If</b> the animal <b>derived benefit</b> from eating another’s produce, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derived. How so?</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> one <b><i>kav</i> or two <i>kav</i></b> of grain, <b>we do not say</b> that <b>he should pay their value. Rather,</b> the court <b>estimates how much a person would pay in order to feed his animal</b> typical food <b>fit for it</b> to eat, <b>even if</b> this particular animal <b>does not usually</b> eat that food, as its owner gives it cheaper food. Therefore, if the animal ate barley, which is typical animal fare, even though it does not usually do so, its owner must pay compensation for the barley that was eaten, at its cheapest market price. <b>Therefore,</b> if the animal <b>ate wheat or</b> another <b>item that is detrimental to</b> it, so that it did not derive any benefit, if this occurred in the public domain the owner is <b>exempt</b> from all liability. |
| Tosefta 1:7 | supports his | Bava Kamma20a:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:7): If a person was standing in the public domain, and <b>his basket</b> containing food <b>was slung behind his back, and</b> an animal <b>stretched out its neck and ate from it,</b> its owner is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this: This <i>baraita</i> does not support Ilfa’s opinion, because one could explain that the case in that <i>baraita</i> is <b>as Rava says</b> in a different situation: The ruling is stated <b>with regard to a jumping</b> animal; <b>here also</b> it can be suggested that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a jumping</b> animal, and since the animal engaged in atypical behavior it is classified as a case of Goring as opposed to a case of Eating. For damage classified as Goring, the owner of the animal is liable for his animal’s actions in the public domain, although he pays only half the cost of the damage. |
| Tosefta 1:8 | The Sages taught | Bava Metzia7a:15 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:8): In a case where <b>two</b> people, a creditor and a debtor, <b>are grasping</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> and the <b>creditor says:</b> The promissory note <b>is mine,</b> as the debt has not yet been repaid, <b>and I</b> merely <b>dropped it and I</b> subsequently <b>found it, and</b> the <b>debtor says:</b> The promissory note <b>was</b> once <b>yours,</b> i.e., you lent me the money, <b>but I</b> already <b>repaid you,</b> and you therefore gave me the note, in that case <b>the</b> promissory <b>note must be ratified through its signatories</b> for the creditor to collect the debt. In other words, the court must first ascertain the validity of the promissory note by verifying that the signatures of the witnesses are authentic. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Tosefta 1:8 | would be visible upon the water. The Sages taught | Sotah 16b:5 | § The mishna states: He would take loose dust from underneath the tablet and place it into the vessel with the water, <b>so that</b> the dust <b>would be visible upon the water. The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:8): <b>Three</b> items <b>are required to be seen: The dust of the <i>sota</i></b> must be visible in the water, <b>the ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> must be visible when placed in the waters of purification, <b>and the spittle of a woman whose husband, who has a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i>]</b> must be visible. The <i>yavam</i>, brother-in-law of the <i>yevama</i>, is bound by Torah law to marry her, and this bond is dissolved through the ritual of <i>ḥalitza</i>, in which she spits before him in the presence of judges. <b>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael they said: Even the blood of the bird</b> used in a leper’s purification ritual is required to be visible in the vessel. |
| Tosefta 1:10 | The Sages taught | Keritot 8a:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10): If a woman has the obligations of <b>five definite births and five uncertain discharges of a <i>zava</i>, or five definite births and five uncertain births, she brings two nests, one for the definite</b> obligation <b>and one for the uncertain</b> obligation. That which she brought <b>for</b> the <b>definite</b> obligation is <b>eaten</b> by the priests, <b>and the remaining</b> offerings <b>are an obligation for her.</b> That which she brought <b>for</b> the <b>uncertain</b> obligation is <b>not eaten, and the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b> |
| Tosefta 1:10 | It is taught | Sotah 15a:9 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: By right,</b> it should have been the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the meal-offering of a sinner requires oil and frankincense, so that a sinner should not</b> stand to <b>gain</b> by not having to pay for them. <b>For what</b> reason <b>does</b> the verse <b>not require</b> them? It is <b>so that his offering will not be</b> of <b>superior</b> quality. |
| Tosefta 1:10 | stated | Temurah 6b:10 | § The Gemara returns to the topic of blemished animals. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “But whatever has a blemish, you shall not offer;</b> for it shall not be acceptable for you” (Leviticus 22:20)? <b>If</b> it serves to teach that <b>you may not slaughter</b> a blemished animal as a sacrifice even if it has been consecrated, <b>that is</b> already <b>stated below,</b> later on in the passage, as the Gemara will soon explain. <b>Rather, why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that <b>you may not offer</b> a blemished animal? This serves to teach that <b>you may not consecrate</b> it. <b>From here,</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10): <b>One who consecrates blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar violates five</b> separate <b>categories</b> of prohibition. |
| Tosefta 1:28 | learned this, as the Sages taught | Meilah 15b:3 | § The mishna teaches that the flesh and the fat join together. The Gemara notes that <b>we</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:28): The meat of <b>burnt offerings and</b> their <b>sacrificial portions join together to</b> constitute the amount of <b>an olive-bulk</b> that renders one liable <b>for sacrificing them outside</b> the courtyard, <b>and to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and</b> partaking of them while <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:1 | raises a contradiction | Avodah Zarah22b:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the assumption that gentiles are suspected of bestiality, the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): <b>One may purchase an animal from</b> gentiles <b>for</b> use as <b>an offering, and there is no concern</b> that it might be unfit <b>due to</b> it being <b>an animal that copulated with a person, or due to</b> is being <b>an animal that was the object of bestiality, or due to</b> it having been <b>set aside</b> for idol worship, <b>or due to</b> the animal itself having been <b>worshipped.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:1 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma17b:10 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): If <b>chickens were flying from place to place and broke vessels with their wings,</b> their owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> as this is a subcategory of Trampling. By contrast, if the damage was caused <b>by the wind</b> generated <b>by their wings,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> in the case of pebbles. <b>Sumakhos says:</b> The owner pays <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>chickens were hopping upon dough or upon produce and they sullied</b> it with their feet, <b>or</b> if <b>they pecked</b> at it and caused damage, their owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. If</b> in the course of their hopping <b>they stirred up dust or</b> propelled <b>pebbles,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. Sumakhos says:</b> He pays <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:1 | This is also taught | Sanhedrin 10b:3 | <b>Abaye said:</b> Emend the text of the mishna and <b>teach: The sanctification of the</b> new <b>month</b> is performed by three judges. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): <b>The sanctification of the</b> new <b>month and the intercalation of the year</b> is performed <b>by three</b> judges; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rava said</b> in objection to Abaye’s explanation: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Intercalation,</b> not sanctification. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> Explain the mishna this way: If there will be <b>sanctification</b> of the new month <b>on the</b> thirtieth day of the first month, which is the <b>day</b> that would otherwise be the <b>intercalation,</b> this is done <b>by three</b> judges. But <b>after</b> the day of the <b>intercalation,</b> i.e., if the month is sanctified on the thirty-first day, <b>there is no</b> active <b>sanctification</b> necessary. |
| Tosefta 2:1 | It is taught | Sanhedrin 10b:8 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that intercalation is performed in stages: The deliberations begin <b>with three</b> judges, they debate the matter with five judges, and they conclude the matter with seven judges. The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): <b>How does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel say</b> the intercalation is to be conducted? The court <b>begins</b> the deliberation <b>with three</b> judges, <b>and</b> they <b>debate</b> the matter <b>with five, and</b> they <b>conclude with seven.</b> At first, three judges convene for a preliminary discussion with regard to the necessity of adding a month to the year. If <b>one says</b> it is necessary <b>to sit</b> and deliberate the question of intercalation <b>and two say that</b> there is <b>not</b> a need <b>to sit</b> and continue, <b>the single</b> opinion in favor of intercalation <b>is negated in its minority,</b> i.e., it is the minority opinion, and the process ends. |
| Tosefta 2:1 | The Sages taught | Sotah 32b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): The priest <b>informs</b> the <i>sota</i> <b>in any language that she can hear</b> and understand <b>for what</b> reason <b>she must drink</b> the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>, <b>and from what</b> vessel <b>she will drink, on account of what</b> actions <b>she is</b> considered to be <b>defiled and in what</b> way <b>she defiled herself.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:2 | Ulla | Gittin 16b:12 | <b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla</b> from the following <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the bill of divorce <b>valid in this</b> case <b>but not in another</b> case. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this serves <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>one says: It was written in my presence, and one says: It was signed in my presence?</b> |
| Tosefta 2:2 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 11b:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): The court <b>may intercalate the year for three matters: For the ripening of the grain,</b> if it is not yet time for the barley to ripen; <b>for the fruit of the trees,</b> if they have not yet ripened; <b>and for the equinox,</b> i.e., to ensure that the autumnal equinox will precede <i>Sukkot</i>. If <b>two of</b> these concerns apply, the court <b>intercalates</b> the year even if the third factor does not apply; <b>but for</b> only <b>one of them</b> the court <b>does not intercalate</b> the year. |
| Tosefta 2:2 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 11b:7 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): The court <b>may intercalate the year for three</b> regional <b>lands</b> of Eretz Yisrael, meaning that the court considers the agricultural situation in three regions: <b>Judea, and Transjordan, and the Galilee.</b> If there is a concern <b>about two of them,</b> the court <b>intercalates</b> the year even if the third region does not need it, <b>but</b> if there is a concern <b>about</b> only <b>one of them</b> the court <b>does not intercalate</b> the year. <b>And when Judea is one of them, everyone is happy, because the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>comes only from Judea.</b> If the court therefore ensures that the crops in Judea ripen just before the <i>omer</i> is brought, the crops will certainly be ripe in the other regions as well, and there will be no complications with the prohibition of the new crop. |
| Tosefta 2:2 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 11b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): The court <b>may intercalate the years only</b> when located <b>in Judea. And if they intercalated it</b> when located <b>in the Galilee,</b> the year is nevertheless <b>intercalated. Ḥananya of Ono testified:</b> Even <b>if</b> the court already formally <b>intercalated</b> the year when located <b>in the Galilee, it is not intercalated. Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, says: What is the reasoning of Ḥananya of Ono? The verse states:</b> “But to the place that the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, <b>to His abode shall you seek, and there you shall come”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5). This is interpreted as: <b>Every pursuit that you shall pursue</b> in the area of <i>halakha</i> <b>must be only in the abode of the Omnipresent,</b> in close proximity to Jerusalem, i.e., in Judea. |
| Tosefta 2:2 | it is taught | Sotah 18b:12 | § The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that “amen, amen” means: <b>Amen that I did not become defiled</b> in the past, amen that I will not become defiled in the future. With regard to this <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): <b>When Rabbi Meir said: Amen that I will not become defiled</b> in the future, he did <b>not</b> mean to say <b>that if</b> God knows that <b>she will become defiled</b> in the future, the <b>water</b> that she drinks now <b>evaluates</b> whether <b>she</b> will be unfaithful and passes judgment on her <b>from now. Rather,</b> he meant <b>that</b> in the event <b>that she becomes defiled</b> in the future, the <b>water</b> that she drinks now will <b>destabilize her and evaluate</b> then whether <b>she</b> was unfaithful. |
| Tosefta 2:3 | hear | Bava Kamma24a:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3): <b>An ox does not become forewarned until</b> witnesses <b>testify against it in the presence of</b> its <b>owner and in the presence of a court.</b> If <b>they testified against it in the presence of a court but not in the presence of</b> its <b>owner,</b> or <b>in the presence of</b> its <b>owner but not in the presence of a court, it does not become forewarned until they testify against it in the presence of a court and in the presence of</b> its <b>owner.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:3 | one | Kiddushin 48b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to one who says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this cup,</b> without further specification, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>and</b> also <b>with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>but not with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with its contents but not with it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult:</b> The <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another since <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>water, this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>wine,</b> and <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>oil.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:3 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 12a:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3): The court <b>may not intercalate the year before Rosh HaShana. And if</b> the court <b>intercalated it</b> this early, <b>it is not intercalated. But</b> if there was a need to intercalate it early <b>due to exigent</b> circumstances, e.g., religious persecution, they <b>may intercalate it immediately after Rosh HaShana.

| Tosefta 2:3 | forced to drink against her will? But isn’t it taught | Sotah 19b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Akiva</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that the woman is <b>forced to drink against her will? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A hook [<i>kelabus</i>]</b> made <b>of iron is</b> forcibly <b>placed into her mouth,</b> so <b>that if the scroll was erased and she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will. Rabbi Akiva said:</b> It is not necessary to force her to drink. <b>Don’t we need</b> to force her to drink the water <b>only</b> in order <b>to evaluate her</b> fidelity? <b>And isn’t she established as</b> having been <b>evaluated</b> when she refuses to drink, as she is essentially admitting her guilt? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>Until the handful is sacrificed she can retract</b> her decision to drink the bitter water; however, <b>once the handful is sacrificed she cannot retract</b> her decision to drink. |
| Tosefta 2:4 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 12a:9 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:4): The court <b>may not intercalate the year from one year to another, and</b> it does <b>not</b> intercalate <b>three</b> successive <b>years, one</b> directly <b>after the other. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva</b> at the time <b>when he was incarcerated in prison, and</b> he <b>intercalated three years, one after the other.</b> The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: Is there any <b>proof from there?</b> Rabbi Akiva merely made the calculations, but a special <b>court sat and established each one at its time.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:5 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 11b:10 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:5): The court <b>does not intercalate the year</b> |
| Tosefta 2:5 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 12a:10 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:5): The court <b>may not intercalate the year in the Sabbatical</b> Year, so as not to prolong the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year, <b>nor in the year after the Sabbatical</b> Year, when there is not much produce available, and delaying the consumption of the new crop would also cause hardship. <b>When</b> is the court <b>accustomed to intercalate?</b> On the <b>eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, which causes no particular challenges. Nevertheless, the courts <b>of the house of Rabban Gamliel would intercalate</b> the year <b>in the year after the Sabbatical</b> Year. |
| Tosefta 2:6 | Abaye raises an objection | Bava Batra45b:2 | <b>Abaye raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): There is a case where one <b>saw his slave in</b> the <b>possession of a craftsman, or his cloak in</b> the <b>possession of a launderer,</b> and <b>says to him: What</b> is the <b>nature of its</b> presence <b>in your</b> possession? If the craftsman or launderer replied: <b>You sold me</b> the slave or cloak, or: <b>You gave</b> the slave or cloak <b>to me as a gift,</b> he has <b>not said anything,</b> and must return it, since a craftsman does not establish the presumption of ownership. But if the craftsman or launderer replied: <b>You said in my presence to</b> someone else <b>to sell</b> the slave or cloak to him <b>or to give</b> the slave or cloak <b>to him,</b> i.e., to sell or give the slave or cloak to the craftsman or launderer himself, <b>as a gift,</b> then <b>his statement is valid.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma30a:11 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): With regard to <b>one who conceals his thorns or his pieces of glass in another’s wall, and the owner of the wall came and demolished his wall and it fell into the public domain,</b> and the thorns or glass <b>caused damage, the one who concealed them is liable.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | of Abaye | Gittin 23b:15 | The Gemara notes that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: A woman is deemed credible to bring her</b> own <b>bill of divorce through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as women</b> about <b>whom the Sages said:</b> They <b>are not deemed credible to say: Her husband died, are</b> nevertheless <b>deemed credible to bring her bill of divorce,</b> with regard to the woman herself, <b>who is deemed credible to say</b> that <b>her husband died, is it not right that she is deemed credible to bring her</b> own <b>bill of divorce?</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | This is also taught | Kiddushin 49a:5 | § <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon is only where he misled her <b>with enhanced monetary</b> value, i.e., he gave her something worth more than the item he had stipulated. <b>But</b> where he misled her <b>with enhanced lineage,</b> so that she was under the impression that his genealogy was less impressive than it in fact is, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>she is not betrothed. What is the reason</b> for this? A woman says: <b>I do not desire a shoe that is larger than my foot.</b> She does not wish to marry a man whose social standing is far greater than her own. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that <b>if he misled her with enhanced lineage, she is not betrothed.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | Rabbi Neḥemya, as it is taught | Meilah 19b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> According to the mishna, one can be liable for misuse after misuse only in the case of an animal or service vessels. The Gemara inquires: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): One is liable for <b>misuse after misuse only in</b> the case of <b>an animal alone.</b> Since an animal designated for sacrifice is not awaiting redemption or sale, its sanctity is not compromised when someone misuses it. It is therefore susceptible to repeated misuse. But with regard to service vessels, as according to the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> they may be redeemed, their sanctity is compromised after they are misused even once, and they are no longer subject to misuse. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> One is liable for misuse both in the case of <b>an animal and</b> in the case of <b>service vessels.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | As it is taught | Sanhedrin 11b:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who was sitting on a step on the Temple Mount, and Yoḥanan, that scribe, was standing before him, and three</b> blank <b>documents cut</b> from parchment and ready for writing <b>were set before him.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:6 | The Sages taught | Sotah 23a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): <b>All</b> the women <b>who are married into the priesthood, their meal-offerings are burned. How so?</b> With regard to <b>the daughter of a priest,</b> or <b>the daughter of a Levite or an Israelite woman who is married to a priest, her meal-offering is not eaten due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> her father or husband, respectively, <b>has a share in</b> the meal-offering, and it is therefore treated as the meal-offering of a priest, which is not eaten. <b>But it is not completely burned</b> without removing a handful from it, as the Torah states with regard to the meal-offering of a priest, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that she</b> also <b>has a share in it. Rather, the handful is sacrificed by itself, and the remainder</b> of the meal-offering <b>is sacrificed by itself.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:7 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 11b:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:7): The court <b>may intercalate the year only during the day; and if</b> the court <b>intercalated it at night, it is not intercalated. And</b> the court <b>may sanctify the month only during the day; and if</b> the court <b>sanctified it at night, it is not sanctified. Rav Abba says: What is the verse</b> from which this <i>halakha</i> is derived? <b>“Sound the shofar at the New Moon, at the concealed time for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). On <b>which Festival is the new moon concealed? You must say it is Rosh HaShana,</b> which occurs on the first of the month, before the moon is visible, whereas the moon is visible during the other Festivals, which occur later in the month. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5). <b>Just as</b> all civil <b>judgment is</b> done <b>during the day, so too is</b> the sanctification of Rosh HaShana, and <b>the sanctification of the month</b> in general, done <b>during the day.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:7 | And furthermore, it is taught | Sanhedrin 13a:4 | <b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:7): The court <b>intercalates the year only if the season</b> of Tammuz <b>was lacking</b> its completion for <b>most of the month</b> of Tishrei. <b>And how much</b> is: <b>Most of the month? Sixteen days. Rabbi Yehuda says: Two parts,</b> meaning two-thirds, <b>of the month. And how much is: Two parts of the month? Twenty days,</b> since in that case the day of the equinox would fall on the twenty-first, and since according to Rabbi Yehuda the day of the equinox concludes the season, the new season would begin on the following day, after the Festival of the Ingathering has ended. |
| Tosefta 2:8 | raise a contradiction | Bava Batra42a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> with regard to <b>a buyer,</b> the transaction generates <b>publicity? And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:8): If one worked and <b>profited</b> from the land <b>in the presence of the father,</b> the prior owner, for one <b>year, and in the presence of the son,</b> who then inherited it from the father, for <b>two</b> years; or <b>in the presence of the father</b> for <b>two</b> years <b>and in the presence of the son</b> for one <b>year;</b> or <b>in the presence of the father</b> for one <b>year and in the presence of the son</b> for one <b>year and in the presence of the buyer,</b> who purchased it from the son, for one <b>year; this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that with regard to <b>a buyer,</b> the transaction generates <b>publicity, there is no greater protest than this.</b> By selling his land to someone else, the son of the prior owner is clearly stating that it does not belong to the possessor. |
| Tosefta 2:8 | But | Sanhedrin 18b:8 | <b>Rather,</b> the meaning of Rav Yosef’s statement is that <b>he testifies before the king,</b> and it is not in keeping with the dignity of the High Priest to testify if the king is a presiding judge. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> didn’t we learn in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:8) that <b>a king is not seated on the Sanhedrin?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Yosef is referring to a special arrangement: <b>Due to the honor of</b> the <b>High Priest,</b> the king <b>comes and sits</b> as one of the judges, <b>they receive his testimony, he rises and goes, and we deliberate about the case.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:9 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 8b:4 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and <b>she took it</b> from his hand <b>and threw it into the sea, or into the fire, or into anything that destroys, she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that she is not betrothed only if the one hundred dinars are destroyed, <b>but</b> if she <b>threw the coins before him</b> but did not destroy them, <b>that is a betrothal.</b> Why should this be? By throwing the coins at him <b>she is</b> effectively <b>saying to him: Take</b> this; <b>I do not want</b> your betrothal. |
| Tosefta 2:9 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 8b:6 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father, she is not betrothed.</b> If she said: Give the money to my father, or Give the money to your father <b>on the condition that he accepts them for me, she is betrothed.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:9 | As it is taught | Nazir 34a:2 | <b>Rather,</b> the mishna represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as</b> stated with regard to <b>a heap</b> of grain. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If someone said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that this heap</b> of grain <b>contains one hundred <i>kor</i>,</b> a measurement of volume, <b>and</b> when <b>he went</b> to measure it <b>he discovered that</b> the heap <b>was stolen or lost,</b> so that the amount it held cannot be determined, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>prohibited</b> in all the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship, as the heap might have contained one hundred <i>kor</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda deems him permitted,</b> as he maintains that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in cases of uncertain naziriteship. Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning applies equally to the case of the mishna. |
| Tosefta 2:10 | raises an objection | Kiddushin 8a:14 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:10). If a man says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and</b> while <b>he was counting</b> the money, <b>one of them wanted to retract</b> the betrothal, <b>it is in the power</b> of either of them to do so <b>even when</b> only <b>the last</b> dinar remains to be given. This indicates that the betrothal does not take effect until the entire one hundred dinars has been paid. |
| Tosefta 2:10 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 12a:12 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:10): The court <b>may not intercalate the year due to ritual impurity,</b> i.e., in the event that most of the Jewish people are in a state of impurity, to give them enough time to become ritually pure before Passover. |
| Tosefta 2:12 | It is taught | Nedarim 65a:1 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:12): With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another, they dissolve</b> the vow <b>for him only in the presence</b> of the one who is the subject of the vow. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman said: As it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). Rav Naḥman notes that the verse specifies where God spoke to Moses, and explains that God <b>said to him: In Midian you vowed</b> to Yitro that you would not return to Egypt, <b>go and dissolve your vow in Midian.</b> And where does it say that Moses vowed to Yitro? <b>For it is written: “And Moses was content [<i>vayo’el</i>]</b> to dwell with the man” (Exodus 2:21). The word <i>vayo’el</i> is related to the word <i>ala</i>, and <b><i>ala</i> means nothing other than an oath, as it is written: “And he…brought him under an oath [<i>ala</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13), and the <i>halakhot</i> of dissolution of oaths are identical to those of dissolution of vows. |
| Tosefta 2:14 | raised an objection to | Nazir 16b:7 | Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:14): <b>One who was impure and took a vow of naziriteship</b> must still observe the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite: He is <b>prohibited from shaving, and from drinking wine, and from becoming impure from a corpse. And if he shaved, or</b> if he <b>drank wine, or</b> if <b>he became impure from a corpse, he incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] the forty</b> lashes administered to one who actively transgresses a negative Torah prohibition. Rabbi Yoḥanan asks: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that naziriteship <b>takes effect</b> despite his ritual impurity, <b>that is the reason that he incurs the forty</b> lashes, similar to any nazirite who transgresses the prohibitions of naziriteship. <b>But if you say</b> the naziriteship <b>does not take effect</b> while he is ritually impure, <b>why does he incur the forty</b> lashes? |
| Tosefta 2:14 | hear | Nazir 17a:8 | The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:14): <b>One who was ritually impure and took a vow of naziriteship</b> must still observe the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite. He is <b>prohibited from shaving and from drinking wine. And if he shaved, or</b> if <b>he drank wine, or</b> if <b>he became ritually impure from a corpse, he incurs the forty</b> lashes administered to one who actively transgresses a negative Torah prohibition. The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Reish Lakish, as explained by Mar bar Rav Ashi. |
| Tosefta 2:30 | The Sages taught | Bava Metzia33a:12 | § The mishna teaches: If <b>his father and his teacher were</b> each <b>carrying a burden,</b> he first places his teacher’s burden down and thereafter places his father’s burden down. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:30): <b>His teacher,</b> with regard to <b>whom</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>stated</b> in the mishna that his burden takes precedence, is <b>his teacher who taught him wisdom,</b> i.e., the profound analysis of the Torah that constitutes the Talmud, <b>and not his teacher who taught him Bible or Mishna;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The reference is to <b>any</b> teacher <b>from whom</b> one learned <b>most of his knowledge,</b> be it Bible, Mishna, or Talmud. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if he enlightened him in</b> the understanding of <b>only one mishna, that is his teacher.</b> |
| Tosefta 2:31 | raises a contradiction | Bava Metzia29b:17 | § The Gemara resumes its analysis of the mishna, which teaches with regard to borrowed scrolls: <b>But he shall not study</b> passages <b>in them for the first time and another</b> person <b>shall not read</b> the scroll <b>with him.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:31): If one borrows a scroll, <b>he shall not read a passage and review it, and he shall not read a passage in it and translate</b> the passage, <b>and he shall not open it more than three columns</b> at a time, <b>and three people shall not read in it</b> together <b>from one volume.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But two people may read</b> it together, contrary to the ruling in the mishna. |
| Tosefta 3:1 | raises an objection | Arakhin 19a:11 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my height, gives</b> a thick <b>rod that cannot be bent</b> equivalent to his height. One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my full height,</b> may <b>give</b> even a thin <b>rod that</b> can be <b>bent,</b> provided it is equivalent to his height. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my height,</b> or: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my full height, he gives</b> a thick <b>rod that cannot be bent</b> and that is equivalent to his height. |
| Tosefta 3:1 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra65b:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): One <b>who sells a house has sold the door and the door bolt and the lock, but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the key. He has sold the mortar that was hollowed out</b> of the ground <b>but not</b> the mortar <b>that was fixed</b> to the ground after its construction. <b>He has sold the</b> immovable <b>lower millstone but not the</b> portable <b>upper stone.</b> And he has sold <b>neither the oven, nor the double stove, nor the hand mill. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The principle is that <b>any</b> item <b>attached to the ground is</b> considered <b>like the ground</b> and included in the sale. |
| Tosefta 3:1 | The Sages taught | Gittin 30a:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): With regard to <b>one who lends money to a priest, or to a Levite, or to a poor person</b> with the understanding that <b>he will separate their portion</b> of the <i>teruma</i> and tithes from his produce <b>on the basis of that</b> money, <b>he may separate</b> the <i>teruma</i> and tithes from his produce <b>on the basis of that</b> money, <b>with the presumption that they are</b> still <b>alive.</b> |
| Tosefta 3:1 | is taught | Gittin 30a:19 | § It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to <b>one who lends money to a priest or to a Levite in court and they died</b> before repaying the loan, <b>he separates</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>on the basis of that</b> money <b>with the presumption</b> that there is one from <b>that tribe</b> who inherited from them, and he need not confirm that the deceased priest or Levite has immediate heirs. He then continues the arrangement based on the transfer of the debt to the heirs. <b>And</b> if he lent money <b>to a poor person in court, and</b> the poor person <b>died</b> before repaying the loan, the creditor <b>separates</b> tithes <b>on the basis of that</b> money <b>with the presumption</b> that <b>the poor of the Jewish people</b> would agree to continue the arrangement. <b>Rabbi Aḥai says:</b> It is <b>with the presumption</b> that <b>the poor of the world</b> would agree to continue the arrangement. |
| Tosefta 3:1 | is taught | Gittin 30b:4 | § The mishna teaches that if the priest or Levite <b>died,</b> the lender <b>needs to obtain permission</b> from the heirs to continue the arrangement. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that this is referring to <b>heirs who inherited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And are there heirs who do not inherit?</b> What is meant by the expression: Heirs who inherit? <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This means heirs <b>who inherited land,</b> as one can collect debts from land bequeathed by a borrower, <b>and not</b> heirs <b>who inherited money,</b> as lenders cannot collect debts from money bequeathed by a borrower. |
| Tosefta 3:1 | of Reish Lakish | Sanhedrin 15b:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Merits,</b> according to Reish Lakish? It means that <b>he merits according to Heaven,</b> meaning that he has performed a mitzva by destroying a harmful animal. The Gemara relates: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): <b>Both an ox that killed and</b> a different <b>domesticated animal or undomesticated animal that killed</b> are sentenced <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: An ox that killed</b> is sentenced <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>other domesticated animals and undomesticated animals that killed, anyone who kills them first merits, with that</b> act, <b>according to Heaven.</b> It is therefore apparent that the disagreement concerns only animals that have killed, and that, as Reish Lakish explained, the term: Merits, indicates only a moral achievement but not a financial acquisition. |
| Tosefta 3:2 | The Sages taught | Arakhin 19b:2 | § The mishna teaches that there is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei concerning one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my forearm,</b> as to how he ascertains the weight of his forearm. <b>The Sages taught</b> this dispute in greater detail in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:2): With regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my forearm, and</b> with regard to one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>weight of my leg, Rabbi Yehuda says: He brings a barrel and fills</b> it with <b>water, and</b> he <b>inserts</b> his <b>forearm up to the elbow or</b> his <b>leg up to the knee,</b> into the water. |
| Tosefta 3:2 | The Sages taught | Gittin 30b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>an Israelite who said to a Levite: There is tithe of yours in my possession</b> that I separated from my produce on your behalf, <b>one is not concerned about</b> the <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe that is in it,</b> i.e., the one-tenth of the tithe that is given to the priest and forbidden to both the Levite and the Israelite; rather it is assumed to be only first tithe. However, if he said to him: <b>There is a <i>kor</i> of tithe of yours in my possession,</b> then <b>one is concerned about</b> the <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe that is in it.</b> |
| Tosefta 3:3 | The Sages taught | Arakhin 20a:22 | The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my valuation, gives</b> half of his valuation. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:3): One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>half of my valuation, gives half of his valuation.

| Tosefta 3:4 | is taught | Gittin 46a:4 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:4) <b>in accordance with the first version: Rabbi Meir said: For what</b> reason <b>did they say</b> that a man <b>who divorces his wife due to</b> her <b>bad reputation may not remarry</b> her, <b>and</b> one who divorces his wife due to <b>a vow may not remarry</b> her? <b>Perhaps she will go and marry another</b> man, <b>and</b> later <b>the matter will be found</b> to have been <b>fabricated,</b> i.e., he will find that the rumor was false or that it was possible to dissolve the vow, <b>and he will say: If I would have known that it is like this,</b> then <b>even if they would have given me one hundred</b> times <b>one hundred dinars</b> to divorce her <b>I would not have divorced her; and</b> the <b>bill of divorce</b> will be <b>found</b> to be <b>void, and her children</b> from her second husband will be considered <b><i>mamzerim</i>. Therefore, one says to him</b> from the outset: <b>Be aware that</b> a man <b>who divorces his wife due to</b> her <b>bad reputation may not remarry</b> her, <b>and</b> one who divorces his wife <b>due to a vow may not remarry</b> her. |
| Tosefta 3:4 | is taught | Gittin 46a:5 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:4) <b>in accordance with the latter version: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: For what</b> reason <b>did they say that</b> a man <b>who divorces his wife due to</b> her <b>bad reputation may not remarry</b> her, <b>and</b> one who divorces his wife due to <b>a vow may not remarry</b> her? So that <b>Jewish women will not be licentious with regard to forbidden</b> sexual <b>relations or</b> lax <b>with regard to vows. Therefore,</b> in order to publicize this matter, <b>one says to him</b> upon divorcing his wife: <b>Say to her: Be aware that I am removing you</b> from the house <b>due to</b> your <b>bad reputation, or: I am removing you</b> from the house <b>due to a vow.</b> |
| Tosefta 3:4 | these tanna’im . As it is taught | Kiddushin 48b:4 | <b>And</b> they disagree <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed</b> because it is a loan, since she already owes him the money. But if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is betrothed,</b> as at the moment he becomes entitled to the money it is considered as though he gives it to her for her betrothal. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that by the end of the job it is a loan. <b>And</b> this is <b>all the more so</b> if he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you.</b> |
| Tosefta 3:5 | raises a contradiction | Nazir 22b:8 | § The mishna teaches that if a husband said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite and you, and</b> his wife <b>said: Amen, he can nullify her</b> vow <b>and his</b> remains <b>intact. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:5): With regard to one who said to his wife: <b>I am hereby a nazirite and you, and she said: Amen, they are both bound</b> by their vows; <b>and if</b> she did <b>not</b> answer: Amen, <b>they are both permitted, because he made his vow dependent on her vow.</b> In other words, he meant that he would be a nazirite on the condition that she too accept naziriteship upon herself. This <i>baraita</i> teaches that if she says: Amen, he cannot nullify her vow, which apparently contradicts the ruling of the mishna. |
| Tosefta 3:6 | taught | Kiddushin 60b:16 | The mishna teaches that if a man says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will show you two hundred dinars,</b> she is betrothed and he must show her the money. A Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:6): This woman <b>intended to see only his own</b> money, not simply to be shown any two hundred dinars. With regard to the subsequent ruling of the mishna: <b>And if he showed her</b> the money <b>on the table she is not betrothed,</b> the Gemara comments: This is <b>obvious,</b> as the woman wants to see his own money. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach <b>that even if he holds</b> somebody else’s <b>money as</b> part of a <b>joint</b> business <b>venture,</b> nevertheless, as the money does not actually belong to him he has failed to fulfill the condition. |
| Tosefta 3:6 | taught | Kiddushin 60b:21 | § The mishna further teaches: If a one says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will show you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth,</b> she is betrothed, provided that he possesses such land. A Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:6): The woman <b>intended to see only his own</b> land. The mishna further teaches: <b>And if he showed</b> her a plot of land <b>in a valley, she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious;</b> after all, this land does not belong to him. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he maintains</b> the field <b>as a sharecropper [<i>distora</i>],</b> i.e., he owns a share in it. Nevertheless, as the land does not belong to him she did not have this field in mind, and consequently she is not betrothed. |
| Tosefta 3:8 | a tereifa ? But didn’t we learn | Chullin 116b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it suckled from</b> an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:8): <b>One may purchase eggs from gentiles, and we are not concerned</b> that perhaps the eggs came <b>from a carcass nor</b> that they came <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, there is no concern that the kid might have suckled from a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it suckled from a non-kosher</b> animal, and therefore the milk in its stomach is prohibited. |
| Tosefta 3:9 | Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught | Menachot 72a:9 | <b>Rabba said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, which teaches that the <i>omer</i> reaped during the day is valid, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and that</b> mishna in <i>Megilla</i>, which states that any nighttime mitzva performed during the day is not valid, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:9): In a case where a priest <b>was standing and sacrificing the <i>omer</i> meal offering and it became ritually impure</b> in his hand, <b>if there is another</b> measure of barley grain that is ready to be reaped, then one <b>says to</b> the priest: Reap the barley and <b>bring another</b> meal offering <b>in its stead. And if</b> there is <b>no</b> alternative meal offering available, one <b>says to him: Be shrewd and keep silent;</b> i.e., do not tell anyone that it is impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Tosefta 3:10 | as it is taught | Nazir 22a:5 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:10) <b>explicitly:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite, and another</b> woman <b>heard</b> her <b>and said: And I, and</b> the <b>husband of the first one came and nullified her</b> vow, <b>she is permitted and</b> the <b>other</b> woman <b>is prohibited.</b> One can <b>learn from this</b> that the <b>husband severs</b> the vow rather than uproots it. |
| Tosefta 3:11 | raises an objection | Arakhin 20b:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:11): With regard to one who says: <b>This bull is</b> consecrated as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is consecrated property and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. If one says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is consecrated property, and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss, despite the fact that he did not vow to give the monetary value of the bull. |
| Tosefta 3:12 | the latter clause | Arakhin 20b:6 | The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he says: Monetary value of,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he does not say monetary value. As it teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:12): With regard to one who said: It is incumbent upon me to give <b>the monetary value of</b> this <b>bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, the bull is non-sacred</b> property <b>and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. If the bull <b>dies or is stolen, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. <b>But</b> if he sold the bull and received money for the sale, <b>he does bear</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for that money, since he accepted financial responsibility <b>for the monetary value of</b> the bull in his vow. |
| Tosefta 3:15 | The Sages taught | Sotah 9b:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:15): <b>Samson rebelled with his eyes, as it is stated:</b> “Then his father and his mother said to him: Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you go out to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? <b>And Samson said to his father: Get her for me; for she is pleasant in my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). <b>Therefore, the Philistines gouged out his eyes, as it is stated: “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes”</b> (Judges 16:21). |
| Tosefta 3:16 | It is taught | Avodah Zarah43b:20 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:16): <b>Rabbi Yosei said to them: But isn’t it already stated: “And your sin,</b> |
| Tosefta 3:16 | The Sages taught | Sotah 10b:13 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Absalom was</b> excessively <b>proud of his hair,</b> and therefore he was hung by his hair. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:16): <b>Absalom rebelled</b> and sinned <b>due to his hair, as it is stated:</b> “Now in all Israel <b>there was none</b> to be so much praised <b>as Absalom for his beauty;</b> from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <b>And when he shaved his head, as it was at every year’s end that he shaved it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he shaved it, and he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, by the king’s stone”</b> (II Samuel 14:25–26). What is the king’s stone? The Sages <b>taught: A stone with which the people of Tiberias and the people of Tzippori weigh</b> items. |
| Tosefta 3:19 | is so-and-so or not, does naziriteship take effect with regard to him? But isn’t it taught | Nazir 34a:1 | <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> even in a case where the individual in question came before us and identified himself, <b>is</b> the one who claimed to know his identity <b>a nazirite? Since at the time when he vowed he did not know whether</b> the subject of their debate <b>is so-and-so or not, does naziriteship take effect with regard to him? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:19) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon:</b> In the case of the mishna <b>not one of</b> the six people <b>is a nazirite, since naziriteship is imposed</b> upon someone <b>only if</b> the vow is stated with <b>explicitness [<i>hafla’a</i>]</b>. The Torah says that a vow must be “clearly” pronounced, as the verse states: “When either man or woman shall clearly utter [<i>yafli</i>] a vow, the vow of a nazirite” (Numbers 6:2). This verse indicates that his vow is valid only if it is explicit. |
| Tosefta 4:1 | hear | Gittin 33b:6 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:1): If <b>one said to two</b> agents: <b>Give a bill of divorce to my wife, he can render</b> his instructions <b>void</b> before <b>this</b> one, i.e., either of them, even though it is <b>not before that</b> one, i.e., the other one; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He can render</b> his instructions <b>void only</b> when <b>this</b> one <b>is before that</b> one, i.e., when the two of them are together. The Gemara now states the attempted proof. <b>But two are equivalent to: All of you,</b> as the bill of divorce cannot be written and given by fewer than two people, and there is no concern that perhaps one will sign without the other. <b>And</b> yet Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel still <b>disagree,</b> proving that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s reason is that the husband can nullify his instructions only in the same manner that he gave them. |
| Tosefta 4:1 | as it is taught | Sanhedrin 18a:12 | <b>Rather,</b> neither <i>halakha</i> concerning the High Priest is a novelty. But <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach</b> that the <b>king does not judge</b> others <b>and</b> others <b>do not judge him, he also taught</b> that the <b>High Priest judges</b> others <b>and</b> others <b>judge him. And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:1): <b>A High Priest who killed a person intentionally is killed;</b> if he killed <b>unintentionally, he is exiled</b> to a city of refuge, <b>and he transgresses a positive mitzva and a prohibition, and he is like an ordinary</b> person <b>concerning all of his</b> <i>halakhot</i>. |
| Tosefta 4:1 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 19a:8 | The mishna teaches: And <b>when he consoles</b> others in their mourning when they return from burial, the way of all the people is that they pass by one after another and the mourners stand in a line and are consoled, and the appointed person stands in the middle, between him and the people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:1) in a more detailed manner: <b>When</b> the High Priest <b>passes by in the line to console others, the deputy</b> High Priest <b>and</b> the <b>former anointed</b> High Priest, who had served temporarily and then stepped down, are <b>on his right. And the head of the patrilineal family</b> appointed over the priestly watch performing the sacrificial rites that day in the Temple; <b>and the mourners; and all the people</b> are <b>on his left. And when he is standing in the line</b> among the other mourners <b>and is consoled by others, the deputy</b> High Priest is <b>on his right, and the head of the patrilineal family and all the people</b> are <b>on his left.</b> |
| Tosefta 4:3 | is also taught | Nazir 40a:7 | <b>This</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:3): With regard to <b>a nazirite who tore out, uprooted,</b> or <b>pulled out any amount</b> of hair, this <b>negates</b> days of his naziriteship <b>only if</b> he shaved <b>most of his head, and</b> only if he did so <b>in</b> the manner of <b>a razor. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Just as</b> leaving <b>two hairs invalidates his</b> shaving of ritual purity at the end of his term, and the act is considered incomplete, <b>so too,</b> leaving a mere <b>two hairs negates</b> days of <b>his</b> naziriteship, if he shaved during his term. |
| Tosefta 4:4 | Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish | Menachot 23a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>a dry</b> meal offering <b>that was intermingled with</b> a meal offering that was <b>mixed</b> with oil, the priest <b>shall sacrifice</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The priest <b>shall not sacrifice</b> it. <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to <b>a handful of the meal offering of a sinner that was intermingled with a handful of a voluntary meal offering,</b> demonstrating that the oil invalidates the handful of a meal offering of a sinner? |
| Tosefta 4:4 | taught | Sanhedrin 21b:18 | § The mishna teaches that the king <b>writes a Torah scroll for his sake.</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:4): The king fulfills the mitzva <b>provided that he does not beautify himself with</b> the Torah scroll <b>of his ancestors</b> for this purpose, i.e., he must write his own scroll. |
| Tosefta 4:5 | that the father of Rabbi Avin taught | Gittin 53a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to this</b> version of the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the father of Rabbi Avin taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>one who renders</b> another person’s food <b>impure and one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol are subject to a fine, and later <b>they returned to say that even one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another person’s non-sacred produce is liable to pay a fine, <b>why do</b> I need <b>all these</b> cases? In this version, the <i>halakha</i> of one who mixes was added later. After the <i>halakhot</i> concerning one who renders another person’s food impure and one who pours another’s wine were taught, why could the <i>halakha</i> of one who mixes not be derived from those <i>halakhot</i>? |
| Tosefta 4:5 | raises an objection | Kiddushin 52a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav’s opinion that one cannot betroth a woman with stolen property, from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): If one <b>betrothed her with</b> an item taken <b>in robbery, in a forced transaction, or in theft, or if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> from her hand and betrothed her</b> with it, <b>she is betrothed.</b> This indicates that one can betroth a woman with stolen property. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring to <b>her stolen</b> property, and by accepting it from him as betrothal, she indicates that she has released him from his obligation to return it. |
| Tosefta 4:5 | It is taught | Sanhedrin 21b:24 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Ezra was suitable,</b> given his greatness, <b>for</b> the <b>Torah to be given by him to the Jewish people, had Moses not come first</b> and received the Torah already. <b>With regard to Moses</b> the verse <b>states: “And Moses went up to God”</b> (Exodus 19:3), and <b>with regard to Ezra</b> the verse <b>states: “This Ezra went up from Babylon</b> and he was a ready scribe in the Torah of Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given” (Ezra 7:6). <b>Just as</b> the <b>going up stated here,</b> with regard to Moses, is for the <b>Torah,</b> which he received from God and transmitted to the Jewish people, <b>so too,</b> the <b>going up stated there,</b> with regard to Ezra, is for the <b>Torah,</b> as he taught Torah to the Jewish people and was suitable to have originally merited to give it. |
| Tosefta 4:5 | It is taught | Sanhedrin 22a:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Initially, the Torah was given to the Jewish people in this script,</b> <i>Ashurit</i>, which is in use today. <b>Once</b> the Jewish people <b>sinned, it turned into an impairment for them</b> and they began writing with a different script, <i>Libona’a</i>. <b>Once they repented,</b> the first script <b>was returned to them,</b> and they resumed writing with <i>Ashurit</i> script, <b>as it is stated: “Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope; even today do I declare that I will render double [<i>mishne</i>] unto you”</b> (Zechariah 9:12), meaning that God restored to the Jewish people this script that had been changed [<i>nishtanna</i>]. |
| Tosefta 4:6 | The Sages taught | Nazir 45b:9 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:6): <b>All</b> nazirites <b>would throw</b> their hair <b>under the pot, except for an impure</b> nazirite <b>who shaved in</b> the rest of <b>the country, because</b> that one’s <b>hair is buried.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Pure</b> nazirites, whether they are <b>here or there,</b> inside or outside the Temple, <b>would throw</b> their hair under the pot; <b>impure</b> nazirites, whether <b>here or there, would not throw</b> it. <b>And the Rabbis say: None would throw</b> their hair <b>under the pot, except for a pure</b> nazirite <b>in the Temple, because</b> only in that case <b>is</b> the mitzva <b>performed properly,</b> as commanded by the Torah. |
| Tosefta 4:8 | raised an objection to | Gittin 11b:3 | Reish Lakish <b>raised an objection to</b> this ruling from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:8): With regard to <b>bills of divorce that come from a country overseas, and witnesses are signed upon them, even though the names</b> of the witnesses <b>are like the names of gentiles, they are valid, because the names of most Jews outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>are like the names of gentiles.</b> This indicates that a bill of divorce is valid even when the names are not clearly those of gentiles. |
| Tosefta 4:9 | hear | Keritot 27a:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:9): With regard to one who <b>purchased a ram for one <i>sela</i> and he fattened</b> the ram <b>and</b> thereby <b>established</b> its value <b>at two</b> <i>sela</i>, it is <b>valid</b> for sacrifice as a guilt offering. <b>Conclude from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>a person can achieve atonement with an enhancement of consecrated</b> property. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No;</b> the case of <b>one who fattened</b> an animal <b>is different, as he lost eight</b> dinars, which is two <i>sela</i>, in expenses for the animal, including the price he paid. But he cannot achieve atonement if the animal’s value appreciated on its own while in his possession. |
| Tosefta 4:11 | we learned | Bava Metzia31b:13 | § The mishna teaches: If in the course of tending to and returning the lost item, the finder <b>was idle from</b> labor that would have earned him <b>a <i>sela</i>, he shall not say to</b> the owner of the item: <b>Give me a <i>sela</i></b> to compensate me for my lost income. <b>Rather,</b> the owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>a laborer.</b> The Gemara cites that <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:11): The owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>an idle laborer.</b> |
| Tosefta 4:11 | taught | Sotah 11a:7 | The next verse states: <b>“And he said to his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel</b> are too many and too mighty for us” (Exodus 1:9). It was <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:11): <b>He,</b> Pharaoh, <b>initiated the proposal. Therefore,</b> of his people, <b>he was stricken first. He initiated the proposal, as it is written: “And he said to his people.” Therefore, he was stricken first, as it is written:</b> “And the frogs shall come up <b>both upon you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants”</b> (Exodus 7:29). |
| Tosefta 5:1 | of Shmuel | Avodah Zarah43b:18 | The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:1): <b>Respectable</b> locations for idolatrous figures are <b>upon bracelets, or upon nose rings, or upon rings. Disgraceful</b> locations are <b>upon</b> large <b>pots, or upon</b> small <b>kettles [<i>hakumkemasin</i>], or upon samovars, or upon sheets, or upon towels.</b> |
| Tosefta 5:2 | It is taught | Gittin 58b:1 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:2) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>one</b> first <b>purchased</b> a field belonging to a married woman <b>from the wife,</b> so that if her husband were to predecease or divorce her, the purchaser would then own it fully, <b>and</b> afterward <b>he returned and purchased</b> the same field <b>from the husband,</b> so that he will have the right to use it in the interim, <b>his purchase stands.</b> If he first acquired the field <b>from the husband, and</b> afterward <b>he returned and purchased</b> the same field <b>from the wife, his purchase is void, unless</b> the woman <b>writes him a guarantee.</b> This supports Shmuel’s opinion that only when the prior owner writes the buyer a guarantee is it assumed that he sold him the field wholeheartedly. |
| Tosefta 5:2 | The Sages taught | Gittin 58b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:2): If property comes into one’s possession <b>due to</b> payment <b>of a debt or due to unjust seizure [<i>anparot</i>]</b> of the land by a gentile, the previously mentioned laws of <b>Sicarii do not</b> apply. <b>And</b> the <b>unjustly seized land itself must remain</b> in the possession of the gentile who seized it <b>for</b> at least <b>twelve months</b> before another buyer can take possession of it. |
| Tosefta 5:2 | It is taught | Kiddushin 75a:19 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:2): <b>And similarly Rabbi Elazar says: A Samaritan</b> man <b>may not marry a Samaritan woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The Sages <b>established him</b> to be <b>like</b> the descendant of <b>a convert, after ten generations. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the descendant of <b>a convert,</b> he <b>is permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i></b> if he is <b>within ten generations</b> of both parents being descendants of converts; <b>from this</b> point <b>forward</b> the descendant of a convert <b>is prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>,</b> as people no longer remember that he has the lineage of a convert. |
| Tosefta 5:3 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 72b:15 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:3): <b>A convert may marry a <i>mamzeret</i></b> <i>ab initio</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: A convert may not marry a <i>mamzeret</i>. A convert, an emancipated slave, and a <i>ḥalal</i> are</b> all <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who deems it permitted for a convert to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Five congregations are written,</b> meaning, the word congregation appears five times in the Torah with regard to various people of flawed lineage who are prohibited from entering the congregation of God. |
| Tosefta 5:4 | Rabbi Ya’akov, as it is taught | Bava Kamma98b:6 | § The mishna teaches that if one robbed another of <b>leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <b>says to</b> his victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden</b> one <b>says: That which is yours is before you? Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:4): If there was <b>an ox that killed</b> a person and is consequently liable to be stoned, and <b>before</b> the court <b>sentenced it</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the ox, the <b>sale</b> is valid; if <b>he consecrated it,</b> the <b>consecration</b> is valid; if <b>he slaughtered it, its flesh is permitted;</b> if <b>a bailee returned it to its owner, it is returned.</b> |
| Tosefta 5:4 | the Sages taught | Gittin 61a:5 | § The mishna teaches: <b>One does not protest against poor gentiles</b> who come to take <b>gleanings, forgotten</b> sheaves, <b>and the produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> although they are meant exclusively for the Jewish poor, <b>on account of the ways of peace.</b> Similarly, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:4): <b>One sustains poor gentiles</b> along <b>with poor Jews, and one visits sick gentiles</b> along <b>with sick Jews, and one buries dead gentiles</b> along <b>with dead Jews.</b> All this is done <b>on account of the ways of peace,</b> to foster peaceful relations between Jews and gentiles. |
| Tosefta 5:5 | The Sages taught | Kiddushin 72b:12 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:5): <b><i>Mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites</b> will be <b>pure in the future;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Meir says: They</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>pure. Rabbi Yosei said to him: But hasn’t it already been stated: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean</b> from all your uncleanness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you” (Ezekiel 36:25)? <b>Rabbi Meir said to him: When it says: “From all your uncleanness, and from all your idols,”</b> this emphasizes that God will purify people from these types of impurity, <b>but not from <i>mamzer</i> status. Rabbi Yosei said to him: When it says: “Will I cleanse you,”</b> at the end of the verse, <b>you must say</b> this means <b>even from <i>mamzer</i> status.</b> |
| Tosefta 5:8 | It is taught | Ketubot 67a:2 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:8) with regard to the daughter of Nakdimon ben Guryon: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said</b> in the form of an oath: I pray that <b>I will</b> not <b>see the consolation</b> of the Jewish people <b>if I did not see her gathering barley</b> kernels <b>from between the hooves of horses in Akko. I recited this verse about her: “If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed your kids,</b> beside the shepherds’ tents” (Song of Songs 1:8). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“your kids [<i>gediyotayikh</i>]” but rather</b> read it as <b>your bodies [<i>geviyotayikh</i>].</b> This woman is compelled to follow the sheep to the pastures in order to sustain her own body from the leftovers of their food. |
| Tosefta 5:10 | but isn’t it taught | Kiddushin 82a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that a bachelor may not teach children? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>due to the children</b> themselves, that it is suspected that he may engage in homosexual intercourse with them, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:10): <b>They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of</b> engaging in <b>homosexual intercourse nor of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>an animal. Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>A bachelor</b> may not be a teacher of children <b>due to the mothers of the children,</b> who come to the school from time to time, with whom he might sin. Similarly, <b>a woman</b> may not serve as a teacher to children <b>because</b> she may come to be secluded with <b>the fathers of the children.</b> |
| Tosefta 5:13 | As it is taught | Bava Kamma23b:11 | <b>And from where do you say</b> this? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:13): With regard to <b>one who enters the courtyard of a property owner without</b> his <b>permission, and the property owner’s ox gores</b> the intruder <b>and</b> he <b>dies, the ox</b> receives the penalty of <b>stoning while</b> the <b>owner</b> is <b>exempt from</b> having to pay <b>ransom.</b> |
| Tosefta 6:1 | The Sages taught | Gittin 63a:13 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1) that if the woman says to an agent: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me, and</b> the agent says to her husband: <b>Your wife said: Receive my bill of divorce for me, and</b> the husband <b>says: Deliver and give</b> it <b>to her,</b> or: <b>Acquire</b> it <b>for her, or: Receive</b> it <b>for her,</b> once the husband hands the bill of divorce to the agent for receipt, if he <b>seeks to retract</b> his decision <b>he cannot retract</b> it, because the divorce has already taken effect. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If the husband said: <b>Deliver and give</b> it <b>to her,</b> and <b>he seeks to retract</b> his designation, then as long as it has not yet reached the woman’s possession <b>he can retract</b> it, because the husband designated him an agent for delivery. However, if the husband said: <b>Acquire</b> it <b>for her, or: Receive</b> it <b>for her,</b> and he <b>seeks to retract</b> his decision <b>he cannot retract</b> it. |
| Tosefta 6:1 | And it is taught with regard to | Nazir 60a:3 | <b>And it is taught with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>And he shaves</b> with <b>four</b> separate acts of <b>shaving,</b> each time for its own reason. How so? For his <b>first shaving,</b> after the thirty days of an unspecified naziriteship or at the end of the period he vowed to observe naziriteship, he <b>brings</b> two <b>birds</b> of a leper: One is slaughtered over spring water and the other is sent away (Leviticus 14:4–7). |
| Tosefta 6:1 | hear | Nazir 61a:4 | <b>What</b> then is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>And he shaves</b> with <b>four</b> acts of <b>shaving.</b> Now <b>if it should enter your mind</b> that the reason is <b>for the sake of removing hair of impurity, even three</b> shavings should <b>be enough for him,</b> two for his leprosy, and the last one for his naziriteship of purity. Since the third shaving is performed only to remove his hair of impurity so that he can start his pure naziriteship afresh, why is it included? <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that all four shavings are <b>due to</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of shaving. The Gemara says: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the case. |
| Tosefta 6:1 | said to him: Yes, I teach | Shevuot 45b:12 | § <b>Rami bar Ḥama would cite</b> this verse <b>about Rav Sheshet: “And David laid up these words in his heart”</b> (I Samuel 21:13), as Rav Sheshet took it upon himself to find sources that would support or contradict the statements of Rav and Shmuel. <b>As</b> it is recounted that <b>Rav Sheshet encountered Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Does the Master teach any</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>about a hired worker?</b> Rabba bar Shmuel <b>said to him: Yes, I teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>A hired worker within his time</b> for receiving wages <b>takes an oath and receives</b> payment. <b>How so?</b> This applies in a case <b>when</b> the worker <b>said to</b> the employer: <b>You hired me but did not give me my wages, and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I hired you and gave you your wages. But</b> if the hired worker <b>said to him: You fixed two</b> coins <b>as my</b> payment, <b>and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I fixed only one</b> coin <b>as your</b> payment, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> who must provide witnesses to testify that the wage was the greater sum. |
| Tosefta 6:1 | It is taught | Sotah 31a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: It is stated with regard to Job</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is stated with regard to Abraham</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Genesis 22:12). <b>Just as</b> the description <b>“God-fearing,” which is stated with regard to Abraham,</b> is referring to Abraham’s fearing God <b>out of love, so too,</b> the description <b>“God-fearing” that is stated with regard to Job</b> indicates that Job feared God <b>out of love.</b> |
| Tosefta 6:2 | hear | Gittin 63a:8 | The Gemara states: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an objection to the statement of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:2). With regard to a woman who said to an agent: <b>Bring me my bill of divorce, and</b> the agent said to her husband: <b>Your wife said: Receive my bill of divorce for me;</b> or a woman who said: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me, and</b> the agent said to her husband: <b>Your wife said: Bring me my bill of divorce, and</b> the husband <b>said</b> to the agent: <b>Deliver and give</b> it <b>to her,</b> or: <b>Acquire</b> it <b>for her, or: Receive</b> it <b>for her, if</b> the husband <b>seeks to retract</b> his designation <b>he may retract</b> it. However, <b>once the bill of divorce reaches her possession,</b> she is <b>divorced.</b> |
| Tosefta 6:2 | It is taught | Ketubot 67a:4 | <b>And moreover,</b> one can ask: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:2) that the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>gold is like utensils</b> and that <b>gold</b> dinars <b>are like silver</b> coins. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to exchange them,</b> the court <b>appraises them, and they are</b> recorded <b>at their appraised worth,</b> no more or less. The Gemara clarifies: <b>To which</b> clause is <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> referring, when he comments that they are not exchanged? <b>If we say</b> he is commenting <b>on the latter clause</b> concerning the gold dinars, <b>by inference</b> it may be understood <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that gold dinars have the same status as cash, <b>even in a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to exchange them. But they are not used</b> and do not function as liquid money in a place where they are not exchanged. Why, then, does the husband need to raise the value as though they were functional cash? |
| Tosefta 6:2 | As it is taught | Menachot 21b:4 | The Gemara explains its challenge: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:2): <b>You are found</b> to be <b>saying</b> that <b>the salt is placed in three locations</b> in the Temple: <b>In the Chamber of the Salt, and on the ramp, and on top of</b> the <b>altar.</b> It is placed <b>in the Chamber of the Salt, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the hides of sacrificial</b> animals that are given to them. It is placed <b>on the ramp, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the</b> sacrificial <b>limbs.</b> It is placed <b>on top of</b> the <b>altar, since</b> the priests <b>salted there the handful</b> of the meal offering, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal offering of priests, the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations, and the bird burnt offering.</b> Evidently, it was permitted for the priests to add salt to their portions of sacrificial meat. |
| Tosefta 6:4 | The Sages taught | Gittin 63b:23 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> with regard to a woman <b>who says</b> to her agent: <b>Take my bill of divorce for me, if</b> the husband <b>seeks to retract</b> his decision, <b>he cannot retract</b> it. He is an agent for receipt and she is divorced once the bill of divorce reaches his possession. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:4): If the woman said to an agent: <b>Take</b> my bill of divorce <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Lift</b> my bill of divorce <b>for me, or:</b> The bill of divorce <b>will be in your possession for me, all of them are expressions of receipt,</b> and the divorce takes effect as soon as the bill of divorce reaches the possession of the agent. |
| Tosefta 6:4 | The Sages taught | Menachot 21b:1 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:4): With regard to <b>salt that is on the limb</b> of an offering, one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, but in the case of salt <b>that is on the ramp or that is on top of the altar,</b> one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And Rav Mattana said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that the salt found upon a sacrificial limb is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property? The verse states: <b>“And you shall sacrifice them before the Lord, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the Lord”</b> (Ezekiel 43:24). In this verse, the limbs, together with the salt, are termed a burnt offering, and therefore the salt on the limb is also subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property. |
| Tosefta 6:4 | The Sages taught | Nazir 62b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:4): With regard <b>to what</b> matter can <b>his master force</b> a slave? <b>With regard to naziriteship. However,</b> he <b>cannot</b> force his slave in the case <b>of</b> other <b>vows and valuations.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is apparently saying that a master cannot prevent his slave from fulfilling the terms of a vow. |
| Tosefta 6:6 | The Sages taught | Gittin 76a:12 | § The Gemara continues discussing a conditional bill of divorce. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:6): If a husband <b>said to</b> his wife <b>in the presence of two</b> people: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will serve</b> my <b>father</b> for <b>two years, and</b> afterward <b>he returned and said to her in the presence of two</b> other people: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, the latter statement does not nullify the first</b> statement. Rather, he is giving her the choice, and if she fulfills either one of the conditions, the bill of divorce is valid. If <b>she wishes, she serves</b> his father and is divorced, or if <b>she wishes, she gives him two hundred dinars</b> and is divorced. |
| Tosefta 6:7 | The Sages taught | Gittin 84a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:7) that if a man says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you marry so-and-so, she may not marry</b> that man, <b>but if she marries</b> him the marriage is valid and <b>she</b> need <b>not leave</b> her husband. |
| Tosefta 6:9 | this is also taught | Gittin 81b:22 | The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:9): The <b>dispute</b> between <b>ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva</b> with regard to <b>a bare bill of divorce</b> that has more tied folds than witnesses is <b>only</b> in a case where <b>its ties</b> total <b>seven and its witnesses</b> total <b>six,</b> or its ties total <b>six and its witnesses</b> total <b>five,</b> or its ties total <b>five and its witnesses</b> total <b>four,</b> or its ties total <b>four and its witnesses</b> total <b>three.</b> |
| Tosefta 6:10 | raises an objection | Gittin 84b:2 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:10): If the husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you eat pig meat; or</b> similarly, <b>if she was a non-priestess,</b> i.e., the daughter of an Israelite, and he stipulated: <b>On the condition that you partake of <i>teruma</i>; or if she was a nazirite</b> and he stipulated: <b>On the condition that you drink wine</b> (see Numbers 6:3); in all of these cases, if <b>the condition is fulfilled it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce, and if not, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This <b>works out well according to Rava,</b> who holds that a condition that she should perform a forbidden act is binding; <b>according to Abaye</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> |
| Tosefta 6:10 | him | Ketubot 69b:12 | <b>A certain older man came</b> and <b>taught</b> before <b>him</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:10): With regard to <b>one who says</b> upon his deathbed: <b>Give a shekel to my sons for</b> each <b>week,</b> the court assesses the sons’ needs. <b>And</b> if it is <b>appropriate</b> that the court <b>gives them a <i>sela</i>,</b> which is worth two shekels, the court <b>gives them a <i>sela</i>.</b> Had the father known they would need the additional money, he would not have begrudged them. <b>But if he said: Give them only a shekel,</b> the court <b>gives them only a shekel.</b> Because their father spoke explicitly, there is no room to question his intentions. If they need more, they should take charitable aid. <b>And if he said: If they die</b> without inheritors, <b>others should inherit in their stead,</b> then <b>whether he said: Give</b> a shekel <b>or whether he said: Don’t give</b> more than a shekel, the court <b>gives them only a shekel,</b> since it is clear that he wants the inheritance to be doled out in such a way that it will remain intact for whoever will receive it. The older man asked Ilfa where this <i>halakha</i> is indicated in the Mishna. |
| Tosefta 6:11 | raise a contradiction | Gittin 28a:10 | § <b>Abaye raises a contradiction before Rabba: We learned</b> in the mishna that in the case of an agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce</b> to a woman <b>and left</b> the husband when he was <b>elderly or sick,</b> the agent <b>gives her</b> the bill of divorce <b>based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> the husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive. And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:11) that states: If one is leaving his place of residence, and in order to preclude a situation where his wife would have the status of a deserted wife he gives her a conditional bill of divorce and stipulates: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> that will take effect <b>one hour prior to my death, it is immediately prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> due to the concern that he may die immediately after an hour has passed. Apparently, there is a concern that one may die at any point. |
| Tosefta 6:11 | as it is taught | Zevachim 53a:6 | The Gemara discusses the aforementioned dispute. <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:11): The <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the upper</b> half of the altar, e.g., the blood of a sin offering, <b>is placed</b> anywhere <b>from the red line</b> that circumscribed the middle of the altar <b>and above.</b> The <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the lower</b> half of the altar <b>is placed</b> anywhere <b>from the red line or below it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Tosefta 6:16 | as it is taught | Bava Kamma91a:12 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> the slave is not emancipated, <b>because we say</b> that it is possible that it was the slave <b>who frightened himself,</b> resulting in his blindness or deafness, but it was not the actual strike that caused it. An injury can result from being frightened, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:16): <b>One who frightens another</b> and thereby causes him injury is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. How so?</b> If <b>one shouted into</b> another’s <b>ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. But if <b>he held him and shouted into his ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>liable</b> according to human laws as well, as he physically took hold of him. |
| Tosefta 6:25 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma32b:6 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:25): With regard to <b>one who entered the workshop of a carpenter without</b> the latter’s <b>permission, and a chip of wood flew off and hit him in the face and he died,</b> the carpenter is <b>exempt. But if he entered</b> the shop <b>with permission,</b> the carpenter is <b>liable.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:1 | The Gemara raises an objection | Gittin 71a:7 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> to this based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:1): <b>Just as</b> the judges of the court <b>investigate him,</b> one who lost his ability to speak, <b>with regard to bills of divorce, so too,</b> the judges <b>investigate him with regard to business</b> transactions, <b>testimonies, and inheritances. In any event it teaches: Testimonies,</b> which proves that even one unable to speak can give testimony. |
| Tosefta 7:2 | The Sages taught | Gittin 73a:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:2): If a husband says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce from today if I die from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> But if he said: This is your bill of divorce <b>if I will not arise</b> healthy <b>from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him,</b> then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:2 | raises an objection | Sanhedrin 36a:16 | <b>Rav says: A person may teach his student</b> the relevant material <b>and</b> then <b>judge</b> cases of <b>capital law with him,</b> and this student can participate in the deliberations and serve as one of the judges. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:2): In cases of <b>ritual purity and impurity,</b> if two of the judges are <b>a father and his son,</b> or <b>a teacher and his student,</b> the court <b>counts them</b> as <b>two</b> opinions. By inference, in cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law, and</b> cases of <b>laws</b> involving the punishment <b>of lashes,</b> as well as court proceedings concerning <b>sanctification of the month and the intercalation of the year,</b> if two of the judges are <b>a father and his son,</b> or <b>a teacher and his student,</b> the court <b>counts them</b> as <b>only one</b> opinion, as it is assumed the son or student will merely echo the opinion of his father or teacher. This contradicts the ruling of Rav. |
| Tosefta 7:3 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra127b:12 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:3): If the court <b>had a presumption concerning</b> a son <b>that he is a firstborn, and his father said concerning another</b> son of his <b>that he is</b> his <b>firstborn,</b> the father’s statement is <b>deemed credible.</b> If the court <b>had a presumption concerning</b> a son <b>that he is not a firstborn, and his father said</b> that <b>he is</b> his <b>firstborn,</b> the father’s statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:3 | This is also taught | Sanhedrin 33b:10 | The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:3): <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>those liable</b> to be <b>exiled</b> for killing unintentionally is the same with regard to retrying a court case as the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who killed intentionally, who is found liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment? It is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy employing the term <b>“murderer”</b> stated with regard to one who kills intentionally and the term <b>“murderer”</b> stated with regard to one who kills unintentionally. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>those liable</b> to receive forty <b>lashes</b> is the same with regard to retrying a court case as the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who killed intentionally, who is found liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment? It is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy employing the term <b>“wicked”</b> stated with regard to one who kills intentionally and the term <b>“wicked”</b> stated with regard to those liable to receive lashes. |
| Tosefta 7:4 | as it is taught | Bava Batra124a:2 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): <b>A firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred <b>after the death of</b> the sons’ <b>father. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>a firstborn does take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death,</b> e.g., the birth of a calf, <b>but not of the enhancement that the orphans caused after their father’s death.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:4 | The Sages taught | Gittin 73b:16 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): In a case where the husband said: This is your bill of divorce from now if I die from this illness, <b>during the days between,</b> before he dies, <b>her husband is entitled to</b> anything that <b>she finds,</b> i.e., any lost item that cannot be returned to its owner, in accordance with the rabbinic principle that any lost item found by a wife belongs to her husband. <b>And</b> he is entitled to the profits from <b>her earnings, and</b> he is entitled to <b>annul her vows</b> (see Numbers 30:7–9), <b>and he inherits</b> from <b>her</b> if she predeceases him, |
| Tosefta 7:4 | The Sages taught | Gittin 73b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): If, after the giving of this bill of divorce witnesses <b>saw that she secluded herself with</b> her husband <b>in the dark, or that she slept with him under the foot of the bed, one is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they were engaged in another matter,</b> i.e., sexual intercourse. <b>And one is concerned due to</b> their action of <b>licentiousness but one is not concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: One is also concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:5 | The Gemara raises an objection | Gittin 74a:17 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:5): If one says to a woman: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars,</b> then <b>even though the bill of divorce was torn or lost she is divorced. And she may not marry another</b> man <b>until she gives</b> her first husband the money. |
| Tosefta 7:5 | as it is taught | Sanhedrin 36b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>But there is another</b> difference, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:5): The court <b>does not seat on the Sanhedrin</b> a very <b>old person or one who is castrated or one who has no children,</b> as those who did not recently raise children may lack compassion. <b>Rabbi Yehuda adds: Even a cruel person</b> is not eligible. The Gemara comments: <b>And the opposite of this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to one who entices</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). |
| Tosefta 7:6 | The Sages taught | Gittin 76a:3 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:6): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will serve</b> my <b>father</b> for <b>two years, or</b> he said: This is your bill of divorce <b>on the condition that you will nurse my son</b> for <b>two years, even if the condition was not fulfilled it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce because he did not say to her: If you will serve</b> my father then this will be a valid bill of divorce, and <b>if you will not serve</b> him it will not be a valid bill of divorce, or: <b>If you will nurse</b> my son then this will be a valid bill of divorce, <b>and if you will not nurse</b> him it will not be a valid bill of divorce. And if he did not state his condition as a compound condition, stipulating both positive and negative outcomes, the condition is void and the bill of divorce is valid. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:6 | raises a contradiction | Gittin 76a:7 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:6): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will serve</b> my <b>father</b> for <b>two years,</b> or he said to her: This is your bill of divorce <b>on the condition that you will nurse my son</b> for <b>two years,</b> and <b>the father died or the son died,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as its condition was not fulfilled. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:7 | The Sages taught | Sotah 32b:19 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:7): <b><i>Shema</i></b> must be recited in Hebrew <b>as it is written;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It may be recited <b>in any language.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:8 | The Sages taught | Gittin 84a:13 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:8) that if a man says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you ascend to the sky,</b> or <b>on the condition that you descend to the depths</b> of the sea, or <b>on the condition that you swallow a four-cubit reed,</b> or <b>on the condition that you bring me a hundred-cubit reed,</b> or <b>on the condition that you cross the Great Sea,</b> i.e., the Mediterranean Sea, <b>by foot,</b> or on any other condition that it is impossible to fulfill, <b>it is not a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:9 | raises a contradiction | Gittin 76a:20 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Antipatris was in the Galilee?</b> It appears from the mishna that Antipatris was on the border of the Galilee, since the condition of the resident of Judea became void by his reaching Antipatris and returning. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> based on what is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:9): <b>Antipatris</b> is <b>in Judea, and Kefar Otnai</b> is <b>in the Galilee.</b> And with regard to the area <b>between them, a stringent</b> ruling <b>is placed on it,</b> and it is treated as though it is located in both Judea and the Galilee. If the husband who made such a condition reached this area and returned home, it is uncertain whether the condition attached to the bill of divorce was fulfilled. Therefore, there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced</b> |
| Tosefta 7:10 | But isn’t it taught | Bava Batra119a:2 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says: And the sons</b> of the spies and of the protesters <b>took</b> portions of the land <b>in the merit of their paternal grandfathers and in the merit of their maternal grandfathers</b> if those grandfathers were among those who left Egypt. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:10): The sons of the spies and of the protesters took portions <b>in their own merit?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states they took portions in the merit of their grandfathers, is written <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt;</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that they took portions in their own merit, is written <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael. |
| Tosefta 7:10 | The Sages taught | Bava Metzia81a:13 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:10): If one said: <b>Safeguard</b> my property <b>for me and I will safeguard</b> your property <b>for you,</b> or: <b>Lend</b> money <b>to me and I will lend</b> money <b>to you,</b> or: <b>Safeguard</b> my property <b>for me and I will lend</b> money <b>to you,</b> or: <b>Lend</b> money <b>to me and I will safeguard</b> your property <b>for you, they all become paid bailees for each other.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are they liable as paid bailees? <b>Is</b> this not a situation of <b>safeguarding with the owners? Rav Pappa</b> again <b>said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he said to him: Safeguard</b> my property <b>for me today and I will safeguard</b> your property <b>for you tomorrow.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:10 | is taught | Gittin 76b:7 | The Gemara comments that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:10) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> if at <b>any time I will depart from your presence</b> for <b>thirty</b> consecutive <b>days, and he was going and coming, going and coming</b> for the entire thirty days, <b>since he was not secluded with her</b> during that time, <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And one is not concerned</b> that it is now considered <b>an outdated bill of divorce, because he was not secluded with her.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:13 | raises an objection | Sotah 40b:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:13): <b>And where does</b> the High Priest <b>read</b> from the Torah scroll? He reads from it <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> He reads from it <b>on the Temple Mount, as it is stated:</b> |
| Tosefta 7:18 | And isn’t it taught | Bava Batra130a:4 | The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is saying</b> that one’s statement stands <b>even</b> in a case where he bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son,</b> as although he bequeathed it to one who is not currently his heir, the beneficiary would be fit to inherit from him if the current heirs die, and this would be contrary to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, this is difficult. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: My father and the Rabbis did not disagree about</b> a case where one bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son;</b> in a case such as this, my father concedes <b>that he has said nothing.</b> |
| Tosefta 7:18 | the Sages taught | Sotah 42a:16 | With respect to the mishna’s comments about the verse: <b>“Let not your heart faint; fear not,</b> nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them” (Deuteronomy 20:3), <b>the Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18): The priest <b>speaks with them twice, one</b> time when they are gathered for war <b>at the border, and one</b> time when they are <b>on the battlefield</b> itself. When they are <b>at the border, what does he say?</b> |
| Tosefta 7:18 | One who builds a gateway, | Sotah 44a:8 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> are the men <b>who do not return</b> from the ranks: <b>One who builds a gateway,</b> or an enclosed veranda, or a balcony…Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who rebuilds a house as it stood originally would not return. A Sage taught (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18): <b>If</b> one <b>adds one</b> additional <b>row of stones [<i>dimos</i>] to</b> the original structure, <b>he returns</b> from the ranks. That is enough to render it a new building. The mishna further teaches: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even one who builds a</b> new <b>brick house in the Sharon would not return.</b> A Sage <b>taught:</b> This is <b>because</b> the owners <b>renew it twice in</b> a period of <b>seven years,</b> and it is therefore not considered a permanent structure. |
| Tosefta 8:1 | as it is taught | Bava Batra138a:3 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): If <b>one wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property to another, and there were slaves</b> among his property, <b>and the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, if their second master,</b> i.e., the recipient, <b>was a priest, they partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, as his protest is ignored. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, the</b> giver or his <b>heirs have already acquired them,</b> and they are the slaves’ owners. |
| Tosefta 8:1 | This is also taught | Gittin 78a:17 | <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): If <b>he said to</b> his wife: <b>Take this promissory note, or</b> if <b>she pulled it out from behind him, read it, and</b> saw that <b>it is her bill of divorce; it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce until he says to her: This is your bill of divorce.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Actually, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce until he takes it from her and gives it to her again, and says to her: This is your bill of divorce.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:1 | This is also taught | Gittin 78b:6 | <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> bill of divorce <b>that is closer to her than</b> it is <b>to him, and a dog came and took it</b> before the bill of divorce reached her hand, <b>she is not divorced.</b> The Gemara asks: Why is it that <b>she is not divorced?</b> Once it was closer to her, before the dog took it, the divorce should have taken effect. <b>Must she continue guarding</b> her bill of divorce <b>indefinitely,</b> even after the bill of divorce took effect? |
| Tosefta 8:1 | The Sages taught | Sotah 33b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): <b>How did the Jewish people cross the Jordan? Every day the Ark would travel behind</b> the <b>two flags</b> of Judah and Reuben, <b>but</b> on <b>that day</b> the Ark <b>traveled in front, as it is stated: “Behold, the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing before you”</b> (Joshua 3:11). <b>On every</b> other <b>day, the Levites would carry the Ark, but on this day the priests carried it, as is stated: “And when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord,</b> the Lord of all the earth, <b>shall rest”</b> (Joshua 3:13). |
| Tosefta 8:2 | The Gemara raises an objection | Gittin 19b:14 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:2): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is hereby your bill of divorce, and</b> instead of opening it and looking at it <b>she took it and threw it into the sea, or into a fire, or into anything that destroys</b> it; <b>and he later said:</b> It wasn’t actually a bill of divorce, rather <b>it is a document of appeasement</b> [<b><i>shetar passim</i></b>], a symbolic promissory note meant only for display so that the person holding it will be considered to be wealthy; or he said: <b>It is a document of trust,</b> which is a false promissory note given by one person to another, trusting that he will not make use of it until there has been an actual loan; then <b>she is divorced. And he does not have</b> the power <b>to make her forbidden</b> to everyone else as a married woman by saying that it was not a bill of divorce and they are still married. |
| Tosefta 8:2 | It is taught | Sotah 33b:12 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:2) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In three</b> different <b>places the priests carried the Ark.</b> They carried it <b>when</b> the Jewish people <b>crossed the Jordan, and when they surrounded Jericho</b> (Joshua 6:6), <b>and when they returned it to its</b> proper <b>place</b> in the Holy of Holies during the reign of King Solomon (I Kings 8:6). |
| Tosefta 8:4 | hear | Bava Batra129b:4 | <b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one states: <b>My property</b> will go <b>to you</b> after my death for your use during your lifetime, <b>and after you</b> die, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, <b>and after</b> the one who inherits <b>after you</b> dies, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, then in this case, when <b>the first</b> recipient <b>dies, the second acquires</b> it, and when <b>the second dies, the third acquires</b> it. <b>And if the second dies during the lifetime of the first, the property returns</b> after his death <b>to the heirs of the first,</b> and does not go to the third designated recipient, as his right was to inherit it from the second one, who never received it. |
| Tosefta 8:4 | Reish Lakish | Bava Batra136b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one states: <b>My property</b> will go <b>to you</b> after my death for your use during your lifetime, <b>and after you</b> die, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, <b>and after</b> the one who inherits after you dies, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, in this case, when <b>the first</b> recipient <b>dies, the second acquires</b> it, and when <b>the second dies, the third acquires</b> it. |
| Tosefta 8:4 | raises a contradiction | Bava Batra137a:2 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one says: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you, to so-and-so, the first one may enter</b> the property <b>and sell</b> it <b>and consume</b> the profits; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The first one has only</b> the right of <b>consumption of the produce.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:5 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 38a:10 | The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> this serves <b>to tell of the greatness of</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, as when a person stamps several coins with one seal, they are all similar to each other. But the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, stamped all people with the seal of Adam the first man, as all are his offspring, and not one of them is similar to another. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:5): The fact that Adam the first man was created alone serves <b>to declare the greatness of the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, as a person stamps several coins with one seal, and they are all similar to each other. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, stamps all people with the seal of Adam the first</b> man, <b>and not one of them</b> is <b>similar to another. As it is stated: “It is changed like clay under the seal and they stand as a garment”</b> (Job 38:14). The verse describes people as being created “under the seal,” but their external appearance is different, just as garments can differ in appearance. |
| Tosefta 8:6 | valid. The Sages taught | Gittin 88a:13 | § It is stated in the mishna: With regard to the names of the husband and wife, if the scribe <b>wrote his surname</b> or nickname <b>and her surname</b> or nickname, it is <b>valid. The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:6): <b>A surname</b> from one’s <b>forefathers</b> is valid <b>with regard to bills of divorce until ten generations</b> after the forefather. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> It is <b>valid</b> for only <b>three generations; from this</b> point <b>forward</b> it is <b>invalid.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:7 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 38a:13 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:7): <b>Adam</b> the first man <b>was created on Shabbat eve</b> at the close of the six days of Creation. <b>And for what</b> reason was this so? <b>So that the heretics will not</b> be able to <b>say</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, had a partner,</b> i.e., Adam, <b>in the acts of Creation. Alternatively,</b> he was created on Shabbat eve so <b>that if</b> a person <b>becomes haughty,</b> God can <b>say to him: The mosquito preceded you in the acts of Creation,</b> as you were created last. <b>Alternatively,</b> he was created on Shabbat eve <b>in order that he enter into the mitzva</b> of observing Shabbat <b>immediately.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:9 | It is taught | Sotah 37a:7 | § The Gemara returns to discussing the blessing and curses. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:9) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: It is impossible to say</b> that the tribe of <b>Levi</b> stood <b>below,</b> between the two mountains, <b>as it is already stated</b> that they were <b>above,</b> in the verse: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon and Levi and Judah” (Deuteronomy 27:12). <b>And it is impossible to say</b> that they stood <b>above</b> on the mountain <b>because it is already stated:</b> “And all of Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the Ark and on that side before the priests the Levites” (Joshua 8:33). This shows that the Levites stood <b>below,</b> between the mountains, with the Ark. |
| Tosefta 8:10 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra135b:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:10): <b>Which</b> deed <b>is</b> considered <b>a <i>dayetikei</i>,</b> and is collected by the designated recipient after the death of the giver? <b>Any</b> deed <b>in which it is written: This will be to stand and exist</b> after my death. <b>And which</b> type <b>is</b> considered a deed of <b>gift? Any</b> deed <b>in which it is written: From today and after</b> my <b>death.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:10 | The Sages taught | Sotah 37a:11 | § It is stated in the mishna: <b>They turned to face Mount Gerizim and opened with a blessing:</b> Blessed be the man who does not make a graven or molten image (see Deuteronomy 27:15), and these people and those people, i.e., the two groups standing on either mountain, answered: Amen. Then they turned to face Mount Ebal and opened with the curse: “Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image” (Deuteronomy 27:15), and these people and those people answered: Amen. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:10): The blessings and curses include <b>a general blessing</b> for one who fulfills the entire Torah, and <b>a particular blessing</b> for each individual statement mentioned in the blessings and curses. Likewise, there is <b>a general curse</b> for one who does not fulfill the entire Torah and <b>a particular curse</b> for each individual statement. And for each of the blessings and curses there is a mitzva <b>to learn and to teach,</b> and <b>to keep and to perform. Consequently,</b> |
| Tosefta 8:11 | as it is taught | Sotah 37b:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it is <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> that they disagree, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:11): <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: General statements were said at Sinai,</b> i.e., Moses received general mitzvot at Sinai, including the Ten Commandments. <b>And</b> the <b>details</b> of the mitzvot were explained to Moses at a later time <b>in the Tent of Meeting. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Both <b>general statements and</b> the <b>details</b> of mitzvot <b>were said at Sinai, and</b> later <b>repeated in the Tent of Meeting, and</b> reiterated <b>a third time</b> by Moses to the Jewish people <b>in the plains of Moab.</b> Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, and counts Mount Sinai and the Tent of Meeting as two distinct places where all of the mitzvot were given. |
| Tosefta 8:15 | tanna , as it is taught | Zevachim 77a:12 | § The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:15) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis did not disagree with regard to the limbs of a sin offering that were intermingled with the limbs of a burnt offering,</b> as all agree <b>that they shall be sacrificed.</b> Likewise, they agree that if limbs that are fit to be burned on the altar became intermingled <b>with</b> the limbs of <b>an animal that</b> actively <b>copulated with a person, or</b> with the limbs of <b>an animal that was the object of bestiality,</b> which are prohibited to be sacrificed upon the altar, <b>that they shall not be sacrificed,</b> even according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. |
| Tosefta 8:18 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra138b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:18): If there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: I have one hundred dinars</b> owed to me <b>by so-and-so, the witnesses</b> that hear this <b>may write</b> his statement in a document <b>even if they do not know</b> whether the statement is true. <b>Therefore, when</b> the person’s heir <b>collects</b> the debt, <b>he must bring proof</b> of the debt, as the document written by these witnesses is not regarded as proof. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The witnesses <b>may not write</b> the document <b>unless they know</b> for a fact that the statement is true. <b>Therefore, when</b> the heir <b>collects</b> the debt, <b>he need not bring proof</b> other than the document written by the witnesses, as it has the status of a promissory note. |
| Tosefta 8:18 | hear | Chullin 123a:12 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the opinion of Rabbi Asi from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:18): In the case of <b>one who flays a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually pure</b> animal <b>or a ritually impure</b> unslaughtered carcass, <b>a small animal or a large animal,</b> if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping</b> it, <b>and</b> one who touches <b>one handbreadth</b> of the flayed hide <b>next to the flesh</b> remains <b>pure,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Asi. |
| Tosefta 8:19 | hear | Chullin 123b:9 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of Rabba bar Avuh’s explanation of the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:19): <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>one who flays creeping animals,</b> its hide is considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh, and it imparts impurity of a creeping animal <b>until he flays</b> the animal in <b>its entirety.</b> |
| Tosefta 8:22 | Abaye raised an objection to | Zevachim 75a:1 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> this from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:22): With regard to <b>the offering of an individual that was intermingled with</b> another <b>offering of an individual, and</b> likewise <b>a communal offering that was intermingled with</b> another <b>communal offering, or the offering of an individual and a communal offering that were intermingled with each other,</b> the priest <b>places four placements</b> of blood <b>from each and every one</b> of them on the altar, and in this manner fulfills the obligation of the blood rites of all the offerings. <b>But if he placed</b> one <b>placement from each one,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>if he placed four</b> placements <b>from all of them</b> together, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. |
| Tosefta 8:27 | It was taught | Bava Metzia101b:15 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> For <b>a baker’s shop or a dyer’s shop,</b> one must give <b>three years’</b> notice. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:27): The need for this unusually long period of notice is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the length of the <b>credit</b> extended by these businesses to their customers <b>is extensive.</b> They must be provided with enough time to collect their debts before being forced to relocate. |
| Tosefta 9:1 | Rabbi Oshaya taught | Bava Kamma4b:5 | § Contrary to the mishna, where four primary categories of damage were enumerated, <b>Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1) that there are <b>thirteen primary categories of damage.</b> The thirteen categories consist of four bailees, five types of indemnity, and the four primary categories listed in the mishna. The four bailees are: The <b>unpaid bailee,</b> who is liable for damage caused by his negligence; <b>and the borrower,</b> who is liable for all damage; the <b>paid bailee, and the renter,</b> who is liable if the object is lost or stolen. The five types of indemnity one is liable to pay for injuring another person are: <b>Damage,</b> i.e., the decrease in the injured party’s value; <b>pain; and medical costs; loss of livelihood; and humiliation</b> that the injured party suffered from the assault. <b>And</b> with <b>the four</b> primary categories enumerated in <b>the mishna, that</b> is a total of <b>thirteen.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:1 | As it is taught | Gittin 83a:17 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>With regard to</b> a case where a man <b>divorces his wife and said to her</b> while handing her the bill of divorce: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man except for so-and-so, and she went and married someone from the</b> general <b>public and was</b> subsequently <b>widowed or divorced</b> from him, <b>Rabbi Eliezer concedes that she is</b> now <b>permitted to</b> marry the man <b>whom she was</b> initially <b>prohibited</b> from marrying by the qualification of her first husband. |
| Tosefta 9:1 | The Sages taught | Gittin 83a:4 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>After the death of Rabbi Eliezer, four Sages entered</b> the discussion <b>to refute his statement. They were: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, Rabbi Tarfon, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:1 | And let them be silenced. Isn’t it taught | Sanhedrin 32b:12 | <b>Ulla said to him: But</b> by confronting the witnesses in this manner, <b>we silence them.</b> The witnesses will think that the court suspects them of lying, and they will not testify. Rav Yehuda said to him: <b>And let them be silenced. Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Eliezer says:</b> In cases of capital law, the court <b>brings the witnesses from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place in order to confuse them so that they will retract</b> their testimony if they are lying. |
| Tosefta 9:2 | as it is taught | Bava Batra52b:4 | <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav and this</b> is the opinion of <b>Shmuel; this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabba and this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet. In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does</b> the <b>Master hold?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I know a <i>baraita</i>,</b> which is the source of my opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:2): In a case where there was <b>one of the brothers who was engaging in commerce in the house,</b> managing the family finances, <b>and there were bills of sale and</b> other <b>documents circulating with his name</b> appearing as the owner of the property or as a lender, <b>and</b> that brother <b>said:</b> The money and property <b>are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>mother,</b> who is not the mother of the other brothers, it is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> of ownership. |
| Tosefta 9:2 | as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. The Sages taught | Bava Kamma85b:8 | § The mishna teaches: How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:2): How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. And if you say:</b> But <b>the standard of justice was compromised.</b> The Gemara interjects to clarify this statement of the <i>baraita</i>: It appears to be compromised, <b>as when this man will recover, he</b> will <b>not collect the wage of a watchman of cucumbers,</b> but <b>rather</b> he will <b>carry buckets and collect</b> a higher <b>wage, or</b> he will <b>travel as an agent and collect</b> an even higher <b>wage.</b> The assessment of loss of livelihood should also account for one of these types of labor. |
| Tosefta 9:3 | hear | Bava Kamma91a:13 | The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): With regard to the <b>five types of indemnity</b> that one who injures another must pay, the court <b>evaluates</b> the victim as to the value of the damage that he suffered, <b>and</b> the assailant <b>gives</b> this payment <b>to him immediately.</b> Payment for <b>medical costs and loss of livelihood</b> is evaluated from the moment of injury <b>until he is healed.</b> If the court <b>evaluated</b> that a certain sum would be needed to pay for <b>his</b> medical costs and loss of livelihood, <b>and</b> subsequently the victim’s condition began <b>progressively deteriorating</b> and the sum proved to be inadequate, <b>they give him</b> payment <b>only as they had evaluated him.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:3 | That day and no more? But isn’t it taught | Sanhedrin 42a:9 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And afterward they bring in</b> the second witness and examine him. Later, the mishna states: But if one of the students said: I can teach a reason to acquit him, they raise him to the seat of the court and seat him among them, and he would not descend from there all day. The Gemara asks: <b>That day and no more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): <b>If</b> the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>has substance he would never descend from there,</b> as his statement demonstrates that he is capable of deliberating with the other judges. <b>But if</b> the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>does not have substance, he would not descend from there the entire day, in order that his ascent should not be a descent for him,</b> i.e., to avoid humiliating him. <b>Abaye said: Interpret</b> the mishna to be <b>with regard to</b> a case when the <b>statement of</b> that student <b>does not have substance.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:3 | It is taught | Sanhedrin 52b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to the Rabbis: I too, know that it is a degrading death, but what shall I do, as the Torah states: “And you shall not follow their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3), i.e., it is prohibited to adopt the practices of the gentiles. |
| Tosefta 9:4 | that which is taught | Bava Batra141a:8 | § The mishna discusses a case where one stipulated that if his wife gives birth to a male the offspring shall receive one hundred dinars, and if she gives birth to a female the offspring shall receive two hundred dinars. The mishna states that if she gave birth to both a male and a female, the male receives one hundred dinars and the female receives two hundred. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:4): If she <b>gave birth to a male and a female, the male receives six dinars</b> of gold, which are equivalent to one hundred fifty dinars of silver, <b>and the female receives two dinars</b> of gold, equivalent to fifty dinars of silver, <b>with what</b> situation is this <i>baraita</i> dealing? |
| Tosefta 9:4 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma85a:8 | § The mishna teaches: How is payment for <b>medical costs</b> assessed? If one <b>struck</b> another, then he is <b>liable to heal him</b> by paying for his medical costs. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:4): If <b>growths appeared on</b> the injured area <b>due to the injury, and the wound reopened,</b> then the one who caused the injury is again <b>liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and is liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood</b> while he recovers from the reopened wound. But if the growths that appeared <b>are not due to the injury, he is not liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and he is not liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:5 | as it is taught | Bava Batra141b:1 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:5): In a case where one said: <b>Whoever informs me</b> as <b>to what opened my wife’s womb,</b> i.e., what the sex of her child is, <b>if</b> it is <b>a male,</b> the one who informs me <b>shall receive one hundred dinars.</b> Therefore, if the wife <b>gave birth to a male,</b> the one who informed him <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> If he also said: <b>If</b> it is <b>a female</b> he shall receive <b>one hundred dinars,</b> if <b>she gave birth to a female,</b> he <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> If <b>she gave birth to a male and a female, he</b> receives <b>only one hundred dinars.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:6 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra138a:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:6): If <b>a person on his deathbed said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and three hundred to so-and-so, and four hundred to so-and-so,</b> in this case one <b>does not say</b> that <b>whoever appears first in the deed acquires</b> his money first. <b>Therefore,</b> if <b>a promissory note emerged against</b> the one who gave the gifts, and it becomes clear that the money given was pledged to a creditor, then the creditor <b>collects from all of them.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:9 | Isn’t it taught | Gittin 87a:2 | <b>Rabbi Abba objects to this: According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that when there is <b>one date</b> written <b>for all of them that is a general wording, we should be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps when the witnesses signed</b> the bill of divorce <b>they</b> intended to <b>sign for</b> only <b>the last</b> couple. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:9) that if <b>witnesses are signed on a greeting</b> that was written <b>in a bill of divorce,</b> i.e., after the formulation of the bill of divorce the scribe extended greetings to someone and the witnesses signed underneath, it is <b>invalid,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they signed</b> the <b>greeting</b> and not the bill of divorce? |
| Tosefta 9:12 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma86b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:12): If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>naked,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>naked is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>clothed,</b> since one who chooses to be naked is less sensitive to humiliation. Similarly, if one <b>humiliated</b> another <b>in a bathhouse,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him in a bathhouse is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him in the marketplace.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:13 | As it is taught | Gittin 36a:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:13): <b>At first,</b> the witness <b>would write</b> only: <b>I, so-and-so, signed</b> as <b>a witness,</b> but they did not state their full names. Therefore, the only way to identify the witness was to see if an identical signature could be found on a different document that had been ratified in court. Therefore, <b>if</b> another copy of a witness’s <b>signature is produced from elsewhere,</b> i.e., another court document, it is <b>valid, but if not,</b> then the bill of divorce is <b>invalid</b> even though it is possible that he was a valid witness, and as a result of this women were left unable to remarry. |
| Tosefta 9:17 | raises an objection | Bava Batra60b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:17): <b>One may not plaster, and one may not tile, and one may not paint [<i>mefayyeḥin</i>]</b> images <b>in the present,</b> as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. But if one <b>purchased a courtyard</b> that was <b>plastered, tiled,</b> or <b>painted</b> with images, <b>this</b> courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> and it is assumed that it was done in a permitted manner. If <b>it</b> then <b>fell, he may not return and build it</b> in its previous form. This indicates that one may not rebuild a building in a manner that is prohibited, even if there was an acquired privilege to maintain it in that manner. |
| Tosefta 9:22 | that which is taught | Bava Kamma89b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the reason she does not sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to obtain money with which to pay the injured party is that she would then forgive the debt of the marriage contract, then with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:22): <b>And similarly,</b> in a case where <b>she</b> was the one <b>who injured her husband she has not lost her marriage contract</b> as a result, as he does not collect compensation from the properties she brought into the marriage that are enumerated in the marriage contract, <b>why</b> does she not lose it? <b>Let her sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to her husband</b> in order to obtain the money to compensate him <b>for that injury</b> that she caused him, <b>as, if she will forgive</b> the debt of her marriage contract <b>with regard to her husband there will be no loss</b> for the purchaser, i.e., her husband. |
| Tosefta 9:25 | a dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it is taught | Bava Kamma26b:4 | <b>With regard to</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> whose tooth was destroyed or eye was blinded by the stone, potentially enabling the slave to earn his freedom (see Exodus 21:26–27), this is the subject of <b>a dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:25): <b>If the master was a doctor and</b> the slave <b>said to him: Paint</b> the lid of <b>my eye</b> in order to heal it, <b>and</b> the master <b>blinded it</b> during the procedure, or if the slave requested from his master: <b>Scrape my tooth</b> in order to heal it, <b>and</b> the master <b>knocked out</b> the tooth while scraping it, the slave <b>has mocked the master, as he is emancipated</b> due to the act of the master himself. |
| Tosefta 9:26 | hear | Bava Kamma91a:11 | The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:26): If a slave owner <b>struck</b> his Canaanite slave <b>on his eye and blinded him,</b> or <b>on his ear and deafened him, the slave is emancipated by means of these</b> wounds. If he struck <b>near his eye and</b> as a result <b>he does not see,</b> or <b>near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these</b> wounds. <b>What is the reason</b> that the slave is not emancipated? <b>Isn’t it due to</b> the fact <b>that we require an evaluation</b> of the damage, and in such a case the assumption is that the owner’s action did not suffice to cause the injury? <b>And learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is an evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage.</b> |
| Tosefta 9:26 | Rava raises an objection | Bava Kamma98a:6 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:26): If a master <b>struck</b> his slave <b>on his eye and blinded it,</b> or <b>on his ear and deafened it, the slave is emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. If he struck the slave <b>near his eye and</b> as a result <b>he does not see,</b> or <b>near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. The first clause indicates that one is liable for damage caused even if it is not visible damage. |
| Tosefta 10:2 | As it is taught | Bava Kamma94a:6 | The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:2) that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated this principle:</b> With regard to <b>any enhancement</b> to the stolen animal in <b>that</b> it <b>was enhanced</b> by the actions of the <b>robber, he has the advantage</b> when repaying the owner. If <b>he desires, he takes his enhancement,</b> i.e., when he returns the animal, the robbery victim must pay the difference between its value at the time of the robbery and its current value, and <b>if he desires</b> he can return it to the owner and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you.</b> |
| Tosefta 10:5 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra144b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught: This service</b> mentioned in the mishna is referring <b>to</b> forced <b>imperial service,</b> but if one of the brothers engaged in a trade of his own volition, the profits are his alone. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:5): In the case of <b>one of the brothers who was appointed</b> as <b>a tax collector or a military commander [<i>polmustos</i>],</b> a position with the potential for profit, <b>if</b> he was appointed <b>on account of</b> all <b>the brothers,</b> as the procedure was to impress a representative from each family for this purpose, any profit accrues <b>to</b> all <b>the brothers. If</b> he was appointed <b>on account of himself,</b> the profit accrues <b>to himself.</b> |
| Tosefta 10:8 | collectible in court. The Sages taught | Bava Batra145a:15 | § The mishna teaches: If the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated after the father’s death, they are reciprocated to the middle, <b>because gifts of groomsmen are</b> a legal debt owed to the father, <b>collectible in court. The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:8): <b>Five statements were said with regard to gifts of groomsmen:</b> They are <b>collectible in court; and</b> they are <b>reciprocated</b> only <b>at their</b> relevant <b>time,</b> i.e., at the time of the groomsman’s own wedding; <b>and they are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>interest,</b> i.e., it is permitted to reciprocate with a gift of greater value than the original gift; |
| Tosefta 10:8 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma101a:2 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:8): With regard to <b>one who gives wood to a carpenter to fashion a chair from it and he fashioned a bench from it</b> instead, or one who gives him wood to fashion <b>a bench and he fashioned a chair from it</b> instead, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The carpenter <b>gives him the value of his wood</b> and keeps the chair or bench, as he has acquired it due to the change. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He does not acquire the item. Rather, <b>if</b> the value of the wood’s <b>enhancement exceeds the</b> carpenter’s <b>expenses</b> the owner <b>gives</b> the carpenter <b>the expenses, and if the expenses exceed the enhancement</b> of the wood <b>he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b> Since the carpenter deviated from the customer’s order, he is entitled to either his expenses or the enhancement, the smaller amount of the two. |
| Tosefta 10:9 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra145b:6 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:9): If one <b>served</b> as groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>at a public [<i>pumbei</i>]</b> wedding, <b>and</b> when the groomsman himself wed, he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him at a private</b> wedding, the friend <b>can say to him: I</b> am willing to reciprocate and <b>serve</b> as groomsman <b>for you</b> only <b>at a public</b> wedding, where the rejoicing is greater, <b>in the manner you served</b> as a groomsman <b>for me.</b> If one <b>served</b> as a groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>when</b> he married <b>a virgin, and</b> he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him when</b> he marries <b>a widow,</b> the friend <b>can say to him: I shall serve</b> as a groomsman <b>for you</b> only <b>when</b> you marry <b>a virgin, in the manner you served</b> as a groomsman <b>for me.</b> |
| Tosefta 10:15 | taught | Sanhedrin 13b:9 | § The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:15): The <b>laying of hands and</b> the <b>laying of hands by the Sages</b> are performed <b>by three</b> judges. <b>What</b> is the <b>laying of hands, and what</b> is the <b>laying of hands by the Sages?</b> It is clear that one of these terms is referring to the elders laying their hands on the bull offered for an unwitting communal sin, but what is the meaning of the other expression? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is referring to the <b>ordination of elders,</b> meaning, to appoint Sages and grant them the title Rabbi. |
| Tosefta 10:15 | is taught | Zevachim 96b:6 | Rav Yitzḥak bar Yehuda <b>said to him: Are</b> the situations <b>comparable? Blood does not spread</b> and penetrate all parts of the garment, but in the case of <b>cooking,</b> the flavor of the meat <b>spreads</b> throughout the entire vessel. <b>Additionally,</b> your reasoning opposes that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:15): A certain <b>stringency</b> applies <b>to sprinkling</b> more <b>than</b> it applies to <b>scouring and rinsing; and</b> a certain <b>stringency</b> applies <b>to scouring and rinsing</b> more <b>than</b> it applies to <b>sprinkling.</b> |
| Tosefta 10:16 | As it is taught | Bava Kamma109a:5 | Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:16) that the verse states with regard to one who steals from one who then died: <b>“But if the man has no kinsman</b> to whom <b>restitution may be made for the guilt,</b> the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” (Numbers 5:8). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But is there</b> any <b>Jewish person who has no kinsmen?</b> Since every Jew descends from Jacob our forefather, all Jews have relatives to inherit from them. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert</b> who never married or had children as a Jew, and in any case is no longer legally related to his gentile family; he has no heirs. In this situation the Torah instructs one who robbed from a now-deceased convert to return the stolen item to a priest. |
| Tosefta 10:18 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma111a:2 | § The mishna teaches: If the robber <b>gave the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib</b> and then gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, the following priestly watch, to sacrifice on his behalf, he has fulfilled his obligation. By contrast, if he first gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Joiarib and then gave the money to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, if the guilt-offering is extant, then members of the priestly watch of Jedaiah, who received the money, should sacrifice it. The Gemara quotes a <i>baraita</i> that records a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i> concerning this case. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:18): If the robber <b>gave the guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib and</b> then gave <b>the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> they <b>should return the money</b> to be <b>with the guilt-offering,</b> i.e., with the priestly watch of Joiarib; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say</b> the opposite: They <b>should return the guilt-offering</b> to be <b>with the money,</b> and the priestly watch of Jedaiah will sacrifice it. |
| Tosefta 10:18 | It is taught | Bava Kamma111a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> on this topic (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:18): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that if during the Joiarib watch the robber gave the guilt-offering to the Joiarib watch and the money to the Jedaiah watch, the money should return to the priestly watch of Joiarib, <b>if the members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib went first and sacrificed the guilt-offering</b> before receiving the money from the priestly watch of Jedaiah, then the robber <b>should go back and bring another guilt-offering, and the members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> who are already in possession of the money, <b>should offer it, and those</b> members of the priestly watch of Joiarib <b>acquired that</b> offering <b>that is in their possession.</b> |
| Tosefta 10:21 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma112a:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:21): With regard to <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his children,</b> the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the owner. In a case where <b>he left</b> the stolen items <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, if the heirs are <b>adults they are obligated to pay,</b> and if they are <b>minors they are exempt from paying. If the adult</b> heirs <b>said: We do not know</b> what <b>calculations our father made with you</b> and whether he paid you for the stolen goods, <b>they are exempt.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:1 | said to him: As it is taught | Bava Batra162a:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Amram: From where do you</b> know <b>this?</b> Rav Amram <b>said to him: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:1): If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines from the text</b> of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <b>not valid,</b> as it would be possible for the holder of the document to fill in false information in those lines. But if one distanced the signatures <b>one line</b> from the text, the document is <b>valid.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:2 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra165b:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:2): If a document <b>states</b> that someone owes <b>silver,</b> without specifying which silver coin, the amount must be <b>no less than a silver dinar.</b> If it states: <b>Silver dinars, or: Dinars silver,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two silver dinars,</b> the lowest amount to which that phrase can refer. If it states: <b>Silver, in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>silver.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:3 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 89a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:3): <b>One does not execute</b> the rebellious elder, <b>neither in the court that is in his city, nor in the court that is in Yavne. Rather, one takes him up to the High Court that is in Jerusalem. And they guard him</b> in incarceration <b>until the pilgrimage Festival, and</b> the court <b>executes him during the pilgrimage Festival, as it is stated: “And all the nation shall hear, and fear”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:4 | The Sages taught | Bava Batra166b:2 | § The mishna teaches: If it is <b>written</b> in the document <b>above</b> that someone owes one hundred dinars, and below it is written two hundred dinars, or if above it is written two hundred and below one hundred, everything follows the bottom amount. If so, why does one write the information in the upper part of the document at all? It is a safety measure, so that if one letter is erased from the lower part of the document, thereby rendering it illegible, the information can be learned from the upper part of the document. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:4): Information concerning what is written <b>below may be learned from</b> what is written <b>above</b> if the lower text is missing <b>one letter, but not</b> if it is missing <b>two letters.</b> In that case, in the event of a discrepancy between information written above and information written below, the document is not valid. |
| Tosefta 11:5 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119a:18 | § The mishna teaches: <b>But one may purchase</b> specific goods <b>from women</b> in certain places. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:5): <b>One may purchase from women woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, but not wines, oils, and flours,</b> as these are not usually sold by women and there is a concern that perhaps the women stole them from their husbands. <b>And no</b> items may be purchased <b>from slaves, or from children. Abba Shaul says: A woman may sell</b> items <b>for</b> up to <b>four and five dinars in order to make a cap [<i>kippa</i>] for her head,</b> as it is assumed that her husband allows her to sell these items in order to purchase additional articles of clothing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> cases, <b>where they told</b> the buyer <b>to conceal</b> his purchase, it is <b>prohibited</b> to enter into the transaction. |
| Tosefta 11:7 | as the Master said | Sotah 12b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Moses was placed in the water <b>on the sixth of Sivan, you find</b> that there can be <b>three months</b> during which Moses was hidden after his birth; <b>as the Master said</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:7): Moses <b>died on the seventh of Adar, and Moses was born on the seventh of Adar. And</b> based on this, <b>from the seventh of Adar until the sixth of Sivan</b> there are <b>three months,</b> which correspond to the three months Moses was hidden before being placed in the water. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that it was <b>on the twenty-first of Nisan, how can you find</b> that he was hidden for three months? |
| Tosefta 11:8 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119a:3 | The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which discusses purchasing items from watchmen: <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:8): With regard to <b>produce watchmen, one may purchase</b> produce <b>from them when they are sitting and selling</b> the produce, <b>and the baskets are before them and the scales [<i>veturtanei</i>] are before them,</b> as in these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that they are not selling stolen merchandise. <b>But</b> in <b>all</b> cases <b>where they said</b> to the buyer: <b>Conceal</b> your purchase, it is <b>prohibited</b> to purchase from them, as there is good reason to suspect that the merchandise is stolen. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>One may purchase from</b> a watchman <b>from the entrance of the garden, but not from the back of the garden,</b> because if the produce is being sold inconspicuously, there is a concern that it might have been stolen. |
| Tosefta 11:8 | Rabbi Yehuda? As it is taught | Bava Metzia118b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:8): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: When it is</b> the <b>time</b> for the <b>manure</b> to be <b>taken out, a person</b> may <b>take his manure out into the public domain and</b> may <b>pile it</b> up for <b>all thirty days, so that it will be trodden on by the feet of people and by the feet of animals,</b> to prepare it for use as fertilizer, <b>since</b> it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua bequeathed Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b> In other words, it is universally accepted that some will relinquish certain rights for the sake of others, and although it may be a nuisance for certain people, this practice is allowed. |
| Tosefta 11:9 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma118b:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:9): <b>One may purchase from shepherds neither goats, nor kids, nor fleeces, nor torn</b> pieces <b>of wool, but one may purchase sewn</b> garments <b>from them, because they are</b> presumed to be <b>theirs. And one may purchase milk and cheese from them in an unsettled area, but not in a settled area.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:10 | as it is taught | Bava Batra162b:3 | <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:10): If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines from the text</b> of the document, the document is <b>not valid,</b> but if the gap is <b>less than that,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that any gap less than two full lines does not invalidate the document. |
| Tosefta 11:10 | taught | Sotah 36a:8 | It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:10): The <b>hornet [<i>tzira</i>] did not cross</b> the Jordan <b>with them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did it <b>not? But isn’t it written: “And I will send the hornet before you,</b> which shall drive out the Hivites, and the Canaanites” (Exodus 23:28)? |
| Tosefta 11:11 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119b:7 | § Apropos the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to weaving, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that discusses which items may be purchased from various craftsmen. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:11): <b>One may purchase from a weaver neither</b> woolen <b>wads [<i>irin</i>],</b> which are used to hold the bobbin in place on a shuttle, <b>nor heddles [<i>nirin</i>], nor threads of the bobbin [<i>punkalin</i>], nor remnants of</b> coils of thread that were left on the <b>spool,</b> as there is a concern that these items were taken from the customer without his consent. |
| Tosefta 11:12 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119b:6 | § The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that discusses which items may be purchased from a carder. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:12): <b>One may not purchase strands</b> of thread <b>from a carder, because</b> it is assumed that <b>they are not his. And in a place where</b> the residents <b>were accustomed</b> to allow carders to retain strands, the strands may be presumed <b>to be his</b> and <b>one may purchase</b> them. <b>And in every place, one may purchase from them a cushion full of</b> stuffing made from <b>strands, or a mattress full of</b> stuffing made from <b>strands. What is the reason</b> that it is permitted? The reason is that even if the carder had stolen the strands, once he uses them to make a cushion or mattress, <b>he has acquired</b> them <b>through a change</b> of form. |
| Tosefta 11:13 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119a:24 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:13): <b>One may purchase strands</b> of wool <b>from a launderer, because they are</b> assumed to be <b>his. A launderer may take the two upper threads</b> of a garment, <b>and they are his.</b> |
| Tosefta 11:15 | raises an objection | Bava Batra174b:4 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:15): <b>A guarantor</b> for a debt <b>who has the promissory note</b> for that debt <b>in his possession,</b> indicating that he has repaid the debt, and now seeks reimbursement from the debtor, <b>cannot collect</b> if the debtor has died and the obligation for the debt has fallen to his minor heirs. <b>But if it is written</b> by the creditor <b>in</b> the promissory note: <b>I received</b> repayment <b>from you,</b> the guarantor, then the guarantor <b>can collect</b> the debt from the minor heirs. |
| Tosefta 11:16 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119b:11 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:16): In the case of <b>one who gives hides to a tanner, the trimmings</b> of hide <b>and the detached</b> hairs <b>belong to the customer, but</b> the substance that <b>comes up</b> while being <b>washed in water belongs to him,</b> the tanner. |
| Tosefta 11:18 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma119b:19 | The mishna teaches: <b>And if he was doing</b> his work <b>in</b> the domain of the customer, then even the sawdust belongs to the customer. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:18): <b>Stone chiselers are not in</b> violation of a transgression <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery</b> if they take the leftover chips of rock. Furthermore, with regard to <b>those who prune trees, those who prune vines, those who trim shrubs, those who weed plants, and those who hoe vegetables,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the owner’s inclination: <b>When the owner is particular about</b> the plant trimmings, the workers <b>are in</b> violation of a transgression <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery</b> if they take the trimmings, but if <b>the owner is not particular about them,</b> then <b>these</b> items <b>belong to</b> the workers. |
| Tosefta 13:2 | hear | Sotah 48b:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:2) with regard to when the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> ceased: <b>From</b> the time <b>when the First Temple was destroyed, the cities with fields</b> that were allocated to the Levites <b>were nullified, and the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> ceased, and the monarchy ceased from the house of David.</b> |
| Tosefta 13:3 | As the Sages taught | Sotah 48b:6 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Who</b> are <b>the early prophets,</b> with regard to whom it states that use of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> ceased immediately after their death? This term early prophets serves <b>to exclude Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,</b> who <b>are</b> the <b>latter prophets.</b> The <i>Urim VeTummim</i> was used throughout the First Temple period, up to, but not including, their time. <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:3): <b>From</b> the time <b>when Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi died the Divine Spirit departed from the Jewish people,</b> as these three were considered to be the last prophets. <b>And</b> even after the Urim VeTummim ceased to exist, they would <b>nevertheless</b> still <b>make use of a Divine Voice</b> to receive instructions from Above, even after this time. |
| Tosefta 13:5 | And are the ministering angels not familiar with the Aramaic language? But isn’t it taught | Sotah 33a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are the ministering angels not familiar with the Aramaic language? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:5): <b>Yoḥanan the High Priest heard a Divine Voice</b> emerging <b>from the House of the Holy of Holies that was saying: The youth who went to wage war in Antokhya have been victorious. And</b> there was <b>another incident involving Shimon HaTzaddik, who heard a Divine Voice</b> emerging <b>from the House of the Holy of Holies that was saying: The decree that the enemy intended to bring against the Temple is annulled, and Gaskalgas,</b> Caligula, <b>has been killed and his decrees have been voided. And</b> people <b>wrote</b> down <b>that time</b> that the Divine Voice was heard, <b>and</b> later found that it <b>matched</b> exactly the moment that Caligula was killed. The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> this Divine Voice <b>was speaking in the Aramaic language.</b> |
| Tosefta 13:9 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 109b:12 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:9): The members of <b>the assembly of Korah have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the earth closed upon them”</b> (Numbers 16:33), meaning <b>in this world,</b> and also: <b>“And they perished from among the assembly”</b> (Numbers 16:33), meaning <b>in the World-to-Come;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> Although it says that they perished, <b>they are like a lost item that is sought,</b> ultimately found, and rehabilitated, <b>as it is stated: “I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek out your servant, for I do not forget your mitzvot”</b> (Psalms 119:176). |
| Tosefta 13:9 | was taught in a baraita | Sotah 48a:9 | A different explanation of strikers <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:9): They are those <b>who would beat</b> the calf <b>with sticks,</b> to stun it before it was slaughtered, <b>in the manner that they do it before idols.</b> Yoḥanan the High Priest <b>said to them: Until when will you feed unslaughtered animal carcasses to the altar?</b> The Gemara asks: Are these animal carcasses actually <b>unslaughtered animal carcasses? They were slaughtered,</b> i.e., they did not die of their own accord. <b>Rather,</b> he said that the beatings would cause them to become <b>like animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>],</b> as <b>perhaps</b> these beatings will <b>perforate the membrane surrounding the brain,</b> which would make the calf a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>He</b> therefore <b>arose and instituted an ordinance for them</b> to put <b>rings in the ground</b> with which they could secure the animals, thereby making it easier to slaughter the animals without having to scratch them between the horns or hit them with sticks. |
| Tosefta 13:10 | But isn’t it taught | Sotah 48a:3 | The Gemara poses a question: The fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan canceled the declaration of tithes proves <b>by inference that they would separate</b> tithes in his days. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:10): <b>He,</b> Yoḥanan the High Priest, <b>also canceled the declaration</b> of tithes <b>and decreed with regard to doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>]?</b> Why did he issue this decree? <b>Because he sent</b> messengers <b>throughout</b> the land, to <b>all the borders of</b> Eretz <b>Yisrael</b> to investigate, <b>and saw that they would separate only <i>teruma gedola</i>, and</b> as for <b>first tithe and second tithe, some</b> people <b>would tithe and some</b> people <b>would not tithe.</b> |
| Tosefta 13:12 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 110b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:12): <b>The ten tribes have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation;</b> and He cast them into another land, as it is this day” (Deuteronomy 29:27). <b>“And the Lord rooted them out of their land”</b> indicates <b>in this world; “and cast them into another land”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of the village of Akko says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: If their actions</b> continue to be <b>“as it is this day”</b> and they continue to sin, <b>they do not return</b> to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And if not,</b> and they repent, <b>they return</b> to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Tosefta 14:1 | is taught | Sanhedrin 16b:16 | The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 14:1) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The court <b>may not designate three</b> adjoining <b>cities</b> as <b>idolatrous</b> cities <b>in Eretz Yisrael, but they may designate two, such as one in Judea and one in the Galilee. But they may not designate two in Judea or two in the Galilee. And</b> if the city is <b>near the frontier, they may not designate even one. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Perhaps the gentiles will hear</b> that there is a city on the border that is desolate, <b>and they will</b> seize the opportunity to invade and <b>destroy Eretz Yisrael.</b> |
| Tosefta 14:5 | in it must be redeemed. The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 112b:1 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And the consecrated</b> property <b>in it must be redeemed. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 14:5): <b>If there were offerings of the most sacred order in it,</b> if they were animals <b>consecrated for</b> sacrifice on <b>the altar, they shall die;</b> one causes their death. Items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance must be redeemed, and <i>terumot</i> must</b> be left to <b>decay, and second tithe and sacred scrolls must be interred. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> That is not so; rather, the term: <b>“Its animals”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16), serves to <b>exclude a firstborn animal and</b> animal <b>tithe,</b> as they never belonged to the idolatrous city. The term: <b>“Its spoils”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), serves to <b>exclude consecrated money and tithe money.</b> |
