| Ketubot 4:4 | raises an objection | Ketubot 48b:8 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 4:4): If <b>the father went with the husband’s messengers, or</b> if <b>the father’s messengers went with the husband’s messengers, or</b> if <b>she owned a courtyard along the way and she entered with</b> her groom <b>to lodge,</b> not for the purpose of marriage but merely to stay overnight until they arrive at his residence, then <b>even if</b> the dowry specified in <b>her marriage contract is</b> already <b>in her husband’s house,</b> if <b>she dies, her father inherits</b> from <b>her,</b> as she is not considered to have entered her husband’s domain. |
| Ketubot 5:1 | taught | Ketubot 57b:5 | § <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It was <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 5:1) with regard to <b>a minor girl: Either she or her father may delay</b> the wedding until she has reached majority. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, she,</b> the girl herself, <b>may delay</b> the wedding if she feels she is not ready, as she is the one who will be directly affected, <b>but</b> why should <b>her father</b> be allowed to delay her wedding? <b>If it is suitable for her</b> to get married, <b>what difference does it make to her father?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He thinks:</b> Perhaps she agrees to get married <b>now</b> because <b>she does not</b> fully <b>know</b> what she is doing. But <b>tomorrow, she will</b> realize the marriage was a mistake, <b>rebel, and leave</b> her husband, <b>and</b> then <b>she will come</b> back <b>and become</b> a burden <b>to me.</b> Therefore, her father prefers that she wait until she has reached majority and marry when she is completely aware of what is involved. |
| Ketubot 12:3 | The Sages taught | Bava Kamma8a:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 12:3): If one owes money to pay damages, repay a loan, and pay a woman’s marriage contract, and he owns inferior-quality, intermediate-quality, and superior-quality land, and he sells all of his land, then if he <b>sold</b> all of the land <b>to one</b> person <b>or to three people simultaneously, all</b> the buyers <b>replace the</b> land’s prior <b>owner</b> with regard to repayment of his debts. At the time when each debt was created, each creditor gained a lien on the plots of the debtor’s land, from which they have a right to collect. As a lien remains in effect even if the land is sold, then even after the sale, each creditor can collect from the plots of land upon which they have a lien. Accordingly, damages are collected from the superior-quality land, the loan is repaid from the intermediate-quality land, and the marriage contract is paid from the inferior-quality land. |
| Ketubot 12:3 | Rav Sheshet raised an objection | Ketubot 104a:18 | <b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, based upon the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 12:3): <b>A creditor may collect</b> the money he is owed even after a long time has passed <b>without</b> his having <b>mentioned</b> the debt. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If he does not hold the document</b> that records the debt, <b>with what is he collecting</b> the debt? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he does hold the document.</b> It can be inferred that even so, it is specifically <b>a creditor, who</b> it could be assumed <b>is not one</b> to have <b>forgiven</b> his debt, who may continue to collect the debt after a long period of time. <b>But a widow</b> is presumed to have <b>waived</b> her rights to the payment of her marriage contract even if she has the marriage contract in her possession. This conclusion contradicts the statement of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei. |
| Ketubot 87:9 | taught | Ketubot 75a:7 | § The mishna teaches that <b>all blemishes that disqualify</b> priests disqualify women’s betrothal as well. The Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 87:9): <b>To these, they added</b> several additional blemishes applying only to women: <b>Sweat, a mole, and</b> a foul <b>odor from the mouth.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>And</b> do <b>these</b> blemishes <b>not</b> also <b>disqualify priests? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to blemishes of animals (<i>Bekhorot</i> 41a): <b>The old, the sick, and the filthy? And it was taught</b> in a different mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 43a): <b>These blemishes</b> stated concerning animals, <b>whether</b> they are <b>permanent</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>temporary,</b> render <b>people,</b> i.e., priests, <b>disqualified</b> as well. This shows that filth and sweat disqualify priests too. |
