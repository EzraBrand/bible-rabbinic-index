| Genesis 1:1 | the Sages taught: Beit Shammai say: The heavens were created first and afterward the earth was created, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” | Chagigah 12a:16 | § Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel dispute the order of Creation, as <b>the Sages taught: Beit Shammai say: The heavens were created first and afterward the earth was created, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1), which indicates that heaven came first. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>earth was created first, and heaven after it, as it is stated: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven”</b> (Genesis 2:4). |
| Genesis 1:1 | et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz | Chagigah 12a:20 | § The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Akiva</b> a question <b>when they were walking along the way. He said to him: You who served Naḥum of Gam Zu for twenty-two years, who would expound</b> and learn that <b>every</b> appearance of the word <b><i>et</i> in the Torah</b> is meant to teach something, <b>what would he expound from</b> the phrase: <b>“The heaven and the earth”</b> [<b><i>et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz</i></b>] (Genesis 1:1)? <b>He said to him:</b> These words should be expounded as follows: <b>Had it stated:</b> In the beginning God created <i>hashamayim veha’aretz</i>, i.e., the heaven and the earth, without the word <i>et</i>, <b>I would have said: <i>Shamayim</i> is the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> and the same goes for <i>aretz</i>, and the verse would sound as if it meant that God, whose name is <i>Shamayim</i> and <i>Aretz</i>, created the world. <b>Since it states “<i>et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz</i>,”</b> it is clear that these are created objects and that <b><i>shamayim</i></b> means the <b>actual heaven</b> and <b><i>aretz</i></b> is the <b>actual earth.</b> It is for this reason that the word <i>et</i> is necessary. |
| Genesis 1:1 | Heaven and earth, as it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” | Chagigah 12a:6 | All of these are derived from the Torah: <b>Heaven and earth, as it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). <b><i>Tohu</i> and <i>vohu</i>, as it is written: “And the earth was unformed and void [<i>tohu vavohu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>Light and darkness; darkness, as it is written: “And darkness was upon the face of the deep”</b> (Genesis 1:2); <b>light, as it is written: “And God said: Let there be light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). <b>Wind and water, as it is written: “And the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>The length of day and the length of night, as it is written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). |
| Genesis 1:1 | “In the beginning” | Megillah 21b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are these</b> ten utterances? Presumably, they are the utterances introduced by the words <b>“and</b> God <b>said”</b> in the story of Creation in the first chapter of <b>Genesis.</b> However, <b>there are</b> only <b>nine of these</b> utterances and not ten. The Gemara answers: The expression: <b>“In the beginning”</b> (Genesis 1:1) <b>is also</b> considered <b>an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth”</b> (Psalms 33:6), which indicates that the first utterance of Creation was the general creation of the entire universe. |
| Genesis 1:1 | And they wrote for him: God created in the beginning [ bereshit ], | Megillah 9a:12 | <b>And they wrote for him: God created in the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>],</b> reversing the order of the words in the first phrase in the Torah that could be misinterpreted as: “<i>Bereshit</i> created God” (Genesis 1:1). They did so to negate those who believe in the preexistence of the world and those who maintain that there are two powers in the world: One is <i>Bereshit</i>, who created the second, God. And they wrote: <b>I shall make man in image and in likeness,</b> rather than: “Let us make man in our image and in our likeness” (Genesis 1:26), as from there too one could mistakenly conclude that there are multiple powers and that God has human form. |
| Genesis 1:1 | “In the beginning [ bereshit ]” | Sukkah 49a:2 | § <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The drainpipes [<i>shittin</i>]</b> built into the altar and extending beneath it <b>were created from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “The hidden of your thighs are like the links of a chain, the handiwork of a skilled workman”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2). The Gemara interprets the verse homiletically: <b>“The hidden of your thighs”; these are the drainpipes</b> that are concealed within the altar; <b>“are like the links of a chain [<i>ḥala’im</i>]”; they are hollow [<i>meḥolalin</i>] and descend to the depths; “the handiwork of a skilled workman”; this is the handiwork of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> On a similar note, <b>it was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that it is written: <b>“In the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:1); <b>do not read</b> it as: <b><i>Bereshit</i>, but rather as: <i>Bara shit</i>,</b> meaning that God created the pipeline descending from the altar. |
| Genesis 1:1 | heavens were created first, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” | Tamid 32a:3 | Alexander continued to ask questions of the Elders of the Negev. <b>He said to them:</b> Were the <b>heavens created first or</b> was <b>the earth</b> created first? <b>They said:</b> The <b>heavens were created first, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). |
| Genesis 1:2 | “And the spirit [ ruaḥ ] of God hovered over the face of the waters” | Avodah Zarah29a:5 | This remedy is beneficial for several ailments, and the Gemara presents each of these in turn: <b>For</b> curing the <b>heart,</b> the above combination should be taken <b>with wine, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). <b>For</b> curing an ailment that arises due to <b>the wind [<i>ruḥa</i>],</b> one drinks the mixture <b>in water, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And the spirit [<i>ruaḥ</i>] of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>For childbirth [<i>lekhuda</i>],</b> a woman in labor drinks the mixture <b>with beer [<i>shikhra</i>], and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“With her pitcher [<i>vekhadah</i>] upon her shoulder [<i>shikhmah</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:15). |
| Genesis 1:2 | Tohu and vohu , as it is written: “And the earth was unformed and void [ tohu vavohu ]” | Chagigah 12a:6 | All of these are derived from the Torah: <b>Heaven and earth, as it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). <b><i>Tohu</i> and <i>vohu</i>, as it is written: “And the earth was unformed and void [<i>tohu vavohu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>Light and darkness; darkness, as it is written: “And darkness was upon the face of the deep”</b> (Genesis 1:2); <b>light, as it is written: “And God said: Let there be light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). <b>Wind and water, as it is written: “And the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>The length of day and the length of night, as it is written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). |
| Genesis 1:2 | “And the earth was unformed and void” | Chagigah 12b:1 | <b>Why do I</b> need <b>“and the earth” [<i>et ha’aretz</i>]? To</b> teach that <b>heaven preceded earth</b> in the order of Creation. The next verse states: <b>“And the earth was unformed and void”</b> (Genesis 1:2). The Gemara asks: <b>After all,</b> the Bible <b>began with heaven first; what is different</b> about the second verse? Why does the Bible <b>recount the creation of earth</b> first in the second verse? <b>The Sage of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> This can be explained by <b>a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who said to his servants: Rise early</b> and come <b>to my entrance. He arose and found women and men</b> waiting for him. <b>Whom does he praise? Those who are unaccustomed to rising early but</b> yet <b>rose early,</b> the women. The same applies to the earth: Since it is a lowly, physical sphere, we would not have expected it to be created together with heaven. Therefore, it is fitting to discuss it at greater length. |
| Genesis 1:2 | a mere three fingers between them, as it is stated: “And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters” | Chagigah 15a:3 | With regard to the fate of ben Zoma, <b>the Sages taught: There was once an incident with regard to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, who was standing on a step on the Temple Mount, and ben Zoma saw him and did not stand before him</b> to honor him, as he was deep in thought. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: From where</b> do you come <b>and where are you going, ben Zoma,</b> i.e., what is on your mind? <b>He said to him:</b> In my thoughts <b>I was looking upon</b> the act of Creation, at the gap <b>between the upper waters and the lower waters, as there is only</b> the breadth of <b>a mere three fingers between them, as it is stated: “And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2), <b>like a dove hovering over its young without touching</b> them. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students</b> who had overheard this exchange: <b>Ben Zoma is still outside;</b> he has not yet achieved full understanding of these matters. |
| Genesis 1:2 | darkness was created first, as it is written: “Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness | Tamid 32a:4 | <b>He said to them:</b> Was the <b>light created first, or</b> was the <b>darkness</b> created first? <b>They said to him: This matter has no solution,</b> as the verses do not indicate an answer. The Gemara asks: <b>But let them say to him</b> that the <b>darkness was created first, as it is written: “Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness</b> was upon the face of the deep” (Genesis 1:2), <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> does it state: <b>“And God said: Let there be light. And there was light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). Why did they not say that the darkness was created first? |
| Genesis 1:3 | light, as it is written: “And God said: Let there be light” | Chagigah 12a:6 | All of these are derived from the Torah: <b>Heaven and earth, as it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). <b><i>Tohu</i> and <i>vohu</i>, as it is written: “And the earth was unformed and void [<i>tohu vavohu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>Light and darkness; darkness, as it is written: “And darkness was upon the face of the deep”</b> (Genesis 1:2); <b>light, as it is written: “And God said: Let there be light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). <b>Wind and water, as it is written: “And the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>The length of day and the length of night, as it is written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). |
| Genesis 1:3 | “And God said: Let there be light. And there was light” | Tamid 32a:4 | <b>He said to them:</b> Was the <b>light created first, or</b> was the <b>darkness</b> created first? <b>They said to him: This matter has no solution,</b> as the verses do not indicate an answer. The Gemara asks: <b>But let them say to him</b> that the <b>darkness was created first, as it is written: “Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness</b> was upon the face of the deep” (Genesis 1:2), <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> does it state: <b>“And God said: Let there be light. And there was light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). Why did they not say that the darkness was created first? |
| Genesis 1:4 | “And God saw that the light | Bava Kamma55a:6 | <b>Rather,</b> it is not merely because it is the first letter of the word good [<i>tov</i>] that it is considered a good omen. <b>Since the Torah initially introduces</b> the letter <i>tet</i> in a context <b>of good,</b> with the word good [<i>tov</i>] itself, it is a good omen. <b>As from</b> the word <b><i>bereshit</i>,</b> the first word in the Torah, <b>until</b> the verse: <b>“And God saw that the light</b> was good [<i>tov</i>]” (Genesis 1:4), the letter <b><i>tet</i> is not written</b> anywhere. |
| Genesis 1:4 | And for whom did He conceal it? For the righteous people in the future, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good” | Chagigah 12a:10 | <b>And for whom did He conceal it? For the righteous people in the future, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), <b>and “good” is referring to none</b> other than the <b>righteous, as it is stated: “Say</b> of <b>the righteous that it shall be good</b> for them, for they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). |
| Genesis 1:4 | with “it is good” | Pesachim 2a:3 | To clarify the meaning of the word <i>or</i>, the Gemara analyzes biblical verses and rabbinic statements. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a verse: <b>“As soon as the morning was <i>or</i>, the men were sent away,</b> they and their donkeys” (Genesis 44:3). <b>Apparently, <i>or</i> is day.</b> The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Is it written: The light was morning? “The morning was light” is written.</b> In this context, <i>or</i> is a verb not a noun, <b>as the one who said:</b> The <b>morning lightened. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person</b> should <b>always enter</b> an unfamiliar city <b>with “it is good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), i.e., before sunset, while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to light upon its creation. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he</b> should <b>leave with “it is good,”</b> meaning after sunrise the next morning. |
| Genesis 1:4 | it is written here: “And when she saw him that he was a goodly [ tov ] child,” and it is written there: “And God saw the light, that it was good [ tov ]” | Sotah 12a:17 | The verse states with regard to the birth of Moses: “And the woman conceived, and bore a son; <b>and when she saw him that he was a goodly [<i>tov</i>] child,</b> she hid him three months” (Exodus 2:2). It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: “Tov” is his,</b> Moses’, real <b>name,</b> as it was given to him by his parents when he was born. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: His name was Toviya. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> They said he was good because they saw that he was <b>fit for prophecy. Others say:</b> They said he was good because he was <b>born when he was</b> already <b>circumcised. And the Rabbis say: At the time when Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And when she saw him that he was a goodly [<i>tov</i>] child,” and it is written there: “And God saw the light, that it was good [<i>tov</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:4). |
| Genesis 1:4 | with “it is good” | Taanit 10b:11 | The Gemara further explains: <b>And bring the sun into the city,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person</b> should <b>always leave</b> the place where he has spent the night <b>with “it is good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), i.e., after sunrise, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to the creation of light. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one comes into an unfamiliar city <b>he</b> should <b>enter with “it is good,”</b> before sunset, <b>as it is stated: “As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away”</b> (Genesis 44:3). |
| Genesis 1:4 | world is created, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good” | Yoma 38b:11 | Conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous, as it is written: “And the men of Sodom were</b> exceedingly <b>wicked and sinful to God”</b> (Genesis 13:13), after which it is written: <b>“And God said to Abram, after that Lot had separated from him”</b> (Genesis 13:14); God proceeds to bless him. And <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Even for one righteous</b> person an entire <b>world is created, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), <b>and good means nothing other than righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous that he is good”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). |
| Genesis 1:5 | one day, as it is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” | Berakhot 26a:17 | On the topic of one who forgot to pray and seeks to compensate for the prayer that he missed, <b>a dilemma was raised before them</b> in the study hall: <b>One who erred and did not recite the afternoon prayer, what is</b> the ruling? May he <b>recite</b> in <b>the evening prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers? The Gemara articulates the sides of the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that <b>one who erred and did not pray the evening prayer prays in the morning prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers, perhaps that is <b>because</b> the evening and the morning are both part of <b>one day, as it is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5); the evening and the following morning constitute a single unit. <b>But here,</b> in the case under discussion, perhaps <b>prayer is in place of sacrifice.</b> Since in the case of sacrifice we say, <b>since its day passed, its sacrifice is invalid</b> and there is no way to compensate for the missed opportunity, the same should be true for prayer. <b>Or, perhaps, since prayer is supplication, any time that one wishes, he may continue to pray?</b> |
| Genesis 1:5 | “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day” | Berakhot 2a:9 | However, there is another possible explanation for why the mishna opens with the evening <i>Shema</i> rather than with the morning <i>Shema</i>. <b>If you wish,</b> you could <b>say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> the precedence of the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>from the</b> order of the <b>creation of the world. As it is written</b> in the story of creation: <b>“And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). According to this verse, day begins with the evening and not the morning. For both of these reasons it was appropriate to open the discussion of the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> with the evening <i>Shema</i>. |
| Genesis 1:5 | The length of day and the length of night, as it is written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day” | Chagigah 12a:6 | All of these are derived from the Torah: <b>Heaven and earth, as it is written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). <b><i>Tohu</i> and <i>vohu</i>, as it is written: “And the earth was unformed and void [<i>tohu vavohu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>Light and darkness; darkness, as it is written: “And darkness was upon the face of the deep”</b> (Genesis 1:2); <b>light, as it is written: “And God said: Let there be light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). <b>Wind and water, as it is written: “And the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>The length of day and the length of night, as it is written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). |
| Genesis 1:5 | It is stated in the act of Creation: “One day” | Chullin 83a:15 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b> Therefore, one may slaughter an animal during the day and slaughter its offspring that night, but one may not slaughter an animal at night and slaughter its offspring the following day. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma derived this</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated in the act of Creation: “One day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), <b>and it is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring: “One day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28). <b>Just as</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated in the act of Creation, the day follows the night, so too</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b> |
| Genesis 1:5 | And isn’t it written: “And it was [ vayhi ] evening, and it was [ vayhi ] morning, one day” | Megillah 10b:10 | The Gemara cites additional verses where <i>vayhi</i> is not indicative of impending grief: <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the four hundred and eightieth year”</b> (I Kings 6:1), which discusses the joyous occasion of the building of the Temple? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] when Jacob saw Rachel”</b> (Genesis 29:10), which was a momentous occasion? <b>And isn’t it written: “And it was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening, and it was [<i>vayhi</i>] morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5)? <b>And isn’t there the second</b> day of Creation, <b>and isn’t there the third</b> day, where the term <i>vayhi</i> is used? <b>And aren’t there many</b> verses in the Bible in which the term <i>vayhi</i> appears and no grief ensues? Apparently, the proposed principle is incorrect. |
| Genesis 1:5 | morning, one day” | Megillah 10b:8 | After citing several verses where <i>vayhi</i> portends grief, the Gemara mentions a number of verses that seem to indicate otherwise. <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day”</b> (Leviticus 9:1), which was the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that day: <b>On that day there was joy before the Holy One, Blessed be He, similar to</b> the joy that existed on the <b>day on which the heavens and earth were created.</b> The Gemara cites a verbal analogy in support of this statement. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day,” and it is written there,</b> in the Creation story: <b>“And it was [<i>vayhi</i>]</b> evening, and it was <b>morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). This indicates that there was joy on the eighth day, when the Tabernacle was dedicated, similar to the joy that existed on the day the world was created. Apparently, the term <i>vayhi</i> is not necessarily a portent of grief. |
| Genesis 1:5 | day” | Megillah 20b:2 | § The mishna concludes: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> things, <b>if one did them after daybreak they are valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived, that from daybreak it is already considered daytime? <b>Rava said: As the verse states: “And God called the light</b> [or] <b>day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), meaning: <b>To that which was becoming lighter and lighter he called day.</b> The Hebrew word <i>or</i> is not to be understood in its usual sense of light, but as a verbal noun: that which is becoming lighter and lighter. It teaches that as soon as light begins to appear in the sky it is called daytime. |
| Genesis 1:5 | He called night” | Megillah 20b:3 | The Gemara raises a difficulty with this interpretation: <b>However, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rava’s interpretation of this phrase is correct, the following phrase: <b>“And the darkness</b> [<b><i>ḥoshekh</i></b>] <b>He called night”</b> (Genesis 1:5), should be interpreted in a similar fashion: <b>That which was becoming darker and darker He called night,</b> so that immediately after sunset it would be considered nighttime. But don’t <b>we maintain</b> that <b>until the stars come out it is not nighttime?</b> We are forced to say that <i>ḥoshekh</i> literally means darkness, and similarly, <i>or</i> in the first part of the verse literally means light. |
| Genesis 1:5 | Also with regard to days, isn’t it written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” | Nazir 7a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Also with regard to days, isn’t it written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), which indicates that each day is a separate unit? Consequently, one who vows to be a nazirite: From here until such and such a place, should be considered to have accepted upon himself distinct terms of naziriteship corresponding to the number of days it takes to travel to the designated destination. |
| Genesis 1:5 | raises an objection: “And God called the or Day, | Pesachim 2a:5 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection: “And God called the <i>or</i> Day,</b> and the darkness He called Night” (Genesis 1:5). <b>Apparently, <i>or</i> is day.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof as well. <b>This is</b> what the verse <b>is saying:</b> God <b>called the advancing light Day.</b> As stated previously, the word <i>or</i> can also be a verb; in this context, God called the beginning of that which eventually brightens, Day. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>However, if</b> that <b>is so,</b> the continuation of the verse, <b>“and the darkness He called Night,”</b> should be understood to mean: <b>He called the advancing darkness Night,</b> even before it is actually dark. However, this cannot be the correct interpretation of the verse, <b>as we maintain it is day until the emergence of the stars.</b> Since the stars emerge only after the sky begins to darken, the advancing evening cannot be defined as part of the night. |
| Genesis 1:5 | “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” | Pesachim 88a:5 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The day of the <b>ingathering of exiles is as great as the day on which heaven and earth were created.</b> This is derived by means of a verbal analogy between the word day in these two contexts, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning the ingathering of exiles: <b>“And the children of Judea and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel”</b> (Hosea 2:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the narrative of Creation: <b>“And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). |
| Genesis 1:5 | “And it was evening and it was morning, one day” | Shabbat 10a:5 | Speaking of judgment, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi would sit and study between the pillars</b> beneath the study hall. <b>And each and every hour they would knock on the bolt of the door and say: If there is</b> someone <b>who</b> has a case that <b>requires judgment, let him enter and come</b> before us. The Gemara also relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit in judgment all day and their hearts would grow weak</b> from hunger. Therefore, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav from Difti taught them</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And it was the next day and Moses sat to judge the people <b>and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening”</b> (Exodus 18:13). <b>Does it enter your mind that Moses would sit and judge all day long?</b> If so, <b>when was his Torah</b> study <b>accomplished? Rather,</b> surely the verse is coming <b>to tell you: Any judge who judges a true judgment truthfully, even if</b> he sits in judgment only <b>one hour, the verse ascribes to him as if he became a partner to the Holy One, Blessed be He, in the act of Creation,</b> as by means of a true judgment he upholds the world (<i>Me’iri</i>). This conclusion is derived by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>]: <b>It is written here: “And the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening.” And it is written there,</b> in the act of Creation: <b>“And it was evening and it was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). The evening and part of the morning are considered a whole day. With regard to this issue as well, it is sufficient for the judges to sit in judgment for only part of the day and there is no need for them to starve themselves by sitting in judgment all day. |
| Genesis 1:6 | occurred on the second day, as it is written: “And let it divide the waters from the waters” | Chagigah 15a:4 | The Gemara explains: <b>Now,</b> this verse: <b>“And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters,” when was</b> it stated? <b>On the first day,</b> whereas <b>the division</b> of the waters <b>occurred on the second day, as it is written: “And let it divide the waters from the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:6). How, then, could ben Zoma derive a proof from the former verse? The Gemara asks: <b>And how much,</b> in fact, is the gap between them? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Like the thickness of a thread; and the Rabbis said: Like</b> the gap between <b>the boards of a bridge. Mar Zutra, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Asi, said: Like two robes spread one over the other,</b> with a slight gap in between. <b>And some said: Like two cups placed one upon the other.</b> |
| Genesis 1:10 | and the gathering together of the waters [ mikve ] He called seas” | Shabbat 109a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>this</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits bathing in the Great Sea, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who deems all seas equal. <b>That</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits bathing there, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the Great Sea is unlike other seas. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All seas</b> purify <b>like a ritual bath [<i>mikve</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And God called the dry land earth, <b>and the gathering together of the waters [<i>mikve</i>] He called seas”</b> (Genesis 1:10); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Only <b>the Great Sea</b> purifies <b>like a ritual bath, and</b> the verse <b>states seas only</b> because <b>there are many seas in</b> the Great Sea, not because all seas purify. |
| Genesis 1:11 | after its kind” | Chullin 60a:10 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works”</b> (Psalms 104:31). <b>This verse was stated by the minister of the world,</b> i.e., the angel charged with overseeing the world. <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> “Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree bearing fruit <b>after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11), <b>the grasses drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves.</b> |
| Genesis 1:11 | Tishrei? As it is stated: “And God said: Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind” | Rosh Hashanah11a:3 | The Gemara explains these matters in detail: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei? As it is stated: “And God said: Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11). <b>Which is the month in which the earth brings forth grass and the trees are full of</b> ripe <b>fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Tishrei.</b> And a further proof that the world was created in Tishrei is that when the world was first created, it needed rain so that the plants would grow, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Tishrei <b>is a time of rain, and rain fell and</b> the plants <b>grew, as it is stated: “But there went up a mist from the earth,</b> and watered the whole face of the ground” (Genesis 2:6). |
| Genesis 1:12 | emerged after its kind, | Chullin 60a:12 | <b>Immediately, every</b> kind of grass <b>emerged after its kind,</b> as it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind” (Genesis 1:12). <b>The minister of the world began</b> to speak <b>and said: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works,”</b> who do His will even when not explicitly instructed. |
| Genesis 1:12 | is written: “And the earth brought forth grass” | Chullin 60b:5 | § <b>Rav Asi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And the earth brought forth grass”</b> (Genesis 1:12), <b>on the third day of the week</b> of Creation. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “No shrub of the field was yet in the earth”</b> (Genesis 2:5), <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> the sixth day of Creation, immediately before Adam was created. Rav Asi explains: This <b>teaches that the grasses emerged</b> on the third day <b>and stood at the opening of the ground,</b> but they did not grow <b>until Adam, the first</b> man, <b>came and prayed for mercy upon them, and rain came, and they sprouted.</b> And this is meant <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.</b> |
| Genesis 1:12 | and tree yielding fruit” | Rosh Hashanah11a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed</b> after its kind, <b>and tree yielding fruit”</b> (Genesis 1:12). <b>Which is the month in which the earth is full of grass and the trees</b> begin to <b>bring forth fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Nisan.</b> And further proof that the world was created in Nisan is that when the world was first created, the animals had to breed in order to fill the world, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Nisan <b>is a time when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows,</b> and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14). |
| Genesis 1:14 | it is impossible that they will not count seasons with it, as it is written: “And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years” | Chullin 60b:3 | <b>She said before Him: Master of the Universe, since I said a correct</b> observation <b>before You,</b> must <b>I diminish myself?</b> God <b>said to her:</b> As compensation, <b>go and rule</b> both <b>during the day</b> along with the sun <b>and during the night. She said to Him: What is the greatness of</b> shining alongside the sun? <b>What use is a candle in the middle of the day?</b> God <b>said to her: Go; let the Jewish people count the days and years with you,</b> and this will be your greatness. <b>She said to Him: But</b> the Jewish people will count with <b>the sun as well,</b> as <b>it is impossible that they will not count seasons with it, as it is written: “And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years”</b> (Genesis 1:14). God said to her: <b>Go; let righteous men be named after you.</b> Just as you are called the lesser [<i>hakatan</i>] light, there will be <b>Ya’akov HaKatan,</b> i.e., Jacob our forefather (see Amos 7:2), <b>Shmuel HaKatan</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and <b>David HaKatan,</b> i.e., King David (see I Samuel 17:14). |
| Genesis 1:16 | is written: “And God made the two great lights” | Chullin 60b:2 | § <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And God made the two great lights”</b> (Genesis 1:16), <b>and</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> in the same verse: <b>“The greater light</b> to rule the day, <b>and the lesser light</b> to rule the night,” indicating that only one was great. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi explains: When God first created the sun and the moon, they were equally bright. Then, <b>the moon said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> is it <b>possible for two kings to serve with one crown?</b> One of us must be subservient to the other. God therefore <b>said to her,</b> i.e., the moon: If so, <b>go and diminish yourself.</b> |
| Genesis 1:17 | light created on the first day? But isn’t it written: “And God set them in the firmament of the heaven” | Chagigah 12a:8 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>And</b> was <b>light created on the first day? But isn’t it written: “And God set them in the firmament of the heaven”</b> (Genesis 1:17), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day”</b> (Genesis 1:19), indicating that light was created on the fourth day. |
| Genesis 1:17 | sun, moon, stars, and zodiac signs are fixed, as it is stated: “And God set them in the firmament [ Rakia ] of the heaven” | Chagigah 12b:5 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> There are <b>seven</b> firmaments, <b>and they are as follows: <i>Vilon</i>, <i>Rakia</i>, <i>Sheḥakim</i>, <i>Zevul</i>, <i>Ma’on</i>, <i>Makhon</i>,</b> and <b><i>Aravot</i>.</b> The Gemara proceeds to explain the role of each firmament: <b><i>Vilon</i>,</b> curtain, is the firmament that <b>does not contain anything, but enters at morning and departs</b> in the <b>evening, and renews the act of Creation daily, as it is stated: “Who stretches out the heavens as a curtain [<i>Vilon</i>], and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in”</b> (Isaiah 40:22). <b><i>Rakia</i>,</b> firmament, is the one <b>in which</b> the <b>sun, moon, stars, and zodiac signs are fixed, as it is stated: “And God set them in the firmament [<i>Rakia</i>] of the heaven”</b> (Genesis 1:17). <b><i>Sheḥakim</i>,</b> heights, is the one <b>in which mills stand and grind manna for the righteous, as it is stated: “And He commanded the heights [<i>Sheḥakim</i>] above, and opened the doors of heaven; and He caused manna to rain upon them for food,</b> and gave them of the corn of heaven” (Psalms 78:23–24). |
| Genesis 1:19 | written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day” | Chagigah 12a:8 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>And</b> was <b>light created on the first day? But isn’t it written: “And God set them in the firmament of the heaven”</b> (Genesis 1:17), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day”</b> (Genesis 1:19), indicating that light was created on the fourth day. |
| Genesis 1:20 | One verse states: “And God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creeping animals, and birds will fly” | Chullin 27b:11 | The Gemara relates an excerpt of an exchange between a Roman government official and Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai. <b>And furthermore,</b> the official <b>asked</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>One verse states: “And God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creeping animals, and birds will fly”</b> (Genesis 1:20); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the water. And it is written: “And from the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the air</b> and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them” (Genesis 2:19); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the land.</b> |
| Genesis 1:21 | “And God created the great sea monsters” | Bava Batra74b:5 | The verse states: <b>“And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21). <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> this as a reference to the <b>sea oryx. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent, as it is stated: “In that day the Lord with His sore</b> and great and strong <b>sword</b> will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent” (Isaiah 27:1). |
| Genesis 1:21 | “According to its species [ leminehu ]” | Bava Kamma55a:12 | In connection with the prohibition of diverse kinds, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> One <b>who crossbreeds two species</b> of creatures <b>that</b> live <b>in the sea is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition of crossbreeding diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., where is there an allusion to this in the Torah? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said in the name of Ulla:</b> It <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:21), referring to animals living <b>on dry land,</b> and the same term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:25), referring to sea creatures. In the same way that the former may not be crossbred, similarly, the latter may not be crossbred. |
| Genesis 1:21 | man. As it is stated: “And God created the great sea monsters” | Niddah 22b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item with <b>the form of a sea monster, its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since</b> the concept of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> its creation, <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man. As it is stated: “And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21). |
| Genesis 1:25 | “According to its species [ leminehu ]” | Bava Kamma55a:12 | In connection with the prohibition of diverse kinds, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> One <b>who crossbreeds two species</b> of creatures <b>that</b> live <b>in the sea is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition of crossbreeding diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., where is there an allusion to this in the Torah? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said in the name of Ulla:</b> It <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:21), referring to animals living <b>on dry land,</b> and the same term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:25), referring to sea creatures.

| Genesis 1:25 | that it is written: “And God made the animals of the earth | Niddah 22b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that the term “and…formed” that appears <b>with regard to animals</b> is considered <b>free? If we say</b> it is due to the fact <b>that it is written: “And God made the animals of the earth</b> after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> similarly <b>written: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field”</b> (Genesis 2:19), and therefore this verse is superfluous, but <b>with regard to</b> the <b>sea monster as well,</b> the expression “and…created” is <b>free, as it is written:</b> “And God made…<b>and everything that creeps on the ground</b> after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And God created the great sea monsters.”</b> Consequently, the term “and…created” is also free on both sides of the verbal analogy. |
| Genesis 1:26 | I shall make man in image and in likeness, | Megillah 9a:12 | <b>And they wrote for him: God created in the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>],</b> reversing the order of the words in the first phrase in the Torah that could be misinterpreted as: “<i>Bereshit</i> created God” (Genesis 1:1). They did so to negate those who believe in the preexistence of the world and those who maintain that there are two powers in the world: One is <i>Bereshit</i>, who created the second, God. And they wrote: <b>I shall make man in image and in likeness,</b> rather than: “Let us make man in our image and in our likeness” (Genesis 1:26), as from there too one could mistakenly conclude that there are multiple powers and that God has human form. |
| Genesis 1:26 | “Let us make man in our image” | Sanhedrin 38b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any place</b> in the Bible from <b>where the heretics</b> attempt to <b>prove their heresy,</b> i.e., that there is more than one god, <b>the response to their</b> claim is <b>alongside them,</b> i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the verses they cite. The verse states that God said: <b>“Let us make man in our image”</b> (Genesis 1:26), employing the plural, <b>but it</b> then <b>states: “And God created man in His image”</b> (Genesis 1:27), employing the singular. The verse states that God said: <b>“Come, let us go down and there confound their language”</b> (Genesis 11:7), but it also states: <b>“And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower”</b> (Genesis 11:5). The verse states in the plural: <b>“There God was revealed [<i>niglu</i>] to him</b> when he fled from the face of his brother” (Genesis 35:7), but it also states in the singular: <b>“To God Who answers [<i>haoneh</i>] me in the day of my distress”</b> (Genesis 35:3). |
| Genesis 1:27 | for in the image of God He created him” | Eruvin 18a:23 | The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,”</b> in the plural, <b>and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written:</b> “So God created man in His own image, <b>for in the image of God He created him”</b> (Genesis 1:27), in the singular. <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 1:27 | it is written: “And God created man in His own image” | Ketubot 8a:9 | The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it was</b> only <b>one act of creation.</b> However, one <b>Sage holds:</b> It is <b>according to</b> the initial <b>thought</b> that <b>we proceed. And</b> one <b>Sage holds:</b> It is <b>according to</b> the <b>action</b> that <b>we proceed.</b> God’s initial thought was to create man and woman as separate entities. Ultimately, they were created as one entity. That explanation is <b>like the following. Rav Yehuda raises a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “And God created man in His own image”</b> (Genesis 1:27), indicating one act of creation, <b>and</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “Male and female He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2), indicating two acts. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> apparent contradiction be resolved? <b>Initially, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, but ultimately only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 1:27 | creation, as it is written: “And God created man in His own image” | Niddah 22b:17 | <b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharges an item similar to a sea monster, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated, can be <b>derived</b> by a different verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of human offspring, since here it also states <b>creation, as it is written: “And God created man in His own image”</b> (Genesis 1:27). |
| Genesis 1:27 | states: “And God created man in His image” | Sanhedrin 38b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any place</b> in the Bible from <b>where the heretics</b> attempt to <b>prove their heresy,</b> i.e., that there is more than one god, <b>the response to their</b> claim is <b>alongside them,</b> i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the verses they cite.

| Genesis 1:27 | created” | Sanhedrin 39a:7 | <b>The emperor said to Rabban Gamliel: He Who created mountains did not create wind,</b> rather two separate gods created them, <b>as it is stated: “For, lo, He forms mountains and creates wind”</b> (Amos 4:13); one is described with the verb “forms,” and the other with the verb “creates.” Rabban Gamliel said to him: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to Adam, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“And</b> God <b>created”</b> (Genesis 1:27), and also: <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed”</b> (Genesis 2:7), <b>so too</b> should one say that <b>He who created this did not create that?</b> |
| Genesis 1:28 | Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish | Gittin 43b:5 | § <b>Rav Huna bar Ketina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one woman who was a half-maidservant half-free woman, and they forced her master</b> to emancipate her, <b>and he made her a free woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says: For both</b> Adam and Eve the verse <b>states: “And God blessed them, and</b> God <b>said</b> to them: <b>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish</b> the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28), indicating that the mitzva to procreate is incumbent upon women as well, and therefore a half-maidservant half-free woman must be freed to enable her to procreate? |
| Genesis 1:28 | procreation | Kiddushin 34a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> this an established <b>principle?</b> But <b>there are</b> the mitzvot of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> on the first night of Passover (Exodus 23:15), of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival (Deuteronomy 16:9–11), and <b>assembly</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). <b>And</b> each of these is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are obligated</b> in them. <b>And furthermore,</b> one can raise a difficulty as follows: <b>But there are</b> the mitzvot of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7), <b>procreation</b> (Genesis 1:28), <b>and redemption of the firstborn</b> (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which <b>is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are exempt</b> from them. |
| Genesis 1:28 | Be fruitful and multiply, | Kiddushin 35a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says</b> that <b>with regard to both of them,</b> men and women, the verse <b>states: “And God blessed them,</b> and God said to them: <b>Be fruitful and multiply,</b> replenish the earth and conquer it” (Genesis 1:28), <b>what can be said?</b> According to his opinion, women are exempt from only one positive mitzva that is not time bound, Torah study; why not derive other mitzvot from this case? The Gemara answers: The reason this is not a difficulty is <b>because Torah study and the redemption of the firstborn son,</b> from which women are also exempt, <b>are two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent. |
| Genesis 1:28 | and conquer it” | Kiddushin 35a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka as well, let procreation,</b> which he maintains applies to women, <b>and fear</b> of one’s mother and father <b>be</b> considered <b>two verses that come as one and</b> they should <b>not teach</b> a precedent. The Gemara answers: Both cases <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only that women are obligated in <b>fear</b> of their parents, <b>and had not written</b> that they are obligated in <b>procreation, I would say</b> that as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth <b>and conquer it”</b> (Genesis 1:28), this leads to the conclusion that women are exempt from procreation, by the following reasoning: <b>As</b> it is <b>the manner of a man</b> to go to war and <b>to conquer, yes,</b> he is obligated in procreation, but <b>as it is not the manner of a woman to conquer,</b> she is <b>not</b> obligated in procreation. |
| Genesis 1:28 | “And have dominion over the fish of the sea, | Sanhedrin 59b:16 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the assertion that eating meat was prohibited to Adam, from the verse: <b>“And have dominion over the fish of the sea,</b> and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creeps upon the land” (Genesis 1:28). <b>What, is it not</b> stated <b>with regard to consumption,</b> i.e., doesn’t this verse mean that people may eat the meat of animals? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse is referring <b>to</b> using animals for <b>labor.</b> |
| Genesis 1:28 | said to them: Be fruitful and multiply | Shabbat 111a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> with regard to remedies that restore procreative ability: <b>These have restored me to my youth?</b> Apparently, even an elderly man can procreate with the proper remedy. <b>Rather,</b> the remedy for jaundice was discussed with regard <b>to a woman,</b> who is not commanded to reproduce. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who <b>said:</b> The mitzva is incumbent <b>on both of them,</b> the man and the woman, as <b>it states: “And God blessed them and</b> God <b>said to them: Be fruitful and multiply</b> and fill the earth and conquer it” (Genesis 1:28), <b>what is there to say?</b> How could a woman use this remedy? In his opinion a woman is also commanded to procreate. The Gemara answers: In his opinion, this remedy may be used for <b>an elderly woman or, alternatively, for a barren woman.</b> He would agree that there is no prohibition to cause infertility in a woman who cannot conceive. |
| Genesis 1:28 | states with regard to both of them: “And God blessed them, and God said to them: Be fruitful and multiply” | Yevamot 65b:3 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man is commanded with regard to</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply, but not a woman. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that a woman is also commanded, as the verse <b>states with regard to both of them: “And God blessed them, and God said to them: Be fruitful and multiply”</b> (Genesis 1:28). |
| Genesis 1:28 | and fill the land and conquer it” | Yevamot 65b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that a woman is not obligated in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? <b>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: The verse states:</b> “Be fruitful and multiply, <b>and fill the land and conquer it”</b> (Genesis 1:28). <b>It is the manner of a man to conquer and it is not the manner of a woman to conquer.</b> Consequently, it is evident that the entire command, including the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, was given only to men and not to women. |
| Genesis 1:31 | which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day” | Avodah Zarah3a:6 | The nations <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> in this matter the <b>testimony of heaven and earth is</b> tainted by <b>a conflict of interest, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). <b>And</b> concerning this verse, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the acts of Creation, and said: If the Jewish people accept My Torah</b> at the revelation at Sinai, all is <b>well, but if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder.</b> |
| Genesis 1:31 | which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day” | Avodah Zarah5a:12 | The Gemara answers: These passages were written <b>conditionally,</b> i.e., if the Jewish people were to sin and not become like angels, those <i>halakhot</i> would take effect. The Gemara asks: <b>And are verses written conditionally</b> in this manner? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the acts of Creation, and He said: If the Jewish people accept the Torah</b> at the revelation at Sinai, all is <b>well</b> and the world will continue to exist. <b>But if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder.</b> |
| Genesis 1:31 | sixth day, as it is stated: “And God saw all that He had done and behold, it was very good” | Pesachim 54a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And was its fire created on Shabbat eve? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The fire that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created on the second day of the week will never be extinguished, as it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, nor will their fire be extinguished;</b> and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24)? <b>And Rabbi Bana’a, son</b> of <b>Rabbi Ulla, said: Why doesn’t the verse state: That it was good,</b> at the end of the <b>second day of the week</b> of Creation, as it does on the other days? It is <b>because on</b> that day <b>the fire of Gehenna was created. And Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>even though: That it was good, was not stated with regard to</b> the creations of the second day, <b>He later included it</b> on the <b>sixth day, as it is stated: “And God saw all that He had done and behold, it was very good”</b> (Genesis 1:31). |
| Genesis 1:31 | which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day” | Shabbat 88a:6 | <b>Ḥizkiya said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was silent”</b> (Psalms 76:9)? <b>If it was afraid, why was it silent; and if it was silent, why was it afraid? Rather,</b> the meaning is: <b>At first, it was afraid, and in the end, it was silent.</b> “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven” refers to the revelation at Sinai. <b>And why was</b> the earth <b>afraid?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? <b>Why do I require the superfluous</b> letter <b><i>heh</i>,</b> the definite article, which does not appear on any of the other days? It <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the act of Creation, and said to them: If Israel accepts the Torah</b> on the sixth day of Sivan, <b>you will exist; and if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder.</b> Therefore, the earth was afraid until the Torah was given to Israel, lest it be returned to a state of chaos.

As it is stated: “And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them” | Chullin 60a:9 | And this <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: All</b> items created during the <b>acts of Creation were created with their</b> full <b>stature,</b> immediately fit to bear fruit; <b>they were created with their</b> full mental <b>capacities; they were created with their</b> full <b>form. As it is stated: “And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them”</b> (Genesis 2:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“The host of them [<i>tzeva’am</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Their form [<i>tzivyonam</i>].</b> |
| Genesis 2:1 | form. As it is stated: “And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their host” | Rosh Hashanah11a:6 | The Gemara continues to ask: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>isn’t it written: “Fruit tree,”</b> indicating that the world was created in a season when the trees were already filled with their fruit? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse may be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All</b> the <b>acts of Creation</b> were created <b>with their</b> full <b>stature,</b> immediately fit to bear fruit; <b>they were created with their</b> full mental <b>capacities; they were created with their</b> full <b>form.

| Genesis 2:4 | earth was created first, and heaven after it, as it is stated: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven” | Chagigah 12a:16 | § Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel dispute the order of Creation, as <b>the Sages taught: Beit Shammai say: The heavens were created first and afterward the earth was created, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1), which indicates that heaven came first. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>earth was created first, and heaven after it, as it is stated: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven”</b> (Genesis 2:4). |
| Genesis 2:4 | states: “These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created [ behibare’am ]” | Menachot 29b:10 | <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:4), <b>do not read</b> it as <b><i>behibare’am</i>,</b> meaning: When they were created; <b>rather,</b> read it as <b><i>beheh bera’am</i>,</b> meaning: He created them with the letter <i>heh</i>. This verse demonstrates that the heaven and the earth, i.e., this world, were created with the letter <i>heh</i>, and therefore the World-to-Come must have been created with the letter <i>yod</i>. |
| Genesis 2:4 | Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: “These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven” | Yoma 54b:5 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: “These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven”</b> (Genesis 2:4) means that the <b>generations of the heavens,</b> i.e., all things found in the heavens, <b>were created from the heavens,</b> while the <b>generations of the earth were created from the earth.</b> |
| Genesis 2:5 | written: “No shrub of the field was yet in the earth” | Chullin 60b:5 | § <b>Rav Asi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And the earth brought forth grass”</b> (Genesis 1:12), <b>on the third day of the week</b> of Creation. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “No shrub of the field was yet in the earth”</b> (Genesis 2:5), <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> the sixth day of Creation, immediately before Adam was created. Rav Asi explains: This <b>teaches that the grasses emerged</b> on the third day <b>and stood at the opening of the ground,</b> but they did not grow <b>until Adam, the first</b> man, <b>came and prayed for mercy upon them, and rain came, and they sprouted.</b> And this is meant <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.</b> |
| Genesis 2:6 | grew, as it is stated: “But there went up a mist from the earth, | Rosh Hashanah11a:3 | The Gemara explains these matters in detail: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei? As it is stated: “And God said: Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11). <b>Which is the month in which the earth brings forth grass and the trees are full of</b> ripe <b>fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Tishrei.</b> And a further proof that the world was created in Tishrei is that when the world was first created, it needed rain so that the plants would grow, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Tishrei <b>is a time of rain, and rain fell and</b> the plants <b>grew, as it is stated: “But there went up a mist from the earth,</b> and watered the whole face of the ground” (Genesis 2:6). |
| Genesis 2:6 | the verse states: “And there went up a mist from the earth, | Sukkah 11b:14 | § We learned in the mishna: <b>This is the principle</b> with regard to the roofing of a <i>sukka</i>: One may not roof the <i>sukka</i> with <b>anything that is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> or whose growth is not from the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> with regard to the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And there went up a mist from the earth,</b> and watered the entire face of the ground” (Genesis 2:6); <b>just as mist,</b> i.e., a cloud, <b>is a substance not capable of contracting ritual impurity, and its growth is from the ground,</b> i.e., arises from the ground, <b>so too,</b> the roofing of the <b><i>sukka</i></b> must consist of <b>a substance</b> that is <b>not susceptible to ritual impurity and its growth is from the ground.</b> Since the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> evokes the clouds of glory with which God enveloped the Israelites in the desert, the legal status of roofing should be like that of a cloud. |
| Genesis 2:6 | As it is stated: “And there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground” | Taanit 9b:10 | § The Gemara discusses the source of rain. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabbi Eliezer says: The entire world drinks from the waters of the ocean [<i>okeyanos</i>],</b> i.e., evaporated ocean water is the source of rain. <b>As it is stated: “And there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground”</b> (Genesis 2:6). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But the waters of the ocean are salty,</b> whereas rainwater is sweet. Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: The waters <b>are sweetened in the clouds,</b> before they fall to the earth. |
| Genesis 2:7 | Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Then the Lord God formed [ vayyitzer ] man” | Berakhot 61a:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda interpreted homiletically: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Then the Lord God formed [<i>vayyitzer</i>] man”</b> (Genesis 2:7), <b>with a double <i>yod</i>?</b> This double <i>yod</i> alludes to that fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, created two inclinations; one a good inclination and one an evil inclination.</b> |
| Genesis 2:7 | the statement of Rabbi Meir. | Chullin 71a:12 | This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara elsewhere (<i>Nidda</i> 22b) explains that Rabbi Meir derives his opinion from the fact that the term “formation” is used to describe both the formation of man: “Then the Lord God formed man” (Genesis 2:7), and the formation of animals and birds: “The Lord God formed every animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] of the field, and every bird of the air” (Genesis 2:19). Furthermore, he holds that the term “<i>ḥayya</i>” is referring to both domesticated and undomesticated animals, and concludes that a woman observes these periods of purity and impurity if the fetus has the form of any of these types of animals. |
| Genesis 2:7 | formed [ vayyitzer ] | Eruvin 18a:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was originally <b>a face</b> or side of Adam; it is understandable <b>that it is written:</b> “Then the Lord God <b>formed [<i>vayyitzer</i>]</b> man” (Genesis 2:7). <i>Vayyitzer</i> is written with <b>a double <i>yod</i>,</b> one for Adam and one for Eve. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> conveyed by spelling <b><i>vayyitzer</i></b> with a double <i>yod</i>? |
| Genesis 2:7 | man: | Niddah 22b:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges a fetus in the form of an animal has the same status as one who discharges a fetus with human form or gives birth to a human? It is <b>since</b> the Torah uses a similar formulation in the two cases, as a term of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> the creation of these types of animals, in the verse: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field, and every fowl of the air” (Genesis 2:19), <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man:</b> “And the Lord God formed man” (Genesis 2:7). |
| Genesis 2:7 | formed” | Sanhedrin 39a:7 | <b>The emperor said to Rabban Gamliel: He Who created mountains did not create wind,</b> rather two separate gods created them, <b>as it is stated: “For, lo, He forms mountains and creates wind”</b> (Amos 4:13); one is described with the verb “forms,” and the other with the verb “creates.” Rabban Gamliel said to him: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to Adam, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“And</b> God <b>created”</b> (Genesis 1:27), and also: <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed”</b> (Genesis 2:7), <b>so too</b> should one say that <b>He who created this did not create that?</b> |
| Genesis 2:7 | as it is written: “And man became a living soul” | Taanit 22b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: An individual is not permitted to afflict himself by fasting, lest</b> he become too weak to work and <b>be beholden to other beings, and</b> those <b>beings will not have mercy on him. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And man became a living soul”</b> (Genesis 2:7). Rabbi Yosei interprets this verse as a command: <b>The soul I placed within you,</b> preserve and <b>sustain it.</b> |
| Genesis 2:8 | as it is written: “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden eastward [ mikedem ]” | Nedarim 39b:7 | <b>The Garden of Eden</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden eastward [<i>mikedem</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:8). “Eastward [<i>mikedem</i>]” is interpreted in the sense of before [<i>mikodem</i>], i.e., before the world was created. |
| Genesis 2:8 | as it is written: “And God planted the Garden of Eden in the east [ mikedem ]” | Pesachim 54a:10 | <b>The Garden of Eden</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “And God planted the Garden of Eden in the east [<i>mikedem</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:8). The term: In the east [<i>mikedem</i>] is interpreted in the sense of: Before [<i>mikodem</i>], i.e., before the world was created. <b>Gehenna</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old”</b> (Isaiah 30:33). The hearth, i.e., Gehenna, was created before the world was created. |
| Genesis 2:10 | the verse states: “And a river went out from Eden to water the Garden” | Berakhot 34b:26 | <b>And lest you will say: It is</b> the <b>Garden and it is Eden;</b> two names describing the same place. That is not the case, as <b>the verse states: “And a river went out from Eden to water the Garden”</b> (Genesis 2:10). Obviously, the <b>Garden</b> exists <b>on its own and Eden</b> exists <b>on its own.</b> |
| Genesis 2:10 | the verse states: “And a river emerged from Eden to irrigate the garden” | Sanhedrin 99a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> reward is indicated in the phrase <b>“no eye has seen it”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: This is wine preserved in its grapes from the six days of Creation.</b> No person has drunk that wine and therefore no one can appreciate its quality. <b>Reish Lakish says: This is Eden,</b> which <b>no eye has ever seen. And if you say: Where did Adam</b> the first man <b>live,</b> if not in Eden, the answer is that he lived <b>in the garden. And lest you say:</b> The <b>garden is Eden</b> and they are indistinguishable, <b>the verse states: “And a river emerged from Eden to irrigate the garden”</b> (Genesis 2:10), indicating that they are two distinct places. |
| Genesis 2:10 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The entire world drinks from the runoff of the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “And a river went out of Eden | Taanit 10a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The entire world drinks from the runoff of the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “And a river went out of Eden</b> to water the garden” (Genesis 2:10). It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the runoff of a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> a field in which a <i>kor</i> of seed can be planted, which is approximately seventy-five thousand square cubits, a field in which <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>tarkav</i>],</b> of seed can be sown, i.e. one-sixtieth the size of a <i>beit kor</i>, <b>can be watered.</b> If the runoff from a <i>beit kor</i> is sufficient for a field one-sixtieth its size, it can be inferred that the rest of the world is one-sixtieth the size of the Garden of Eden. |
| Genesis 2:12 | “And the gold of that land is good” | Yoma 44b:17 | § The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day, it was</b> of <b>greenish gold</b> but on this day it was of a red gold. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: There are seven</b> types <b>of gold</b> mentioned in the Bible: <b>Gold, and good gold, and gold of Ophir</b> (I Kings 10:11), <b>and glistering gold</b> (I Kings 10:18), <b>and <i>shaḥut</i> gold</b> (I Kings 10:17), <b>and closed gold</b> (I Kings 10:21), <b>and <i>parvayim</i> gold</b> (II Chronicles 3:6). The Gemara explains the reason for these names: There is a distinction between <b>gold and good gold, as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And the gold of that land is good”</b> (Genesis 2:12), which indicates the existence of gold of a higher quality. <b>Gold of Ophir</b> is gold <b>that comes from Ophir. Glistering [<i>mufaz</i>] gold</b> is so named |
| Genesis 2:14 | as it is written: “And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goes toward the east of Asshur” | Ketubot 10b:10 | The Gemara asks: That explains the use of <i>almana</i> in the terminology of the Sages. However, with regard to the term <b><i>almana</i> that is written in the Torah, what is there to say?</b> The rabbinic ordinance that the marriage contract of a widow is a <i>maneh</i> was not yet instituted. The Gemara answers: The Torah employs the term <i>almana</i> <b>because the Sages are destined to institute</b> the sum of a <b><i>maneh</i> for her</b> in her marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>And is a verse written for the future?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> indeed it is, <b>as it is written: “And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goes toward the east of Asshur”</b> (Genesis 2:14). <b>And Rav Yosef taught: Asshur, that is Seleucia. And did</b> that city <b>exist</b> when the Torah was written? <b>Rather,</b> the Torah is referring to that city <b>because</b> it was <b>destined</b> to exist in the future. <b>Here too,</b> the Torah employs the term <i>almana</i> <b>because</b> a widow was <b>destined</b> to have a marriage contract of a <i>maneh</i> instituted for her. |
| Genesis 2:16 | it is derived from there: | Sanhedrin 56a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here?</b> Rather, <b>it is derived from there:</b> “And the Lord God commanded the man” (Genesis 2:16), as is stated in a <i>baraita</i> that will soon be quoted at length: <b>“The Lord,” this</b> is referring to <b>the blessing,</b> i.e., cursing, <b>of the name</b> of God. This verse concerns Adam, the first man, and is therefore binding on all of humanity. |
| Genesis 2:16 | idol worship, as it is stated: “And the Lord God commanded the man” | Sanhedrin 56b:23 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Adam, the first</b> man, <b>was commanded only with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship, as it is stated: “And the Lord God commanded the man”</b> (Genesis 2:16). <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> He was <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning blessing the name</b> of God. <b>And some say</b> that he was <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> establishing courts of <b>judgment.</b> |
| Genesis 2:16 | saying” | Sanhedrin 57b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> from the verse that was already interpreted as teaching this <i>halakha</i>: “And the Lord God commanded the man, <b>saying”</b> (Genesis 2:16), <b>this</b> alludes to <b>forbidden sexual relations</b> (see 56b). |
| Genesis 2:18 | states: “I will make him [ lo ] a helpmate for him” | Ketubot 67b:2 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> Concerning <b>an orphan</b> boy <b>who has come to marry,</b> the community tries its utmost to provide for all of his needs. The charities <b>rent a house for him, arrange for him a bed and all his utensils, and thereafter</b> they <b>marry him a wife, as it is stated:</b> “But you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him <b>sufficient for his deficiency in that which is deficient for him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:8). With regard to the phrase <b>“sufficient for his deficiency,” this</b> is referring to <b>the house. “Which is deficient”; this</b> is referring to a <b>bed and table. “For him [<i>lo</i>]”; this</b> is referring to <b>a wife. And similarly</b> the verse <b>states: “I will make him [<i>lo</i>] a helpmate for him”</b> (Genesis 2:18), when God created a wife for Adam. |
| Genesis 2:18 | a man has several children, it is prohibited to remain without a wife, as it is stated: “It is not good that the man should be alone” | Yevamot 61b:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna’s wording that if <b>he</b> already <b>has children he may neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply,</b> but <b>he may not neglect</b> the mitzva to have <b>a wife.</b> This <b>supports</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> in the name of <b>Shmuel, who said: Even</b> if <b>a man has several children, it is prohibited to remain without a wife, as it is stated: “It is not good that the man should be alone”</b> (Genesis 2:18). |
| Genesis 2:18 | without goodness, as it is written: “It is not good that man should be alone” | Yevamot 62b:13 | § Apropos the discussion with regard to the mitzva to have children, the Gemara cites statements about marriage in general. <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanilai said: Any man who does not have a wife is</b> left <b>without joy, without blessing, without goodness.</b> He proceeds to quote verses to support each part of his statement. He is <b>without joy, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice, you and your household”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), which indicates that a man is in a joyful state only when he is with his household, i.e., his wife. He is <b>without blessing, as it is written: “To cause a blessing to rest in your house”</b> (Ezekiel 44:30), which indicates that blessing comes through one’s house, i.e., one’s wife. He is <b>without goodness, as it is written: “It is not good that man should be alone”</b> (Genesis 2:18), i.e., without a wife. |
| Genesis 2:18 | is written: “I will make him a helpmate for him [ kenegdo ]” | Yevamot 63a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “I will make him a helpmate for him [<i>kenegdo</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:18)? If one is <b>worthy</b> his wife <b>helps him;</b> if he is <b>not worthy</b> she is <b>against him. And some say</b> a slightly different version: <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the Torah with a spelling that allows it to be read: <b>Striking him [<i>kenagdo</i>], and we read</b> it as though it said: <b>For him [<i>kenegdo</i>].</b> If he is <b>worthy</b> she is <b>for him</b> as his helpmate; if he is <b>not worthy</b> she <b>strikes him.</b> |
| Genesis 2:19 | were created from the water. And it is written: “And from the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the air | Chullin 27b:11 | The Gemara relates an excerpt of an exchange between a Roman government official and Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai. <b>And furthermore,</b> the official <b>asked</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>One verse states: “And God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creeping animals, and birds will fly”</b> (Genesis 1:20); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the water. And it is written: “And from the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the air</b> and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them” (Genesis 2:19); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the land.</b> |
| Genesis 2:19 | formed | Chullin 27b:13 | <b>And some say</b> that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai spoke <b>to that officer with a different formulation,</b> i.e., he said to him that the birds were created from the water. <b>And he stated the first formulation,</b> that the birds were created from the mud, <b>to his students, because it is written: “And</b> from the ground the Lord God <b>formed</b> every beast of the field, and every bird of the air” (Genesis 2:19). According to this explanation, the birds are mentioned there not only because Adam called them names, but also because they too were created from the ground. |
| Genesis 2:19 | formation is stated with regard to | Niddah 22b:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges a fetus in the form of an animal has the same status as one who discharges a fetus with human form or gives birth to a human?

| Genesis 2:19 | written: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field” | Niddah 22b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that the term “and…formed” that appears <b>with regard to animals</b> is considered <b>free? If we say</b> it is due to the fact <b>that it is written: “And God made the animals of the earth</b> after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> similarly <b>written: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field”</b> (Genesis 2:19), and therefore this verse is superfluous, but <b>with regard to</b> the <b>sea monster as well,</b> the expression “and…created” is <b>free, as it is written:</b> “And God made…<b>and everything that creeps on the ground</b> after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And God created the great sea monsters.”</b> Consequently, the term “and…created” is also free on both sides of the verbal analogy. |

| Genesis 2:22 | built | Berakhot 61a:16 | The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <b>Granted, according to the one</b> who said that Eve was a <b>tail, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “And</b> the Lord God <b>built</b> the <i>tzela</i>” (Genesis 2:22); it was a completely new building. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a complete <b>face</b> or side, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And He built”?</b> What needed to be built? |
| Genesis 2:22 | “And brought her unto the man” | Berakhot 61a:19 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And brought her unto the man”</b> (Genesis 2:22), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said:</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was Adam the first</b> man’s <b>best man. From here, the Torah taught that it is a desired mode of behavior for a greater individual to seek out a lesser individual to</b> assist him and <b>serve as his best man.</b> The greater individual should help the lesser <b>and should not feel badly</b> about it, that it might be beneath his dignity. |
| Genesis 2:22 | He made | Berakhot 61a:6 | It is stated: <b>“And the <i>tzela</i> which the Lord, God,</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). |
| Genesis 2:22 | He made | Eruvin 18a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Adam</b> was first created with <b>two [<i>deyo</i>] faces,</b> one male and the other female. <b>As it is stated: “You have formed me behind and before,</b> and laid Your hand upon me” (Psalms 139:5). Similarly, <b>it is written: “And the <i>tzela</i>, which</b> the Lord, God, had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree over the meaning of the word <i>tzela</i>: <b>One said:</b> It means a female <b>face,</b> from which God created Eve; <b>and one said:</b> Adam was created with <b>a tail [<i>zanav</i>],</b> which God removed from him and from which He created Eve. |
| Genesis 2:22 | built | Eruvin 18a:26 | The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail;</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “And</b> the Lord God <b>built</b> the <i>tzela</i>” (Genesis 2:22), as it was a completely new building. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a complete <b>face</b> or side, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And He built”?</b> What needed to be built? |
| Genesis 2:22 | “And brought her unto the man” | Eruvin 18b:2 | The Gemara cites an exposition of the end of the previously cited verse: <b>“And brought her unto the man”</b> (Genesis 2:22). This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was Adam the first</b> man’s <b>best man,</b> attending to all his wedding needs and bringing his wife to him. <b>From here</b> we learn <b>that a greater individual should serve as a best man for a lesser individual and should not feel bad</b> about it as something beneath his dignity. |
| Genesis 2:22 | He made [ vayyiven ] | Niddah 45b:11 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the creation of woman: <b>“And the rib,</b> which <b>the Lord God</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made [<i>vayyiven</i>]</b> a woman, and brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:22). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, granted a woman a greater understanding [<i>bina</i>] than</b> that <b>of a men.</b> |
| Genesis 2:22 | “And the Lord God built the side | Shabbat 95a:1 | A woman <b>who applies eye shadow</b> is liable <b>due to dyeing;</b> one <b>who braids her hair and applies blush</b> is liable due to the prohibition against <b>building.</b> The Gemara asks about this: <b>And is that the</b> typical <b>manner of building?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> braiding one’s hair is considered building, <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“And the Lord God built the side</b> that He took from Adam into a woman” (Genesis 2:22), which <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided Eve’s</b> hair <b>and brought her to Adam.</b> From where is it derived that this is the meaning of built? It is <b>because in the islands of the sea they call braiding building. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who braids her hair</b> and <b>who applies eye shadow or blush</b> on Shabbat, if she did it <b>for herself, she is exempt;</b> if she did it <b>for another, she is liable.</b> This is because a woman cannot perform these actions for herself in as complete a fashion as she can for someone else. <b>And, so too, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would say in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: A woman may not apply rouge to her face</b> on Shabbat <b>because</b> by doing so <b>she is dyeing,</b> which is one of the prohibited labors on Shabbat. |
| Genesis 2:23 | is written: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” | Yevamot 63a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh”</b> (Genesis 2:23)? This <b>teaches that Adam had intercourse with each animal and beast</b> in his search for his mate, <b>and his mind was not at ease,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And for Adam, there was not found a helpmate for him” (Genesis 2:20), <b>until he had intercourse with Eve.</b> |
| Genesis 2:24 | verse states: “Shall cleave,” | Bava Batra113a:4 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> a different explanation. The <b>verse states: “Shall cleave,”</b> and this term alludes to marriage, as in the context of: “And he shall cleave to his wife” (Genesis 2:24). The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the term <b>“shall cleave” is written in both of</b> the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband. |
| Genesis 2:24 | a female descendant of Noah who committed adultery should not be executed, as it is written: “Therefore a man shall leave | Sanhedrin 57b:10 | Rav Avya asked further: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>a female descendant of Noah who committed adultery should not be executed, as it is written: “Therefore a man shall leave</b> his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:24); a man, <b>but not a woman?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> At the end of the verse it states: <b>“And they shall be one flesh.” The verse then combines</b> men and women, indicating that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both. |
| Genesis 2:24 | “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, | Sanhedrin 58a:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother,</b> and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:24), that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s sister,</b> i.e., one must abandon the possibility of marrying his father’s sister and marry someone else. <b>“His mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother’s sister. Rabbi Akiva says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s wife; “his mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother, literally.</b> |
| Genesis 2:24 | as it is stated: “And shall cleave | Sanhedrin 58b:14 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: A descendant of Noah who engages in intercourse with his wife in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>is liable</b> for engaging in forbidden sexual intercourse, <b>as it is stated: “And shall cleave</b> to his wife” (Genesis 2:24), an expression that indicates natural intercourse, <b>but not</b> intercourse <b>in an atypical manner.</b> |
| Genesis 3:3 | “God has said: You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it” | Sanhedrin 29a:34 | <b>Ḥizkiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that anyone who adds, subtracts?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> that Eve said: <b>“God has said: You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it”</b> (Genesis 3:3), whereas God had actually rendered prohibited only eating from the tree but not touching it, as it is stated: “But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it” (Genesis 2:17). Because Eve added that there was a prohibition against touching the tree, the snake showed her that touching it does not cause her to die, and she consequently sinned by eating from it as well. |
| Genesis 3:7 | they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves | Berakhot 40a:14 | We learned in the mishna: One who recited: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>over fruits of the earth,</b> did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious,</b> as fruits of the earth do not fall under the rubric of trees. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This ruling in the mishna <b>is only necessary according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> in another context that <b>wheat is a type of tree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tree from which Adam, the first</b> man, <b>ate, Rabbi Meir says: It was a vine, as nothing brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon man</b> even today <b>other than wine,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And he drank from the wine and became drunk”</b> (Genesis 9:21). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: It was a fig</b> tree, <b>as with the object with which they were corrupted</b> and sinned <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). They must have taken the leaves from the tree closest at hand, the Tree of Knowledge. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It was wheat, as,</b> even today, <b>the child does not know how to call</b> his <b>father and mother until he tastes the taste of grain.</b> |
| Genesis 3:7 | they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves, | Sanhedrin 70b:1 | <b>as,</b> even today, <b>nothing except wine brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon a person;</b> most sins are caused by drunkenness. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Tree of Knowledge <b>was</b> the <b>wheat</b> plant. This is proven by the fact <b>that,</b> even today, <b>an infant does not know how to call out</b> to his <b>father or mother until he tastes the taste of grain,</b> and for this reason wheat is called “the Tree of Knowledge.” <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> The Tree of Knowledge <b>was a fig</b> tree, <b>because</b> it was <b>with the matter with which they sinned</b> that <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves,</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). |
| Genesis 3:9 | was a heretic, as it is stated: “And the Lord called to the man and said to him: Where are you”? | Sanhedrin 38b:11 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Adam the first</b> man <b>was a heretic, as it is stated: “And the Lord called to the man and said to him: Where are you”?</b> (Genesis 3:9), meaning, to <b>where has your heart turned,</b> indicating that Adam turned from the path of truth. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: He was</b> one who <b>drew his foreskin</b> forward, so as to remove any indication that he was circumcised. It <b>is written here: “And they like men [<i>adam</i>] have transgressed the covenant”</b> (Hosea 6:7), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there:</b> “And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; <b>he has broken My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 3:11 | “Have you eaten of [ hamin ] the tree, | Chullin 139b:11 | They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the hanging of <b>Haman?</b> He replied: The verse states after Adam ate from the tree of knowledge: <b>“Have you eaten of [<i>hamin</i>] the tree,</b> about which I commanded you that you should not eat?” (Genesis 3:11). <i>Hamin</i> is spelled in the same manner as Haman: <i>Heh</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>. |
| Genesis 3:12 | “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat” | Avodah Zarah5b:1 | <b>this light bread”</b> (Numbers 21:5), despite the fact it was the highest-quality food. Moses further called them <b>children of ingrates, as it is written</b> that after sinning and eating from the tree of knowledge, Adam said: <b>“The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat”</b> (Genesis 3:12). Adam complained that the woman had been given to him in order to cause him to sin, whereas in fact she had been given to him to serve as a helpmate. |
| Genesis 3:14 | “Cursed are you from among all animals, and from among all beasts of the field” | Bekhorot 8a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that the gestation period of a snake is seven years, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and</b> some <b>determined it</b> to be <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya:</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated</b> with regard to the punishment of the snake for causing Adam and Eve to sin: <b>“Cursed are you from among all animals, and from among all beasts of the field”</b> (Genesis 3:14), in that your gestation period should be longer than all of them. Now, why does the verse mention the beasts of the field, i.e., undomesticated animals? <b>If</b> the snake <b>was cursed</b> more <b>than the domesticated animals,</b> then <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that it was cursed more <b>than the undomesticated animals?</b> The shortest gestation period of domesticated animals, which is five months for a goat, is longer than the shortest gestation period among undomesticated animals, which is fifty-two days for a cat. |
| Genesis 3:14 | will be king over every domesticated animal and non-domesticated animal, but now he is cursed more than all the domesticated animals and all the non-domesticated animals of the field, | Sotah 9b:1 | <b>And, so too, we found with regard to the primeval snake</b> who seduced Eve, <b>for he placed his eyes on that which was unfit for him,</b> as he wanted to marry Eve. Consequently, <b>that which he desired was not given to him, and that which was in his possession was taken from him. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I</b> initially <b>said</b> that the snake <b>will be king over every domesticated animal and non-domesticated animal, but now he is cursed more than all the domesticated animals and all the non-domesticated animals of the field,</b> as it is stated: “And the Lord God said unto the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:14). |
| Genesis 3:15 | now: “I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed” | Sotah 9b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> explains the elements of this curse. <b>I said</b> that the snake <b>will walk upright,</b> but <b>now he shall go on his belly; I said</b> that <b>his food will be</b> the same as the <b>food</b> eaten by <b>a person,</b> but <b>now he shall eat dust.</b> The snake <b>said: I will kill Adam and marry Eve,</b> but <b>now: “I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed”</b> (Genesis 3:15). |
| Genesis 3:16 | it is written: | Eruvin 100b:20 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>Is that so?</b> Is it proper for a woman to demand her conjugal rights from her husband? <b>But didn’t Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi say: Eve was cursed with ten curses,</b> due to the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, as <b>it is written:</b> “To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your travail; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and yet your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you” (Genesis 3:16)? |
| Genesis 3:16 | a woman in childbirth. While, with regard to a woman in childbirth, it is written: “In pain [ be’etzev ] | Pesachim 118a:6 | With regard to the praise due to God for sustaining the world, the Gemara cites a statement that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is twice as difficult as</b> the suffering endured by <b>a woman in childbirth. While, with regard to a woman in childbirth, it is written: “In pain [<i>be’etzev</i>]</b> you shall bring forth children” (Genesis 3:16), <b>with regard to food, it is written: “In toil [<i>be’itzavon</i>]</b> you shall eat of it, all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:17). <i>Itzavon</i> is a superlative form of <i>etzev</i>, which indicates that it is more difficult to support oneself than to give birth. |
| Genesis 3:16 | derived from there: “And your desire shall be to your husband” | Yevamot 62b:17 | The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> last statement <b>derived from here?</b> It is <b>derived from there: “And your desire shall be to your husband”</b> (Genesis 3:16), which <b>teaches that a wife desires her husband when he is about to depart on a journey. Rav Yosef said:</b> The additional derivation cited by Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>is necessary only near</b> the time of <b>her set pattern,</b> i.e., when she expects to begin experiencing menstrual bleeding. Although the Sages generally prohibited intercourse at this time due to a concern that the couple might have intercourse after she begins bleeding, if he is about to depart on a journey he must have intercourse with her. |
| Genesis 3:17 | with regard to food, it is written: “In toil [ be’itzavon ] | Pesachim 118a:6 | With regard to the praise due to God for sustaining the world, the Gemara cites a statement that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is twice as difficult as</b> the suffering endured by <b>a woman in childbirth.

| Genesis 3:18 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Adam: “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you, | Pesachim 118a:8 | The Gemara cites a similar statement. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Adam: “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you,</b> and you shall eat the herb of the field” (Genesis 3:18), <b>his eyes streamed with tears.</b> Adam <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> will <b>my donkey and I eat from one trough? After</b> God <b>said to him: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19), <b>his mind was settled,</b> assured that if he toils he will be able to eat bread, unlike the donkey. |
| Genesis 3:19 | chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven, | Avodah Zarah8a:7 | With regard to the dates of these festivals, <b>the Sages taught: When Adam the first</b> man <b>saw</b> that <b>the day was progressively diminishing,</b> as the days become shorter from the autumnal equinox until the winter solstice, he did not yet know that this is a normal phenomenon, and therefore he <b>said: Woe</b> is <b>me; perhaps because I sinned the world is becoming dark around me and</b> will ultimately <b>return to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven,</b> as it is written: “And to dust shall you return” (Genesis 3:19). <b>He arose and spent eight days in fasting and in prayer.</b> |
| Genesis 3:19 | Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread” | Berakhot 57b:14 | Similarly: <b>Six matters are good omens for the sick: Sneezing, sweating, diarrhea, a seminal emission, sleep, and a dream.</b> These are all alluded to in Scripture: <b>Sneezing, as it is written: “His sneezes flash forth light”</b> (Job 41:10), indicating that by means of a sneeze one comes to see the light of the world. <b>Sweat, as it is written: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread”</b> (Genesis 3:19). <b>Diarrhea, as it is written: “He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit”</b> (Isaiah 51:14). <b>A seminal emission, as it is written: “That he might see his seed, prolong his days”</b> (Isaiah 53:10). <b>Sleep, as it is written: “I should have slept; then had I been at rest”</b> (Job 3:13). <b>A dream, as it is written: “Wherefore You recover me [<i>vataḥalimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16); <i>vataḥalimeni</i> is interpreted as etymologically similar to <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Genesis 3:19 | said to him: “In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread” | Pesachim 118a:8 | The Gemara cites a similar statement. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Adam: “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you,</b> and you shall eat the herb of the field” (Genesis 3:18), <b>his eyes streamed with tears.</b> Adam <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> will <b>my donkey and I eat from one trough?

| Genesis 3:19 | he said: But it is written: “For you are dust and you shall return to dust” | Shabbat 152b:12 | Rav Naḥman once again asked Rav Aḥai about the preservation of the flesh, and <b>he said: But it is written: “For you are dust and you shall return to dust”</b> (Genesis 3:19), so why has your body not turned into dust? He <b>said to him: That</b> verse applies to the righteous only <b>one hour before the resurrection of the dead,</b> so that they, too, may be created anew (Maharsha). |
| Genesis 3:20 | from here: “As she was the mother of all living” | Ketubot 61a:3 | <b>And we answered his</b> question <b>from this</b> amoraic statement: When a woman marries a man, <b>she ascends with him</b> to his socioeconomic status, if it is higher than hers, <b>but she does not descend with him</b> if his status is lower. Consequently, if his family is not accustomed to nurse, she is not obligated to nurse either. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is derived from: <b>“She is a man’s wife”</b> (Genesis 20:3). The Gemara explains: The word used here for “wife [<i>be’ula</i>]” hints through similar spelling that she ascends in status <b>with the ascension [<i>aliya</i>] of her husband but does not</b> descend <b>with the descent of her husband. Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There is a hint to this principle <b>from here: “As she was the mother of all living”</b> (Genesis 3:20), which indicates that <b>she was given</b> to her husband <b>for living</b> with him, <b>but was not given to</b> suffer <b>pain</b> with him. |
| Genesis 3:21 | “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them” | Niddah 25a:9 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion that the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies only in a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya,</b> who is the same Rabbi Yehoshua who disagrees with the Rabbis with regard to the case of a woman who discharges a gestational sac in which tissue did not develop, <b>taught this</b> following proof for his opinion that the woman is impure: It is stated: <b>“And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not make skin for a person unless he is</b> already <b>created,</b> as God first created Adam and Eve, and then gave them skin. Consequently, the existence of a gestational sac proves that there is an offspring. |
| Genesis 3:21 | the garment of Adam, the first | Pesachim 54b:1 | <b>the garment of Adam, the first</b> man, was created at this time, as it is stated: “And God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). |
| Genesis 3:21 | Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them” | Sotah 14a:4 | He explains: <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that one should follow the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> He provides several examples. <b>Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you clothe the naked.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, visits the sick, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: <b>“And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you visit the sick.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, consoles mourners, as it is written: “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son”</b> (Genesis 25:11), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you console mourners.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you bury the dead.</b> |
| Genesis 3:21 | garments of skin, | Sotah 14a:5 | The Gemara discusses the verse: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife <b>garments of skin,</b> and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the meaning of the term “garments of skin.” <b>One says</b> that these garments were made of <b>something that comes from the skin, and one says</b> that these garments were <b>something from which the skin benefits.</b> |
| Genesis 3:21 | Torah, its beginning is an act of kindness and its end is an act of kindness. Its beginning is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them” | Sotah 14a:6 | <b>Rabbi Samlai taught:</b> With regard to the <b>Torah, its beginning is an act of kindness and its end is an act of kindness.

| Genesis 3:24 | And likewise it says: “And the flaming [ lahat ] sword that turned every way” | Sanhedrin 67b:10 | <b>Rabbi Aivu bar Nagri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that in the verse: “And the magicians of Egypt did in that manner <b>with their secret arts [<i>belateihem</i>]”</b> (Exodus 7:22), <b>these</b> words <b>are</b> describing <b>acts of</b> employing <b>demons,</b> which are invisible, and their actions are therefore hidden [<i>balat</i>]. With regard to the similar term <b>“<i>belahateihem</i>”</b> (Exodus 7:11), <b>these are acts of sorcery,</b> which sorcerers perform themselves, without using demons. <b>And likewise it says: “And the flaming [<i>lahat</i>] sword that turned every way”</b> (Genesis 3:24), referring to a sword that revolves by itself. |
| Genesis 4:2 | as it is written: “And again she bore his brother [ et aḥiv ] Abel [ et Hevel ]” | Yevamot 62a:7 | <b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason of Rabbi Natan, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And again she bore his brother [<i>et aḥiv</i>] Abel [<i>et Hevel</i>]”</b> (Genesis 4:2). The use of the superfluous word “et” indicates that she gave birth to <b>Abel and his sister,</b> in addition to <b>Cain and his sister. And it states: “For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him”</b> (Genesis 4:25). This indicates that one must have at least four children. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> how do they understand this verse? In their opinion, Eve <b>was thanking God</b> for granting her another child, but one is not obligated to have four children. |
| Genesis 4:4 | the descendants of Noah sacrificed peace offerings? As it is written: “And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof” | Zevachim 116a:14 | The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>the descendants of Noah sacrificed peace offerings? As it is written: “And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof”</b> (Genesis 4:4). Abel, like all gentiles, is categorized as a descendant of Noah. The verse emphasizes that the fat was sacrificed. The Gemara analyzes: <b>What is an item,</b> i.e., an offering, <b>the fat of which is sacrificed upon the altar, but</b> that <b>is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar? You must say: This is the peace offering,</b> the meat of which is consumed. |
| Genesis 4:7 | is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [ ḥatat ] couches at the door” | Berakhot 61a:27 | <b>Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:1). <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The evil inclination <b>is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [<i>ḥatat</i>] couches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7); <i>ḥatat</i> is interpreted homiletically as related to <i>ḥitta</i>, wheat. |
| Genesis 4:7 | as it is stated: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up?” | Kiddushin 30b:4 | <b>So</b> too <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: My children, I created an evil inclination,</b> which is the wound, <b>and I created Torah as its antidote. If you are engaged in Torah</b> study <b>you will not be given over into the hand</b> of the evil inclination, <b>as it is stated: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up?”</b> (Genesis 4:7). One who engages in Torah study lifts himself above the evil inclination. |
| Genesis 4:7 | you are given over to its power, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the door” | Kiddushin 30b:5 | <b>And if you do not engage in Torah</b> study, <b>you are given over to its power, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7). <b>Moreover, all</b> of the evil inclination’s <b>deliberations</b> will be <b>concerning you, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And to you is its desire.” And if you wish you shall rule over it, as it is stated</b> in the conclusion of the verse: <b>“But you may rule over it”</b> (Genesis 4:7). |
| Genesis 4:7 | “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door” | Kiddushin 61b:9 | § The Gemara proceeds to analyze these two opinions: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who requires a compound condition, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written,</b> with regard to God’s rebuke of Cain: <b>“If you do well, shall it not be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7). <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Gamliel, <b>why do I</b> need both sides of this stipulation to be specified? The Gemara answers: Were it not for the double formulation it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse means: <b>If you do well</b> shall you not receive <b>a reward?</b> And <b>if you do not do well</b> you will receive <b>neither reward nor punishment.</b> The double formulation of the verse <b>teaches us</b> that if Cain fails to do well he will be actively punished. |
| Genesis 4:7 | emerges into the airspace of the world, an angel comes and slaps it on its mouth, causing it to forget the entire Torah, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance” | Niddah 30b:23 | <b>And once</b> the fetus <b>emerges into the airspace of the world, an angel comes and slaps it on its mouth, causing it to forget the entire Torah, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance”</b> (Genesis 4:7), i.e., when a person enters the world he is immediately liable to sin due to his loss of Torah knowledge. |
| Genesis 4:7 | supports him, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance” | Sanhedrin 91b:7 | <b>And Antoninos said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>From when does the evil inclination dominate a person?</b> Is it <b>from the moment of</b> the <b>formation</b> of the embryo <b>or from the moment of emergence</b> from the womb? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>from the moment of</b> the <b>formation</b> of the embryo. Antoninos <b>said to him: If so,</b> the evil inclination would cause the fetus to <b>kick his mother’s innards and emerge</b> from the womb. <b>Rather, the evil inclination dominates a person from the moment of emergence</b> from the womb. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Antoninos taught me this matter, and</b> there is <b>a verse</b> that <b>supports him, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance”</b> (Genesis 4:7), indicating that it is from the moment of birth, when the newborn emerges from the entrance of his mother’s womb, that the evil inclination lurks. |
| Genesis 4:7 | “Sin lies in waiting at the door” | Yoma 20a:1 | <b>“Sin lies in waiting at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7), and it is no wonder that men sin. He asked him: <b>And what did Satan</b> the prosecutor <b>say</b> about their sinning? Elijah <b>said to him: Satan, on Yom Kippur, has no license to prosecute. From where</b> is that idea derived? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: The numerological value</b> of the letters that constitute the word <b><i>HaSatan</i> is three hundred and sixty four:</b> <i>Heh</i> has a value of five, <i>sin</i> has a value of three hundred, <i>tet</i> has a value of nine, and <i>nun</i> has a value of fifty. <b>Three hundred and sixty-four days</b> of the solar year, which is three hundred and sixty-five days long, Satan <b>has license to prosecute.</b> On the remaining day, <b>Yom Kippur, he has no license to prosecute.</b> Since that day is exalted above all others, there is no room for the accusations of Satan. |
| Genesis 4:7 | “ Se’et ” | Yoma 52b:1 | The first example is the term: <b>“<i>Se’et</i>”</b> (Genesis 4:7). It is unclear whether the verse should be read: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up [<i>se’et</i>]?” in which case <i>se’et</i> involves forgiveness and pardon; or: “If you do well, but you will lift up [<i>se’et</i>] your sin if you do not do well.” According to this interpretation, <i>se’et</i> is referring to remembrance: If you do not do well, your sin will be remembered. |
| Genesis 4:10 | your brother’s blood [ demei ] cries | Sanhedrin 37a:12 | The proof for this is <b>as we found with Cain, who killed his brother, as it is stated</b> concerning him: “The voice of <b>your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>] cries</b> out to Me from the ground” (Genesis 4:10). The verse <b>does not state: Your brother’s blood [<i>dam</i>],</b> in the singular, <b>but</b> rather: <b>“Your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>],”</b> in the plural. This serves to teach that the loss of both <b>his</b> brother’s <b>blood and the blood of his</b> brother’s <b>offspring</b> are ascribed to Cain. The mishna notes: <b>Alternatively,</b> the phrase <b>“your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>],”</b> written in the plural, teaches <b>that his blood</b> was not gathered in one place but was <b>splattered on the trees and on the stones.</b> |
| Genesis 4:10 | Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: | Sanhedrin 37b:10 | § The mishna teaches that the court would say: <b>You should know</b> that cases of capital law are not like cases of monetary law, and would reference the murder of Abel by Cain. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says:</b> By employing the plural term for blood, “The voice of your brother’s blood [<i>demei</i>] cries out to Me from the ground” (Genesis 4:10), the verse <b>teaches that Cain caused multiple wounds</b> and <b>multiple injuries to his brother Abel. As</b> Cain <b>did not know from where the soul departs,</b> he struck him multiple times. This continued <b>until he came to his neck</b> and struck him there, whereupon Abel died. |
| Genesis 4:13 | My punishment is greater than I can bear” | Arakhin 15b:19 | <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations it is written</b> that when Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Joseph he responded: <b>“How can I do this great wickedness,</b> and sin against God” (Genesis 39:9). <b>With regard to bloodshed it is written,</b> after Cain murdered his brother: “And Cain said to the Lord: <b>My punishment is greater than I can bear”</b> (Genesis 4:13). The Torah describes each of these three cardinal sins with the word “great” in the singular, whereas malicious speech is described with the plural term “great things,” indicating that it is equivalent to all three of the other transgressions together. |
| Genesis 4:13 | as it is written: “My sin is too great to bear” | Sanhedrin 101b:3 | Apropos Manasseh’s repentance, the Gemara cites that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three came with a demand,</b> and <b>these are they: Cain, Esau, and Manasseh. Cain</b> came with a demand, <b>as it is written: “My sin is too great to bear”</b> (Genesis 4:13). Cain <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, is my transgression greater than</b> the transgression of <b>the 600,000 who are destined to sin before You</b> with the Golden Calf, <b>and You</b> will nevertheless <b>forgive them?</b> There should be atonement for my transgression as well. <b>Esau</b> came with a demand, <b>as it is stated: “Have you but one blessing, my father?”</b> (Genesis 27:38). With regard to Manasseh, <b>initially he called to multiple gods,</b> and his prayers were not answered, <b>and ultimately he called to the God of his forefathers</b> with the demand: If God does not answer my prayer, then apparently all the gods are equal to the God of my forefathers. |
| Genesis 4:14 | “Whosoever finds me will slay me” | Nedarim 41a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, and some say Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Once the end</b> of the time allotted for the life of <b>a person arrived, everything has dominion over him, as it is stated</b> that Cain said: <b>“Whosoever finds me will slay me”</b> (Genesis 4:14). Cain feared that since God sentenced him to death he would be susceptible to all threats and vulnerable to anyone seeking to murder him. <b>Rav said</b> that it is derived <b>from this verse: “They stand this day according to Your judgments; for all are Your servants”</b> (Psalms 119:91). When the decree emerges from Heaven that the time has arrived for a person to die, everyone is a servant of God, an agent to kill him. |
| Genesis 4:14 | “And I shall be a fugitive [ na ] and a wanderer [ vanad ] | Sanhedrin 37b:12 | <b>And Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: Exile atones</b> for <b>half</b> of <b>a sin.</b> As <b>initially</b> it <b>is written</b> in the verse concerning Cain that he said: <b>“And I shall be a fugitive [<i>na</i>] and a wanderer [<i>vanad</i> ]</b> in the earth” (Genesis 4:14), <b>and ultimately</b> it <b>is written:</b> “And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, <b>and dwelt in the land of Nod”</b> (Genesis 4:16). Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, equates “Nod” with “<i>nad</i>,” and understands that Cain was given only the punishment of being a wanderer. Exile atoned for half his sin, thereby negating the punishment of being a fugitive. |
| Genesis 4:16 | and dwelt in the land of Nod” | Sanhedrin 37b:12 | <b>And Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: Exile atones</b> for <b>half</b> of <b>a sin.</b> As <b>initially</b> it <b>is written</b> in the verse concerning Cain that he said: <b>“And I shall be a fugitive [<i>na</i>] and a wanderer [<i>vanad</i> ]</b> in the earth” (Genesis 4:14), <b>and ultimately</b> it <b>is written:</b> “And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, <b>and dwelt in the land of Nod”</b> (Genesis 4:16).

| Genesis 4:23 | as it is written: “And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lemech, | Sanhedrin 38b:21 | The Gemara relates: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei:</b> It <b>is written: “And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord</b> out of heaven” (Genesis 19:24). The heretic raised the question: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>From Him</b> out of heaven. <b>A certain launderer said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>Leave him be; I will respond to him.</b> This is <b>as it is written: “And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lemech,</b> hearken to my speech” (Genesis 4:23). One can raise the question: <b>It should have</b> been written: <b>My wives,</b> and not: “Wives of Lemech.” <b>Rather, it is</b> the style of <b>the verse</b> to <b>speak in this</b> manner. <b>Here too, it is</b> the style of <b>the verse</b> to <b>speak in this</b> manner. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> the launderer: <b>From where did you</b> hear <b>this</b> interpretation? The launderer <b>said to him: I heard it at the lecture of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Genesis 4:25 | Cain and his sister. And it states: “For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him” | Yevamot 62a:7 | <b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason of Rabbi Natan, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And again she bore his brother [<i>et aḥiv</i>] Abel [<i>et Hevel</i>]”</b> (Genesis 4:2). The use of the superfluous word “et” indicates that she gave birth to <b>Abel and his sister,</b> in addition to <b>Cain and his sister. And it states: “For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him”</b> (Genesis 4:25). This indicates that one must have at least four children. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> how do they understand this verse? In their opinion, Eve <b>was thanking God</b> for granting her another child, but one is not obligated to have four children. |
| Genesis 4:26 | From desecrating it [ meḥallelo ], but rather: He is forgiven [ maḥul lo ]. | Shabbat 118b:3 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who observes Shabbat in accordance with its <i>halakhot</i>, even</b> if he <b>worships idolatry as</b> in <b>the generation of Enosh,</b> God <b>forgives him</b> his sins, <b>as it is stated: “Fortunate is the man [enosh] who does this</b> and the person who holds strong to it, one who guards the Shabbat <b>from desecrating it [<i>meḥallelo</i>],</b> and guards his hand from doing any evil” (Isaiah 56:2). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>From desecrating it [<i>meḥallelo</i>], but rather: He is forgiven [<i>maḥul lo</i>].</b> With regard to the generation of Enosh it is written: “And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began [<i>huḥal</i>] to call upon the Name of God” (Genesis 4:26), meaning to desecrate [<i>leḥallel</i>] His name. |
| Genesis 5:1 | which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam, | Avodah Zarah5a:9 | The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Reish Lakish say: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam,</b> in the day that God created man” (Genesis 5:1)? <b>Did Adam the first</b> man <b>have a book?</b> Rather, the verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Adam, the first</b> man, <b>every generation and its expositors, every generation and its Sages,</b> and <b>every generation and its leaders. When</b> Adam <b>arrived at the generation of Rabbi Akiva, he rejoiced in his Torah and was saddened by his death,</b> as Rabbi Akiva was tortured and murdered. Adam <b>said: “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God!</b> How great is the sum of them” (Psalms 139:17). It is evident from here that the Jews were destined to bear future generations from the beginning of time. |
| Genesis 5:1 | which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam” | Sanhedrin 38b:10 | <b>And this,</b> i.e., that the verse in Psalms is stated by Adam, is what <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam”</b> (Genesis 5:1)? This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed</b> Adam <b>every generation and its</b> Torah <b>interpreters, every generation and its wise ones. When he arrived at</b> his vision of <b>the generation of Rabbi Akiva,</b> Adam <b>was gladdened by his Torah, and saddened by his</b> manner of <b>death. He said: “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God,”</b> i.e., how it weighs upon me that a man as great as Rabbi Akiva should suffer. |
| Genesis 5:2 | it is written: “Male and female, He created them” | Berakhot 61a:14 | <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>face, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b> The Gemara answers: It can be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu.</b> As <b>Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,” and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), indicating that man was created alone. <b>How, then,</b> does he resolve the contradiction? <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 5:2 | that it is written: “Male and female, He created them, | Eruvin 18a:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was <b>a face,</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “Male and female, He created them,</b> and blessed them, and called their name Man in the day when they were created” (Genesis 5:2), which indicates that from the very beginning of their creation, He fashioned two faces, one for the male and the other for the female. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b> |
| Genesis 5:2 | it is written: “Male and female He created them” | Ketubot 8a:9 | The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it was</b> only <b>one act of creation.</b> However, one <b>Sage holds:</b> It is <b>according to</b> the initial <b>thought</b> that <b>we proceed. And</b> one <b>Sage holds:</b> It is <b>according to</b> the <b>action</b> that <b>we proceed.</b> God’s initial thought was to create man and woman as separate entities. Ultimately, they were created as one entity. That explanation is <b>like the following. Rav Yehuda raises a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “And God created man in His own image”</b> (Genesis 1:27), indicating one act of creation, <b>and</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “Male and female He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2), indicating two acts. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> apparent contradiction be resolved? <b>Initially, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, but ultimately only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 5:2 | He created them” | Megillah 9a:13 | Instead of: “And on the seventh day God concluded His work” (Genesis 2:2), which could have been understood as though some of His work was completed on Shabbat itself, they wrote: <b>And on the sixth day He concluded</b> His work, <b>and He rested on the seventh day.</b> They also wrote: <b>Male and female He created him, and they did not write</b> as it is written in the Torah: “Male and female <b>He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2), to avoid the impression that there is a contradiction between this verse and the verse: “And God created man” (Genesis 1:27), which indicates that God created one person. |
| Genesis 5:2 | two males, and Beit Hillel say: A male and a female, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them” | Yevamot 61b:15 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man may not neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply unless he</b> already <b>has children. Beit Shammai say:</b> One fulfills this mitzva with <b>two males, and Beit Hillel say: A male and a female, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2). |
| Genesis 5:2 | Rabbi Elazar said: Any man who does not have a wife is not a man, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them…and called their name Adam” | Yevamot 63a:2 | § The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for a series of statements cited in the name of Rabbi Elazar: <b>Woman; and land; helper; this; two; the blessings; merchants; lowly.</b> The Gemara presents these statements: <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Any man who does not have a wife is not a man, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them…and called their name Adam”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Any man who does not have</b> his own <b>land is not a man, as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth He has given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16). |
| Genesis 5:3 | he bore spirits, demons, and female demons, as it is stated: “And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, | Eruvin 18b:10 | Having cited an aggadic statement of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, the Gemara cites other statements of his: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: All those years during which Adam was ostracized</b> for the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, <b>he bore spirits, demons, and female demons, as it is stated: “And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image,</b> and called his name Seth” (Genesis 5:3). <b>By inference, until now,</b> the age of one hundred thirty, <b>he did not bear after his image,</b> but rather bore other creatures. |
| Genesis 5:29 | “This is one who shall comfort us for our work and the toil of our hands” | Sanhedrin 113b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach”</b> (Proverbs 18:3). When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>is eliminated from the world, good comes into the world, as it is stated: “And when the wicked perish there is jubilation”</b> (Proverbs 11:10). When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>passes from the world, evil comes into the world, as it is stated: “The righteous perishes and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken, none understand that due to the evil the righteous is taken”</b> (Isaiah 57:1) When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>comes into the world, good comes into the world</b> with him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“This is one who shall comfort us for our work and the toil of our hands”</b> (Genesis 5:29). |
| Genesis 5:32 | wisdom, as it is written: “And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth” | Sanhedrin 69b:15 | <b>Know</b> that it is true <b>that the verse</b> sometimes <b>lists</b> brothers not according to their birth order, but <b>in the order of their</b> degrees of <b>wisdom, as it is written: “And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth”</b> (Genesis 5:32). According to this, <b>Shem was</b> at least <b>one year older than Ham, and Ham one year older than Japheth,</b> so <b>it turns out</b> that <b>Shem was two years older than Japheth. And it is written: “And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 7:6). <b>And it is written: “These are the descendants of Shem; Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood”</b> (Genesis 11:10). If Shem was the oldest brother, how could he be only <b>100 years old? He must have been</b> at least <b>102 years old,</b> as Noah was 500 years old when his third son was born, and he was 600 years old at the time of the flood. |
| Genesis 6:1 | “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply [ larov ] on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them” | Bava Batra16b:6 | The Gemara cites another place where Job is mentioned. <b>“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply [<i>larov</i>] on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them”</b> (Genesis 6:1). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> <i>Larov</i> means that <b>propagation [<i>reviyya</i>] came to the world</b> through these daughters. <b>Reish Lakish says: Strife [<i>meriva</i>] came to the world.</b> Once daughters were born, the men began to fight among themselves over them. <b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to you who say</b> that due to the daughters <b>propagation came to the world, for what</b> reason <b>were</b> the number of <b>Job’s daughters not doubled,</b> when at the end of the story God doubled everything that Job had lost (see Job 1:3, 42:12)? |
| Genesis 6:1 | was famine. “And it came to pass [ vayhi ], when men began to multiply” | Megillah 10b:5 | The Gemara cites several proofs corroborating this interpretation. <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> led to grief, as there <b>was Haman. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days when the judges ruled”</b> (Ruth 1:1) introduces a period when there <b>was famine. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>], when men began to multiply”</b> (Genesis 6:1) is immediately followed by the verse: <b>“And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:5). |
| Genesis 6:2 | and they took for themselves wives from anyone they chose” | Sanhedrin 108a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The generation of the flood became haughty due only to the</b> covetousness of the <b>eyeball, which is similar to water, as it is stated:</b> “And the sons of the prominent men saw that the daughters of men were fair; <b>and they took for themselves wives from anyone they chose”</b> (Genesis 6:2). <b>Consequently,</b> God <b>punished them with water, which is similar to an eyeball [<i>legalgal ha’ayin</i>], as it is stated: “All the fountains [<i>mayenot</i>] of the great deep were breached, and the flues of heaven were opened”</b> (Genesis 7:11). |
| Genesis 6:2 | it atones for the actions of Uzza and Azael. | Yoma 67b:7 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Azazel</b> is so called because <b>it atones for the actions of Uzza and Azael.</b> These are the names of “sons of God” who sinned with “daughters of men” (Genesis 6:2) and thereby caused the world to sin during the generation of the Flood. |
| Genesis 6:3 | “For that he also [ beshaggam ] is flesh; | Chullin 139b:10 | § <b>The</b> residents <b>of Pappunya said to Rav Mattana:</b> If one <b>found a nest on the head of a person, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the mitzva of sending away the mother? Is the nest considered to be on the ground, such that one is obligated in the mitzva? Rav Mattana <b>said</b> to them that one is obligated in the mitzva in such a case because the verse states: <b>“And earth upon his head”</b> (II Samuel 15:32), rather than: Dirt upon his head, indicating that one’s head is considered like the ground. They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> is the existence of <b>Moses [<i>Moshe</i>]</b> alluded to before his birth? He replied that the verse states: <b>“For that he also [<i>beshaggam</i>] is flesh;</b> therefore shall his days be one hundred and twenty years” (Genesis 6:3). The numerical value of <i>beshaggam</i> is the same as that of the Hebrew name <i>Moshe</i>, and it is known that Moses lived a total of 120 years (see Deuteronomy 34:7). |
| Genesis 6:3 | as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [ yadon ] in man forever” | Sanhedrin 107b:18 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The members of <b>the generation of the flood have no share in the World-to-Come and will not stand in judgment</b> at the end of days, <b>as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [<i>yadon</i>] in man forever”</b> (Genesis 6:3); <b>neither</b> will they stand in <b>judgment [<i>din</i>] nor</b> shall their <b>souls</b> be restored to them. The members of <b>the generation of the dispersion have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the Lord scattered them from there upon the face of all the earth”</b> (Genesis 11:8), <b>and it is written: “And from there did the Lord scatter them</b> upon the face of all the earth” (Genesis 11:9). <b>“And the Lord scattered them”</b> indicates <b>in this world; “and from there did the Lord scatter them”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come. The people of Sodom have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly”</b> (Genesis 13:13). <b>“Wicked”</b> indicates <b>in this world; “and sinners”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come.

| Genesis 6:3 | neither live nor be judged, as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [ yadon ] in man forever” | Sanhedrin 108a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The members of <b>the generation of the flood have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And He obliterated every living thing that was upon the face of the ground,</b> from man to cattle to creeping animal to the birds of the heaven; and they were obliterated from the earth” (Genesis 7:23). <b>“And He obliterated every living thing”</b> indicates <b>in this world,</b> whereas <b>“and they were obliterated from the earth”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> The members of the generation of the flood will <b>neither live nor be judged, as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [<i>yadon</i>] in man forever”</b> (Genesis 6:3), meaning <b>neither</b> will they stand in <b>judgment [<i>din</i>], nor</b> shall their <b>souls</b> be restored to them. <b>Alternatively, “My soul shall not abide”</b> means <b>their souls will not return to their sheaths [<i>nadan</i>],</b> i.e., to their bodies. |
| Genesis 6:5 | was only evil continuously” | Bava Batra16a:8 | <b>Reish Lakish says: Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are one,</b> that is, they are three aspects of the same essence. <b>He is the Satan</b> who seduces people and then accuses them, <b>as it is written: “So the Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord,</b> and smote Job with vile sores” (Job 2:7). <b>He is</b> also <b>the evil inclination,</b> as <b>it is written there:</b> “The impulse of the thoughts of his heart <b>was only evil continuously”</b> (Genesis 6:5); <b>and it is written here: “Only upon himself do not put forth your hand”</b> (Job 1:12). The verbal analogy between the various uses of the word “only” teaches that the evil inclination is to be identified with the Satan. <b>He is</b> also <b>the Angel of Death, as it is written: “Only spare his life”</b> (Job 2:6); <b>apparently</b> Job’s life <b>depends upon him,</b> the Satan, and accordingly the Satan must also be the Angel of Death. |
| Genesis 6:5 | only evil all day [ kol hayyom ]” | Kiddushin 30b:6 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> So <b>difficult is the evil inclination that even its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Rav Yitzḥak says: A person’s</b> evil <b>inclination renews itself to him every day, as it is stated:</b> “And that every inclination of the thoughts in his heart was <b>only evil all day [<i>kol hayyom</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:5). “<i>Kol hayyom</i>” can also be understood as: Every day. |
| Genesis 6:5 | “And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth” | Megillah 10b:5 | The Gemara cites several proofs corroborating this interpretation. <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> led to grief, as there <b>was Haman. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days when the judges ruled”</b> (Ruth 1:1) introduces a period when there <b>was famine. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>], when men began to multiply”</b> (Genesis 6:1) is immediately followed by the verse: <b>“And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:5). |
| Genesis 6:5 | the generation of the flood, | Sanhedrin 108a:1 | <b>in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 1:5). <b>“Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment”; this</b> is referring to <b>the generation of the flood,</b> about whom it is written: “The wickedness of man was great upon the earth” (Genesis 6:5). <b>“Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”; these are the people of Sodom,</b> about whom it is written: “And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners” (Genesis 13:13). The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya: <b>They will not stand</b> in judgment for resurrection <b>in the congregation of the righteous, but they will stand</b> in judgment <b>in the congregation of the wicked.</b> |
| Genesis 6:5 | the generation of the flood sinned with “great” and were punished with “great.” They sinned with “great,” as it is stated: “And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great” | Sanhedrin 108a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The members of <b>the generation of the flood sinned with “great” and were punished with “great.” They sinned with “great,” as it is stated: “And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great”</b> (Genesis 6:5). <b>And they were punished with great, as it is stated: “All the fountains of the great deep</b> were breached” (Genesis 7:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three</b> fountains <b>of</b> the great deep that were breached in the flood <b>remained,</b> and boiling water continues to flow in them as it did during the flood. They are: <b>Beloa of Gader, and the hot springs of Tiberias, and the great spring of Beiram.</b> |
| Genesis 6:5 | evil all day” | Sukkah 52b:1 | <b>evil all day”</b> (Genesis 6:5). All day long his thoughts and desires are for evil. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: A person’s</b> evil <b>inclination overcomes him each day and seeks to kill him, as it stated: “The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to kill him”</b> (Psalms 37:32); the wicked here is referring to the wickedness inside one’s heart. <b>And if not for the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who assists</b> him with the good inclination, <b>he would not overcome it, as it is stated: “The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged”</b> (Psalms 37:33). |
| Genesis 6:6 | “ Vayyinaḥem the Lord that He made man on the earth [ ba’aretz ]” | Sanhedrin 108a:15 | It is written: <b>“<i>Vayyinaḥem</i> the Lord that He made man on the earth [<i>ba’aretz</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:6). The meaning of the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” is subject to a dispute. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> in explanation: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I did well that I prepared graves for</b> people <b>in the earth [<i>ba’aretz</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it <b>inferred</b> that the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” has a positive connotation? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written here: “<i>Vayyinaḥem</i>,” and it is written there: “And he comforted them [<i>vayenaḥem otam</i>] and spoke to their heart”</b> (Genesis 50:21). |
| Genesis 6:9 | without blemish” | Avodah Zarah51a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19). The term <b>“with you”</b> indicates that the verse is referring <b>to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> excluding a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> In that case, one cannot exclude a <i>tereifa</i> from the comparison of animals to Noah. The Gemara explains: <b>It is written about</b> Noah that he was “a man righteous and <b>without blemish”</b> (Genesis 6:9), indicating that he was physically whole. |
| Genesis 6:9 | “complete” | Avodah Zarah6a:1 | <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can give birth, what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be excluded by the phrase: “To keep seed alive.” The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the animals that were brought by Noah into the ark: “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19). The term “with you” indicates that the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> but not a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If so, one cannot exclude a <i>tereifa</i> from the comparison of animals to Noah. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written about</b> Noah that he was <b>“complete”</b> (Genesis 6:9). |
| Genesis 6:9 | “righteous” | Avodah Zarah6a:2 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse means that <b>his ways were complete,</b> but it is not referring to Noah’s physical attributes. The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> already <b>written about him</b> that he was <b>“righteous”</b> (Genesis 6:9), which means that his actions were perfect. Consequently, when the verse says that he was also complete, it must be referring to his body. |
| Genesis 6:9 | Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations, | Eruvin 18b:14 | <b>And all of it</b> may be said <b>not in his presence, as it is written:</b> “These are the generations of Noah; <b>Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations,</b> and Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9). When not referring to him in his presence, God refers to Noah as a righteous and perfect man. |
| Genesis 6:9 | “These are the generations of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, and wholehearted in his generations” | Sanhedrin 108a:17 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“These are the generations of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, and wholehearted in his generations”</b> (Genesis 6:9), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Relative to the other people <b>of his generation</b> he was righteous and wholehearted, <b>but not</b> relative to those <b>of other generations. And Reish Lakish says: In his generation</b> he was righteous and wholehearted despite being surrounded by bad influences; <b>all the more so</b> would he have been considered righteous and wholehearted <b>in other generations.</b> |
| Genesis 6:9 | “complete” | Zevachim 116a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If so, one cannot exclude a <i>tereifa</i> from the comparison of animals to Noah. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written about</b> Noah that he was <b>“complete”</b> (Genesis 6:9), which indicates that he was physically whole and unblemished. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse means that <b>his ways were complete,</b> and it is not referring to Noah’s physical attributes. The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> already <b>written about him</b> that he was <b>“righteous”</b> (Genesis 6:9), which means that his actions were perfect.

| Genesis 6:11 | as it is written: “And the earth was corrupt before God” | Sanhedrin 57a:1 | <b>as it is written: “And the earth was corrupt before God”</b> (Genesis 6:11), presumably referring to a transgression, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption refers to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is stated: “For all flesh had corrupted their way</b> upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse. <b>And</b> corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make</b> you a graven image” (Deuteronomy 4:16). |
| Genesis 6:12 | for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth” | Avodah Zarah23b:9 | The Gemara supports this claim: Corruption is a reference to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood: “And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12). <b>And</b> corruption also is a reference to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). <b>And consequently,</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer also, since a blemish disqualifies it, a matter of licentiousness and idol worship</b> likewise <b>disqualify it.</b> |
| Genesis 6:12 | for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth” | Bekhorot 57a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> supports this claim: Corruption is a reference to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood: “And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12). <b>And</b> corruption is also a reference to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). |
| Genesis 6:12 | matters of licentiousness, as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted [ hishḥit ] their way upon the earth” | Chullin 23a:2 | As it could <b>enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualified offerings: <b>“Because their corruption [<i>moshḥatam</i>] is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), referring to two types of disqualifications: Corruption and blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption [<i>hashḥata</i>] is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption is referring to <b>matters of licentiousness, as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted [<i>hishḥit</i>] their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse. |
| Genesis 6:12 | “For all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth” | Sanhedrin 108a:11 | With regard to the verse: <b>“For all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the people of the generation of the flood <b>mated</b> male <b>domesticated animals with</b> female <b>undomesticated animals, and</b> male <b>undomesticated animals with</b> female <b>domesticated animals, and all</b> male animals <b>with human</b> females, <b>and human</b> males <b>with all</b> female animals. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana says: And</b> after the flood <b>all of</b> the creatures <b>returned</b> to mate with their own species, <b>except</b> for the bird called <b><i>tushlami</i>,</b> which continued to mate with other species. |
| Genesis 6:12 | a matter of licentiousness, as it is stated: “For all flesh had corrupted their way | Sanhedrin 57a:1 | <b>as it is written: “And the earth was corrupt before God”</b> (Genesis 6:11), presumably referring to a transgression, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption refers to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is stated: “For all flesh had corrupted their way</b> upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse. <b>And</b> corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make</b> you a graven image” (Deuteronomy 4:16). |
| Genesis 6:12 | for all flesh had corrupted | Temurah 28b:17 | Corruption refers to <b>a matter of sexual immorality, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood, which was steeped in sexual immorality: “And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted</b> its way upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12). Corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image even the form of any figure”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). Since the term corruption is also used with regard to blemished animals, the following may be derived: In <b>any</b> case <b>in which a blemish disqualifies</b> an animal from the altar, <b>a matter of sexual immorality,</b> such as an animal that copulated with a person or an animal that was the object of bestiality, <b>or</b> their use as an object of <b>idol worship,</b> also <b>disqualifies them.</b> |
| Genesis 6:13 | “And God said to Noah: The end of all flesh is come before Me, | Sanhedrin 108a:12 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And God said to Noah: The end of all flesh is come before Me,</b> for the earth is filled with robbery through them, and behold, I will destroy them with the earth” (Genesis 6:13), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Come and see how great is the power of robbery, as the generation of the flood violated every</b> precept, <b>but their sentence</b> to be destroyed <b>was not sealed until they extended their hands</b> and engaged <b>in robbery, as it is stated: “For the earth is filled with robbery through them, and behold, I will destroy them with the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:13). <b>And it is written: “Robbery is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nothing comes from them, nor from their multitude, nor from any of them, nor shall there be wailing [<i>no’ah</i>] for them”</b> (Ezekiel 7:11). |
| Genesis 6:14 | “Make you an ark of gopher wood” | Sanhedrin 108b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“Make you an ark of gopher wood”</b> (Genesis 6:14), the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>gopher</b> wood? <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rabbi Sheila: This</b> is wood from the <b><i>mavliga</i></b> tree; <b>and some say</b> that it is wood from the <b>willow [<i>gulamish</i>]</b> tree. |
| Genesis 6:16 | “And to a cubit you shall finish it above” | Sanhedrin 108b:10 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And to a cubit you shall finish it above”</b> (Genesis 6:16), the Gemara explains <b>that in that manner,</b> having been built wide at its base and narrow at its top, the ark would <b>stand</b> upright and would not capsize. |
| Genesis 6:16 | “With lower, second and third stories shall you make it” | Sanhedrin 108b:11 | With regard to the verse: <b>“With lower, second and third stories shall you make it”</b> (Genesis 6:16), it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The bottom</b> story was <b>for manure, the middle</b> story was <b>for animals, and the top</b> story was <b>for people.</b> |
| Genesis 6:16 | “A tzohar you shall make for the ark” | Sanhedrin 108b:9 | With regard to the verse: <b>“A <i>tzohar</i> you shall make for the ark”</b> (Genesis 6:16), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Noah: Set precious stones and jewels in</b> the ark <b>so that they will shine for you as the afternoon [<i>tzohorayim</i>]</b> sun. |

The members of the generation of the flood <b>said: Do we need Him for anything, even for</b> the <b>drop of rain</b> that He causes to fall? <b>We have rivers and springs from which we take our supply</b> of water; we do not fear Him. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: With the goodness that I bestowed upon them, with</b> that <b>they infuriate Me and with it I will sentence them, as it is stated: “And behold I will bring the flood of water”</b> (Genesis 6:17). |
| Genesis 6:18 | which is written: “And you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you” | Sanhedrin 108b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it was prohibited</b> for them to engage in intercourse while in the ark? The Gemara answers: It is derived from that <b>which is written: “And you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 6:18); <b>and it is written: “Emerge from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 8:16). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From here,</b> the Sages derived and <b>said that it was prohibited</b> to engage <b>in intercourse</b> while in the ark, as when Noah and his family entered, the husbands and wives were listed separately, and when they emerged, the husbands were listed with their wives. |
| Genesis 6:19 | as it is stated: “And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every | Avodah Zarah51a:15 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one who slaughters a blemished animal in idolatrous worship is exempt is stated <b>with regard to</b> an animal that is <b>lacking a limb, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar.

This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every</b> sort you shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you” (Genesis 6:19). <b>The Torah stated:</b> “Of every living thing,” indicating that Noah should <b>bring</b> into the ark <b>an animal whose extremities are living,</b> as some of the animals would subsequently be used as offerings. |
| Genesis 6:19 | with you” | Avodah Zarah51a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19). The term <b>“with you”</b> indicates that the verse is referring <b>to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> excluding a <i>tereifa</i>.

| Genesis 6:19 | “And of every living being of all flesh, | Zevachim 116a:3 | The Gemara adds: That which was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Unblemished and blemished</b> animals, serves <b>to exclude</b> animals that are <b>lacking a limb, which</b> were <b>not</b> fit for sacrifice. As <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> an animal that is <b>lacking a limb is forbidden to the descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles, to be used as a sacrifice? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And of every living being of all flesh,</b> two of every sort shall you bring into the ark” (Genesis 6:19). With regard to the phrase: “And of every living being,” which is superfluous, <b>the Torah stated: Bring an animal whose limbs are</b> all <b>living,</b> not one lacking a limb, as that animal is disqualified from sacrifice. |
| Genesis 6:19 | with you” | Zevachim 116a:5 | The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot give birth.</b> In this case the disqualification of the <i>tereifa</i> is derived from the verse: “To keep seed alive,” while the disqualification of the animal lacking a limb is derived from the verse: “And of every living being.” <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can give birth, what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be excluded by the phrase: “To keep seed alive.” The Gemara explains: <b>Doesn’t the verse state</b> with regard to the animals that were brought by Noah into the ark: “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19)? The term “with you” indicates that the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> not a <i>tereifa</i>. |
| Genesis 6:20 | as it is written: “Of the fowl after their kind | Sanhedrin 57a:7 | The prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> that applies to the descendants of Noah is stated, <b>as it is written: “Of the fowl after their kind</b> and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind” (Genesis 6:20), indicating that each species must be kept separate, and that crossbreeding is prohibited. <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>that</b> verse does not indicate a mitzva; rather, the reason for keeping the species separate in Noah’s Ark was <b>merely for</b> the sake of <b>companionship,</b> as animals are most comfortable in the company of other members of their own species. |
| Genesis 7:1 | for you have I seen righteous before Me in this generation” | Eruvin 18b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> further <b>said:</b> Only <b>some of a person’s praise should be said in his presence, and all of it</b> may be said <b>not in his presence.</b> Only <b>some of his praise should be said in his presence, as it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Noah, come, you and all your house into the ark, <b>for you have I seen righteous before Me in this generation”</b> (Genesis 7:1). |
| Genesis 7:2 | “Of every kosher animal you shall take to you by sevens, husband and wife” | Sanhedrin 108b:6 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“Of every kosher animal you shall take to you by sevens, husband and wife”</b> (Genesis 7:2), the Gemara asks: <b>Is there marriage for animals? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The reference is to <b>those</b> animals <b>with which</b> the <b>transgression</b> of relations with another species <b>was not performed.</b> Therefore, the Torah underscores that the animals that entered the ark were husband and wife. |
| Genesis 7:3 | to keep seed alive | Avodah Zarah51a:16 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“And of every living thing,” required to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which is disqualified as an offering? The Gemara answers: The disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>derived from</b> the verse: “Of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female, <b>to keep seed alive</b> upon the face of all the earth” (Genesis 7:3), as a <i>tereifa</i> cannot procreate. |
| Genesis 7:3 | “To keep seed alive” | Avodah Zarah5b:11 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>that</b> verse <b>required</b> to teach <b>that an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>] is not</b> fit to be sacrificed as an offering? The Gemara answers: The disqualification of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“To keep seed alive”</b> (Genesis 7:3), as a <i>tereifa</i> cannot propagate. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot give birth.</b> According to this opinion, the disqualification of a missing limb is derived from the phrase: “Of every living thing,” while the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> is learned from the phrase: “To keep seed alive.” |
| Genesis 7:3 | “To keep seed alive” | Zevachim 116a:4 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> this phrase: “And of every living being,” serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being fit as a sacrifice. The Gemara explains: The disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“To keep seed alive”</b> (Genesis 7:3), as a <i>tereifa</i> cannot propagate. |
| Genesis 7:6 | Shem was two years older than Japheth. And it is written: “And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth” | Sanhedrin 69b:15 | <b>Know</b> that it is true <b>that the verse</b> sometimes <b>lists</b> brothers not according to their birth order, but <b>in the order of their</b> degrees of <b>wisdom, as it is written: “And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth”</b> (Genesis 5:32). According to this, <b>Shem was</b> at least <b>one year older than Ham, and Ham one year older than Japheth,</b> so <b>it turns out</b> that <b>Shem was two years older than Japheth. And it is written: “And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 7:6). <b>And it is written: “These are the descendants of Shem; Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood”</b> (Genesis 11:10). If Shem was the oldest brother, how could he be only <b>100 years old? He must have been</b> at least <b>102 years old,</b> as Noah was 500 years old when his third son was born, and he was 600 years old at the time of the flood. |
| Genesis 7:8 | a non-kosher animal, as it is written: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are lacking purity” | Bava Batra123a:14 | The Gemara explains this answer: <b>What</b> does it mean that <b>Leah advanced</b> ahead of Rachel <b>with mercy? As it is written: “And Leah’s eyes were weak [<i>rakkot</i>]”</b> (Genesis 29:17). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>rakkot</i>”? If we say</b> that her eyes were <b>literally weak,</b> is it <b>possible</b> that the verse would say that? <b>The verse</b> there <b>did not speak to the disparagement of</b> even <b>a non-kosher animal, as it is written: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are lacking purity”</b> (Genesis 7:8). The verse states: “That are lacking purity” rather than stating explicitly and disparagingly: That are impure. If that is so with regard to animals, <b>did the verse speak</b> here <b>to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term alludes to the fact <b>that her gifts,</b> i.e., the gifts given to her descendants, e.g., the priesthood and the monarchy, <b>were long-lasting [<i>arukkot</i>],</b> as they were passed down from generation to generation. |
| Genesis 7:8 | express a crude matter, as it is stated: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure [ asher einena tehora ]” | Pesachim 3a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, <b>what is the reason</b> that he <b>didn’t</b> explicitly <b>teach: The night</b> of the fourteenth, as it was taught in the school of Shmuel? The Gemara answers: <b>He employed a euphemism.</b> Since the <i>tanna</i> of our mishna did not want to mention darkness, he preferred the term <i>or</i> to refer to the night of the fourteenth. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A person should never express a crude matter, as the</b> formulation of <b>a verse</b> was <b>distorted</b> by the addition of <b>eight letters rather than</b> have it <b>express a crude matter, as it is stated: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure [<i>asher einena tehora</i>]”</b> (Genesis 7:8). To avoid using the Hebrew term for impure [<i>teme’a</i>], which is four letters: <i>Tet</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>alef</i>, <i>heh</i>, the verse replaced the term with the euphemism meaning “that are not pure,” which is spelled with twelve letters: <i>Alef</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>reish</i>; <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>heh</i>. |
| Genesis 7:10 | “And it came to pass that after seven days the waters of the flood were upon the earth” | Sanhedrin 108b:4 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And it came to pass that after seven days the waters of the flood were upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 7:10), the Gemara asks: <b>What is the nature of</b> these <b>seven</b> additional <b>days?</b> |
| Genesis 7:11 | “In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, | Rosh Hashanah11b:6 | <b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning,</b> as they disagreed about this same issue in another context as well. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,</b> on that day were all the fountains of the great deep broken open, and the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: That day was the seventeenth of Iyyar,</b> the second month of the year counting from Nisan, which is <b>the day that the constellation of <i>Kima</i> sets during the day and</b> the season that <b>the springs diminish</b> with the increased heat. <b>But because</b> the people of the generation of the flood <b>changed their actions</b> for the worse, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, changed for them the acts of Creation, and</b> instead of <i>Kima</i> setting, <b>He caused the constellation of <i>Kima</i> to rise during the day and He removed two stars from <i>Kima</i>, and</b> in this way <b>He brought a flood to the world.</b> |
| Genesis 7:11 | says: “And the windows of the heavens were opened” | Sanhedrin 100b:1 | <b>You must say that the attribute of reward is greater than the attribute of punishment,</b> as <b>with regard to the attribute of reward it is written: “He commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, and rained upon them manna to eat”</b> (Psalms 78:23–24). <b>And with regard to the attribute of punishment</b> at the time of the flood the verse <b>says: “And the windows of the heavens were opened”</b> (Genesis 7:11). To mete out punishment, God opened only windows, which are considerably smaller openings than doors, indicating that the attribute of reward is greater. |
| Genesis 7:11 | And they were punished with great, as it is stated: “All the fountains of the great deep | Sanhedrin 108a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The members of <b>the generation of the flood sinned with “great” and were punished with “great.” They sinned with “great,” as it is stated: “And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great”</b> (Genesis 6:5). <b>And they were punished with great, as it is stated: “All the fountains of the great deep</b> were breached” (Genesis 7:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three</b> fountains <b>of</b> the great deep that were breached in the flood <b>remained,</b> and boiling water continues to flow in them as it did during the flood. They are: <b>Beloa of Gader, and the hot springs of Tiberias, and the great spring of Beiram.</b> |
| Genesis 7:11 | punished them with water, which is similar to an eyeball [ legalgal ha’ayin ], as it is stated: “All the fountains [ mayenot ] of the great deep were breached, and the flues of heaven were opened” | Sanhedrin 108a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The generation of the flood became haughty due only to the</b> covetousness of the <b>eyeball, which is similar to water, as it is stated:</b> “And the sons of the prominent men saw that the daughters of men were fair; <b>and they took for themselves wives from anyone they chose”</b> (Genesis 6:2). <b>Consequently,</b> God <b>punished them with water, which is similar to an eyeball [<i>legalgal ha’ayin</i>], as it is stated: “All the fountains [<i>mayenot</i>] of the great deep were breached, and the flues of heaven were opened”</b> (Genesis 7:11). |
| Genesis 7:11 | “opening” | Yoma 76a:10 | The Gemara asks how Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i can compare the depth of the Flood waters with the amount of manna that fell in the desert: <b>This is not similar,</b> and the calculation is inaccurate. <b>There,</b> in the case of the Flood, the water rose fifteen cubits in <b>forty days;</b> but <b>here,</b> in the case of the manna, it took only <b>one hour</b> every day to fall. Conversely, <b>there</b> the Flood was <b>for everyone</b> and covered the whole world; whereas <b>here</b> the manna <b>was for the Jewish people alone. And there</b> would be <b>much more</b> manna <b>for them</b> than sixty cubits, which is the measurement put forth by Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i derived “opening”</b> in the verse: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven” (Psalms 78:23), from <b>“opening”</b> in the verse: “And the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11). He used a verbal analogy that teaches that the skies opened in both instances in the same way. |
| Genesis 7:11 | Rather: “On the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up” | Yoma 76a:6 | <b>He said to him: Rabbi, I am interpreting a verse.</b> How so? It states about the Flood: <b>“Fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered”</b> (Genesis 7:20). <b>Is it possible that it would be fifteen cubits</b> high <b>from a valley, fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the plain,</b> and <b>fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the mountains? Did the water stand as though in layers,</b> conforming to the height of the land below it? <b>Furthermore, how could the Ark travel</b> over water that was at different levels? <b>Rather: “On the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up”</b> (Genesis 7:11), <b>until the water</b> rose and <b>was level with the mountains. Afterward,</b> the verse states that <b>“fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail.”</b> |
| Genesis 7:11 | states: “And the windows of heaven were opened” | Yoma 76a:7 | Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i continues: <b>But which attribute is greater, the attribute of goodness or the attribute of retribution? One must say the attribute of goodness</b> is greater <b>than the attribute of retribution. With regard to the attribute of retribution,</b> in the case of the Flood, the verse <b>states: “And the windows of heaven were opened”</b> (Genesis 7:11), which indicates that there were only windows. Whereas, <b>with regard to the attribute of goodness,</b> in the case of the manna, the verse <b>states: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven, and rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them heavenly grain”</b> (Psalms 78:23–24). |
| Genesis 7:14 | “Every bird [ tzippor ] of every type of wing” | Chullin 139b:19 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the verse about the animals that entered Noah’s ark: <b>“Every bird [<i>tzippor</i>] of every type of wing”</b> (Genesis 7:14). <b>What, is it not</b> the same <b>difficulty that we posed</b> previously, that the word “<i>tzippor</i>” is referring to all birds, kosher and non-kosher, and the word “wing” is referring to grasshoppers? The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>No,</b> it is actually <b>as we resolved</b> it, that the word “<i>tzippor</i>” is referring only to kosher birds, and the word “wing” is referring to non-kosher birds and to grasshoppers. |
| Genesis 7:16 | male and female | Zevachim 116a:11 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> there is a different explanation as to how Noah knew which animals were pure or impure. <b>The verse states: “And they that went in,</b> went in <b>male and female</b> of all flesh” (Genesis 7:16), which means: Those <b>that went in on their own.</b> Consequently, Noah did not need to distinguish between pure and impure animals, as only the pure ones approached. |
| Genesis 7:20 | “Fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered” | Yoma 76a:6 | <b>He said to him: Rabbi, I am interpreting a verse.</b> How so? It states about the Flood: <b>“Fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered”</b> (Genesis 7:20). <b>Is it possible that it would be fifteen cubits</b> high <b>from a valley, fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the plain,</b> and <b>fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the mountains? Did the water stand as though in layers,</b> conforming to the height of the land below it? <b>Furthermore, how could the Ark travel</b> over water that was at different levels? <b>Rather: “On the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up”</b> (Genesis 7:11), <b>until the water</b> rose and <b>was level with the mountains. Afterward,</b> the verse states that <b>“fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail.”</b> |
| Genesis 7:21 | the generation of the flood | Bava Batra16b:15 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Ishmael repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime? From</b> the incident involving <b>Ravina and Rav Ḥama bar Buzi,</b> who <b>were sitting before Rava, and Rava was dozing</b> while they were talking. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ḥama bar Buzi: Is it true that you say</b> that <b>any death with regard to which</b> the word <b><i>gevia</i>,</b> expire, is mentioned <b>is the death of the righteous?</b> Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: Yes.</b> For example: “And Isaac expired [<i>vayyigva</i>], and died” (Genesis 35:29). Ravina objected: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the generation of the flood</b> it states: “And all flesh expired [<i>vayyigva</i>]” (Genesis 7:21), and there they died for their wickedness. Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: We say</b> this only when both <b><i>gevia</i> and <i>asifa</i>,</b> gathering, are used; when these two terms are mentioned together they indicate the death of a righteous person. |
| Genesis 7:22 | “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life” | Bekhorot 46b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Shmuel’s ruling? The verse states: <b>“All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life”</b> (Genesis 7:22), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that</b> one has <b>the breath of the spirit of life,</b> i.e., if it is viable, one goes <b>by its nostrils,</b> i.e., <b>its head is considered significant.</b> But with regard to <b>another</b> offspring, one that is not viable, <b>its head is not considered significant.</b> |
| Genesis 7:22 | whereas in the generation of the flood the decree was not imposed upon the fish in the sea, as it is stated: “Whatever was on dry land died” | Kiddushin 13a:14 | <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Therefore the land mourns and everyone who dwells there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea are also taken away”</b> (Hosea 4:3). This indicates that those who cause illegitimate children to be born lead to such a great tragedy that even the fish of the sea will die, <b>whereas in the generation of the flood the decree was not imposed upon the fish in the sea, as it is stated: “Whatever was on dry land died”</b> (Genesis 7:22). The explicit mention of dry land indicates that <b>the fish in the sea did not</b> die. <b>But here,</b> in the punishment described in the verses in Hosea, <b>even the fish in the sea</b> died. |
| Genesis 7:22 | “Of all that was on dry land died” | Sanhedrin 108a:21 | It is written: <b>“Of all that was on dry land died”</b> (Genesis 7:22), from which it is inferred: <b>But not the fish that are in the sea,</b> which are not on dry land. |
| Genesis 7:22 | it is in his nose, as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life” | Sotah 45b:17 | The Gemara refutes this comparison: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that both <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna agree with <b>Abba Shaul,</b> as <b>Abba Shaul says</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to the forming</b> of an embryo, <b>that when an embryo is formed,</b> it is <b>formed from its middle. But with regard to life, everyone,</b> i.e., both <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, agree that <b>it is in his nose, as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life”</b> (Genesis 7:22). |
| Genesis 7:22 | life is in the nose, as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life” | Yoma 85a:11 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the formation of a fetus from the navel is the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul,</b> he may nevertheless require one to check the nose for signs of life. <b>Until now, Abba Shaul spoke there only about formation,</b> saying <b>that everything is created from its middle; however, as for saving a life, even Abba Shaul admits that the main</b> sign of <b>life is in the nose, as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life”</b> (Genesis 7:22). |
| Genesis 7:22 | as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life” | Yoma 85a:12 | <b>Rav Pappa said: The dispute</b> with regard to how far to check for signs of life applies when the digger begins removing the rubble <b>from below,</b> starting with the feet, <b>to above.</b> In such a case it is insufficient to check until his heart; rather, one must continue removing rubble until he is able to check his nose for breath. <b>But</b> if one cleared the rubble <b>from above to below, once he checked as far as</b> the victim’s <b>nose he is not required</b> to check further, <b>as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life”</b> (Genesis 7:22). |
| Genesis 7:22 | whatsoever was on the dry land, died” | Zevachim 113b:3 | Reish Lakish <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: With regard to the flood, it is stated: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, <b>whatsoever was on the dry land, died”</b> (Genesis 7:22). <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> the <b>flood descended upon Eretz Yisrael, due to that</b> reason all living creatures on Earth <b>died,</b> even those in Eretz Yisrael. <b>But according to your</b> opinion that the flood did not descend on Eretz Yisrael, <b>why did they die</b> there? Rabbi Yoḥanan responds: They died <b>due to the heat</b> that accompanied the floodwaters, and that spread to Eretz Yisrael as well. Those corpses were then buried in known locations. |
| Genesis 7:22 | “whatsoever was on the dry land, died” | Zevachim 113b:5 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this discussion should be inverted, and in fact <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from that verse: It is stated that <b>“whatsoever was on the dry land, died”</b> (Genesis 7:22). <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> that the <b>flood did not descend upon Eretz Yisrael, due to that</b> reason, <b>there was</b> an area of <b>dry land</b> even during the flood, and all living creatures there died from the heat. <b>But according to your</b> opinion that the flood did descend upon Eretz Yisrael, <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>“dry land”?</b> There was no dry land anywhere. Reish Lakish responds: The verse is referring to <b>land that had been dry initially,</b> before the flood. |
| Genesis 7:22 | of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says: During the generation of the flood no decree was decreed upon the fish in the sea, as it is stated: “Whatsoever was on the dry land, died” | Zevachim 113b:6 | <b>And why</b> does the Torah <b>call it “dry land”</b> during the flood? There was no dry land during the flood. It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says: During the generation of the flood no decree was decreed upon the fish in the sea, as it is stated: “Whatsoever was on the dry land, died”</b> (Genesis 7:22), i.e., only those creatures that had been on dry land, <b>but not</b> the <b>fish in the sea.</b> |
| Genesis 7:23 | the punishment of the flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, | Berakhot 61a:11 | <b>Rather,</b> this refers to <b>the punishment of the flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,</b> creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23); the punishment <b>began with man, then the animals,</b> and ultimately all the other creatures. |
| Genesis 7:23 | Flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, | Eruvin 18a:19 | <b>Rather,</b> this refers <b>to</b> the punishment of the <b>Flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,</b> creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23). This indicates that the punishment began with man. |
| Genesis 7:23 | “And He obliterated every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, | Sanhedrin 108a:19 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And He obliterated every living thing that was upon the face of the ground,</b> from man to cattle to creeping animal to the birds of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23), the Gemara asks: <b>If man sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>did</b> the <b>animal</b> kingdom <b>sin</b> that it, too, warranted destruction? |
| Genesis 7:23 | the generation of the flood have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And He obliterated every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, | Sanhedrin 108a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The members of <b>the generation of the flood have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And He obliterated every living thing that was upon the face of the ground,</b> from man to cattle to creeping animal to the birds of the heaven; and they were obliterated from the earth” (Genesis 7:23). <b>“And He obliterated every living thing”</b> indicates <b>in this world,</b> whereas <b>“and they were obliterated from the earth”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> The members of the generation of the flood will <b>neither live nor be judged, as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [<i>yadon</i>] in man forever”</b> (Genesis 6:3), meaning <b>neither</b> will they stand in <b>judgment [<i>din</i>], nor</b> shall their <b>souls</b> be restored to them. <b>Alternatively, “My soul shall not abide”</b> means <b>their souls will not return to their sheaths [<i>nadan</i>],</b> i.e., to their bodies. |
| Genesis 7:23 | And some say: It is as if he eats abominations and creeping creatures, as it is written: “And He wiped out all that existed | Shabbat 113b:3 | And <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei: What is</b> the ruling with regard to <b>eating earth</b> for medicinal purposes <b>on Shabbat?</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: And during the week is it permitted</b> to eat soil? <b>As I say: Even during the week it is prohibited because it is harmful. Rabbi Ami said: Anyone who eats the dust of Babylonia, it is as if he is eating the flesh of his ancestors</b> buried there. <b>And some say: It is as if he eats abominations and creeping creatures, as it is written: “And He wiped out all that existed</b> on the face of the earth, from humans to animals, to creeping creatures to the birds in the sky, and they were wiped off the land” (Genesis 7:23). |
| Genesis 8:1 | “And the waters abated” | Rosh Hashanah12a:4 | The Gemara answers: Even according to Rabbi Eliezer a change was made, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: They sinned with boiling</b> heat, <b>and they were punished with boiling</b> heat; <b>they sinned with the boiling</b> heat <b>of the sin</b> of forbidden sexual relations, <b>and they were punished with the boiling</b> heat of scalding waters. This is derived from a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the flood: <b>“And the waters abated”</b> (Genesis 8:1), <b>and it is written elsewhere,</b> with regard to King Ahasuerus: <b>“And the heated</b> anger <b>of the king abated”</b> (Esther 7:10), which implies that the word “abated” means cooled. This indicates that at first the waters of the flood had been scalding hot. |
| Genesis 8:1 | “And the waters assuaged” | Sanhedrin 108b:3 | Noah <b>said to them:</b> If He wishes <b>He will bring</b> the water <b>from between your feet</b> and you can do nothing to prevent it, <b>as it is stated: “For them whose foot slips.” It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The waters of the flood were</b> as <b>hard</b> and thick <b>as semen, as it is stated: “For them whose foot slips”;</b> foot is a euphemism. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: With hot</b> semen <b>they sinned, and with hot</b> water <b>they were punished.</b> As <b>it is written here,</b> at the conclusion of the flood: <b>“And the waters assuaged”</b> (Genesis 8:1), <b>and it is written there: “Then the king’s wrath was assuaged”</b> (Esther 7:10). Just as the term “assuaged” there is referring to the heat of Ahasuerus’s wrath, so too, “assuaged” with regard to the flood is referring to the heat of the waters. |
| Genesis 8:1 | and the waters calmed [ vayashoku hamayim ]” | Zevachim 113b:4 | The Gemara notes that this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The generation of the flood <b>sinned with boiling</b> heat, i.e., forbidden sexual intercourse, <b>and they were punished with</b> the <b>boiling</b> heat of the flood waters. <b>As it is written here,</b> with regard to the flood: “And God remembered Noah and every living creature and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth <b>and the waters calmed [<i>vayashoku hamayim</i>]”</b> (Genesis 8:1); <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to the execution of Haman: “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. <b>Then the king’s boiling anger was assuaged [<i>shakhakha</i>]”</b> (Esther 7:10). This latter verse indicates that a matter is assuaged from heat; similarly, the flood waters were hot. |
| Genesis 8:7 | “And he sent forth the raven, | Sanhedrin 108b:12 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And he sent forth the raven,</b> which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from the earth” (Genesis 8:7), <b>Reish Lakish says: The raven</b> provided <b>a convincing response to Noah;</b> when it did not wish to leave the ark the raven <b>said to him: Your Master,</b> God, <b>hates me, and you hate me. Your Master hates me,</b> as He commanded to take <b>from the kosher</b> species <b>seven</b> and <b>from the non-kosher</b> species <b>two. And you hate me, as you disregard</b> those <b>from the species of seven,</b> i.e., the kosher birds, <b>and</b> instead <b>dispatch</b> one <b>from the species of two,</b> i.e., the non-kosher birds. <b>If the angel of heat or the angel of cold harms me</b> and kills me, <b>will the world not be lacking one</b> species of <b>creature,</b> as there was only one pair of ravens? <b>Or perhaps</b> you are sending me because it is <b>my wife</b> that <b>you need,</b> in order to engage in intercourse with her. |
| Genesis 8:8 | “And he sent forth the dove from him, to see if the waters abated” | Sanhedrin 108b:16 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And he sent forth the dove from him, to see if the waters abated”</b> (Genesis 8:8), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: From here</b> it is derived <b>that the dwelling place of kosher birds</b> in the ark was <b>with the righteous</b> people, as the verse emphasizes that Noah dispatched the dove from his place. |
| Genesis 8:11 | and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf, plucked off [ taraf ]; | Eruvin 18b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the dove came in to him in the evening, <b>and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf, plucked off [<i>taraf</i>];</b> so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth” (Genesis 8:11)? <b>The dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let my food be bitter as an olive but given into Your hand, and let it not be sweet as honey but dependent upon flesh and blood.</b> He adds this explanation: <b>Here it is written: <i>Taraf</i>. And there it is written:</b> “Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; <b>feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Genesis 8:11 | “And in her mouth was an olive branch plucked off [ taraf ]” | Sanhedrin 108b:17 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And in her mouth was an olive branch plucked off [<i>taraf</i> ]”</b> (Genesis 8:11), <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, may my sustenance be bitter as the olive and dependent on Your hands, and not sweet as honey and dependent on the hands of flesh and blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that <i>taraf</i> is a term</b> that indicates <b>sustenance?</b> The Gemara answers: It is inferred from that <b>which is written: “Feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] with my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Genesis 8:13 | “And it came to pass in the one and six hundredth year, in the first month on the first day of the month, | Rosh Hashanah10b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, who disagree about how much time must pass to count as a year, <b>expounded the same verse.</b> As the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass in the one and six hundredth year, in the first month on the first day of the month,</b> that the waters were dried up from off the earth” (Genesis 8:13). <b>Rabbi Meir holds: From the fact that it was</b> only <b>one day into the year,</b> as it was still the first day of the first month, <b>and</b> yet <b>it is called the</b> six hundred and first <b>year, learn from here</b> that <b>one day in a year is</b> already <b>considered a year.</b> |
| Genesis 8:16 | and it is written: “Emerge from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you” | Sanhedrin 108b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it was prohibited</b> for them to engage in intercourse while in the ark? The Gemara answers: It is derived from that <b>which is written: “And you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 6:18); <b>and it is written: “Emerge from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 8:16). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From here,</b> the Sages derived and <b>said that it was prohibited</b> to engage <b>in intercourse</b> while in the ark, as when Noah and his family entered, the husbands and wives were listed separately, and when they emerged, the husbands were listed with their wives. |
| Genesis 8:19 | “After their kinds [ lemishpeḥoteihem ], they emerged from the ark” | Sanhedrin 108b:18 | With regard to the verse: <b>“After their kinds [<i>lemishpeḥoteihem</i>], they emerged from the ark”</b> (Genesis 8:19), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: After their kinds [<i>lemishpeḥotam</i>]</b> the animals emerged, <b>but not them [<i>hem</i>]</b> themselves, as some of the animals that entered the ark died during that year and it was their descendants who emerged. |
| Genesis 8:20 | Rav Huna says: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei? As it is written: “And Noah built an altar to the Lord, | Zevachim 108b:15 | § The mishna teaches: Rabbi Yosei says: <b>And</b> one is <b>liable</b> for offering up an offering outside the courtyard <b>only once he offers</b> it <b>up</b> upon the top of an altar that was erected there. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if he offered it up on a rock or on a stone, not an altar, he is liable. <b>Rav Huna says: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei? As it is written: “And Noah built an altar to the Lord,</b> and took of every pure animal, and of every pure bird, and offered up burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). Noah was particular to use an altar rather than one of the available rocks. Apparently, this was because placing an item upon an altar is the only act that can be considered offering up. |
| Genesis 8:20 | “And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every pure animal, and of every pure fowl, | Zevachim 115b:18 | § <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Before the Tabernacle was established, <b>all</b> animals were <b>fit to be sacrificed:</b> A domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Huna said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the offering that was sacrificed after the flood: <b>“And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every pure animal, and of every pure fowl,</b> and offered burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). The Gemara explains: <b>“Animal [<i>behema</i>],”</b> is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> a domesticated animal, and the same is true of fowl; <b>an undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>]</b> is <b>included in</b> the term <b>“<i>behema</i>”</b> that is stated in the verse. |
| Genesis 8:20 | a domesticated animal is juxtaposed with a bird, | Zevachim 116a:2 | <b>And</b> in the verses that recount Noah’s sacrifices upon exiting the ark, <b>a domesticated animal is juxtaposed with a bird,</b> in the verse: “Of every pure animal, and of every pure fowl” (Genesis 8:20), which teaches that kosher animals had a status identical to that of birds, and could be sacrificed whether male or female, unblemished or blemished. |
| Genesis 8:20 | non-kosher | Zevachim 116a:9 | § The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that before the Tabernacle was constructed, sacrifices were brought from animals and birds that were <b>kosher, but not</b> from <b>non-kosher</b> species. This is based on the verse that describes what Noah sacrificed when he exited the ark: “And he took of every pure animal and of every pure fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). The Gemara asks: <b>And were there pure and impure</b> species <b>at that time,</b> during the period of Noah? The distinction between pure, i.e., kosher species, and impure, i.e., non-kosher species, was introduced only after the Torah was given (see Leviticus, chapter 11). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The pure animals that Noah took were <b>from those that had not been used in the performance of sin.</b> |
| Genesis 8:21 | the evil [ ra ] inclination, as it is stated: “For the inclination of the heart of man is evil [ ra ]” | Chagigah 16a:15 | Apropos this Sage, the Gemara cites another statement of his: <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Naḥmani, the disseminator</b> of <b>Reish Lakish, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Trust not in a companion, do not put your confidence in an intimate friend”</b> (Micah 7:5)? <b>If the evil inclination says to you: Sin, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, will forgive, do not trust</b> it, <b>since it is stated: “Trust not in a companion [<i>rei’a</i>].” And <i>rei’a</i> is referring to none other</b> than <b>the evil [<i>ra</i>] inclination, as it is stated: “For the inclination of the heart of man is evil [<i>ra</i>]”</b> (Genesis 8:21). |
| Genesis 8:21 | as it is stated: “And the Lord smelled the sweet savor, | Eruvin 65a:18 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever is appeased by his wine,</b> i.e., whoever becomes more relaxed after drinking, <b>has in him</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of his Creator,</b> who acted in a similar fashion, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord smelled the sweet savor,</b> and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake” (Genesis 8:21). As it were, God acted more favorably toward His creatures after He was appeased with the smell of the burnt offerings. Smell can be as potent as drinking or eating itself. |
| Genesis 8:21 | difficult is the evil inclination that even its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth” | Kiddushin 30b:6 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> So <b>difficult is the evil inclination that even its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Rav Yitzḥak says: A person’s</b> evil <b>inclination renews itself to him every day, as it is stated:</b> “And that every inclination of the thoughts in his heart was <b>only evil all day [<i>kol hayyom</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:5). “<i>Kol hayyom</i>” can also be understood as: Every day. |
| Genesis 8:21 | Rabbi Avira, and some say Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, taught: The evil inclination has seven names. The Holy One, Blessed be He, called it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth” | Sukkah 52a:7 | § <b>Rabbi Avira, and some say Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, taught: The evil inclination has seven names. The Holy One, Blessed be He, called it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Moses called it uncircumcised, as it is stated: “And circumcise the foreskin of your hearts”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16). <b>David called it impure, as it is stated: “Create for me a pure heart, O God”</b> (Psalms 51:12); <b>by inference, there is an impure</b> heart that is the evil inclination. |
| Genesis 8:22 | raises an objection | Bava Metzia106b:5 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “While the earth remains, planting and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22). The <i>baraita</i> interprets this verse as referring to six seasons of the year: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and similarly, Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya would say in accordance with his statement:</b> The second <b>half of Tishrei,</b> all of <b>Marḥeshvan, and</b> the first <b>half of Kislev</b> are the days of <b>planting.</b> |
| Genesis 8:23 | as it is stated: “And day and night shall not cease” | Sanhedrin 58b:25 | <b>And Reish Lakish says: A gentile who observed Shabbat is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>as it is stated: “And day and night shall not cease”</b> (Genesis 8:23), which literally means: And day and night they shall not rest. This is interpreted homiletically to mean that the descendants of Noah may not take a day of rest. <b>And the Master said</b> (57a) that <b>their prohibition is their death</b> penalty, i.e., the punishment for any prohibition with regard to descendants of Noah is execution. <b>Ravina says:</b> If a descendant of Noah observes a day of rest on any day of the week, <b>even</b> one not set aside for religious worship, e.g., <b>on a Monday,</b> he is liable. |
| Genesis 9:2 | him from a weasel or from mice, as it is stated: “And the fear of you and the dread of you [ ḥittekhem ] shall be | Shabbat 151b:9 | <b>And it was</b> also <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: It is not necessary to protect a live day-old baby from a weasel or from mice,</b> for they run away from the baby. <b>But</b> if <b>Og, the king of Bashan,</b> is <b>dead, it is necessary to protect</b> even <b>him from a weasel or from mice, as it is stated: “And the fear of you and the dread of you [<i>ḥittekhem</i>] shall be</b> upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens” (Genesis 9:2). The Gemara explains: <b>As long as a person is alive [<i>ḥai</i>], he is feared by the animals. Once he dies, he is no longer feared.</b> |
| Genesis 9:3 | like the green herbs I have given you all” | Sanhedrin 57a:4 | The prohibition of <b>robbery</b> is stated, according to the school of Menashe, <b>as it is written:</b> “Every moving thing that is alive shall be for food for you; <b>like the green herbs I have given you all”</b> (Genesis 9:3). <b>And Rabbi Levi says: Like the green herbs</b> that sprout all over by themselves and are ownerless, <b>and not like the vegetation of a garden,</b> which belongs to the garden’s owner alone. This indicates that robbery is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the other</b> <i>tanna’im</i> interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to permit</b> the consumption of <b>meat.</b> |
| Genesis 9:3 | as the green herb I have given you all” | Sanhedrin 59b:14 | <b>But when the children of Noah came,</b> God <b>permitted them</b> to eat meat; <b>as it is stated:</b> “Every moving thing that lives shall be for food for you; <b>as the green herb I have given you all”</b> (Genesis 9:3). One <b>might</b> have thought that accordingly, even the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>does not apply to</b> the descendants of Noah; therefore <b>the verse states: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4). One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal applies <b>even to creeping animals;</b> therefore <b>the verse states “only,”</b> a term used for exclusion, indicating that creeping animals are not included. |
| Genesis 9:4 | as it is written: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat” | Sanhedrin 57a:5 | The prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal is stated in the Torah, <b>as it is written: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4), i.e., it is prohibited to eat flesh while the animal that it comes from is still alive. <b>And</b> how do <b>the other</b> <i>tanna’im</i> interpret this verse? In their opinion, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to permit</b> eating a limb from living <b>creeping animals;</b> this prohibition does not apply to creeping animals (see 59b). |
| Genesis 9:4 | “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat” | Sanhedrin 59a:6 | § The <i>baraita</i> that lists the Noahide mitzvot (56a) teaches that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says:</b> The descendants of Noah are <b>also</b> commanded concerning the prohibition against consuming <b>the blood from a living</b> animal. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: <b>“Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4), <b>this is</b> the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: The blood from a living</b> animal is <b>also</b> prohibited in this verse. |
| Genesis 9:4 | the verse states: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat” | Sanhedrin 59b:14 | <b>But when the children of Noah came,</b> God <b>permitted them</b> to eat meat; <b>as it is stated:</b> “Every moving thing that lives shall be for food for you; <b>as the green herb I have given you all”</b> (Genesis 9:3). One <b>might</b> have thought that accordingly, even the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>does not apply to</b> the descendants of Noah; therefore <b>the verse states: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4).

| Genesis 9:5 | “And surely your blood of your souls will I require” | Bava Kamma91b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> that you heard that says: It is not permitted for a person to injure himself? If we say</b> that <b>it is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And surely your blood of your souls will I require”</b> (Genesis 9:5), and <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From the hand of your souls,</b> i.e., from yourself, <b>will I require your blood,</b> meaning one is liable even for taking his own life, that is not a correct inference. |
| Genesis 9:5 | your blood of your lives I will require; | Sanhedrin 57b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> They are derived from that <b>which the verse states:</b> “And <b>your blood of your lives I will require;</b> at the hand of every animal I will require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man” (Genesis 9:5). It is derived from the term “I will require,” which is stated in the singular, that a descendant of Noah is executed <b>on the basis</b> of the verdict of <b>even one judge.</b> |
| Genesis 9:6 | it is written: “For in the image of God He made man” | Berakhot 61a:14 | <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>face, that is</b> why <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a <b>tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b> The Gemara answers: It can be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu.</b> As <b>Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,” and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), indicating that man was created alone. <b>How, then,</b> does he resolve the contradiction? <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b> |
| Genesis 9:6 | bloodshed; and so it states: “One who sheds the blood of man, | Sanhedrin 56b:6 | With regard to the term <b>“the Lord,” this</b> alludes to <b>blessing the name</b> of God; <b>and so it states</b> in another verse: <b>“And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord…shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>“God,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship; and so it states: “You shall have no other gods</b> before Me” (Exodus 20:2). <b>“The man,” this</b> alludes to <b>bloodshed; and so it states: “One who sheds the blood of man,</b> by man his blood shall be shed” (Genesis 9:6). |
| Genesis 9:6 | as it is written: “One who sheds the blood of man, | Sanhedrin 57a:3 | According to the school of Menashe, the prohibition of <b>bloodshed</b> for the descendants of Noah is stated separately in the Torah, <b>as it is written: “One who sheds the blood of man,</b> by man his blood shall be shed” (Genesis 9:6). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the other</b> <i>tanna’im</i> interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, the verse <b>reveals</b> the type of <b>death</b> penalty administered to the descendants of Noah, but it is not the source for the prohibition of bloodshed. |
| Genesis 9:6 | bloodshed, as it is written: “One who sheds the blood of man, | Sanhedrin 57a:9 | <b>Rav Sheshet objects to this</b> statement: <b>Granted,</b> a descendant of Noah is executed for <b>bloodshed, as it is written: “One who sheds the blood of man,</b> by man his blood shall be shed” (Genesis 9:6). <b>But</b> with regard to <b>those</b> other prohibitions, <b>from where do</b> the Sages derive that a descendant of Noah who transgresses them is executed? |
| Genesis 9:6 | which is written: “One who sheds the blood of a person, by a person [ ba’adam ] his blood shall be shed” | Sanhedrin 57b:5 | It is stated in that book of <i>Aggadot</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> A descendant of Noah is executed <b>even for</b> killing <b>fetuses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The Gemara answers: It is derived from that <b>which is written: “One who sheds the blood of a person, by a person [<i>ba’adam</i>] his blood shall be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6). The word <i>ba’adam</i> literally means: In a person, and is interpreted homiletically: <b>What is a person that is in a person? You must say: This is a fetus that is in its mother’s womb.</b> Accordingly, a descendant of Noah is liable for killing a fetus. |
| Genesis 9:6 | member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” | Sanhedrin 72b:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the ruling of Rav Huna, who said that a pursuer does not require a forewarning: If <b>a pursuer was pursuing another</b> person <b>in order to kill him,</b> a third party <b>says to</b> the pursuer: <b>See that he</b> whom you are pursuing to kill <b>is a Jew, and</b> a loyal <b>member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6). <b>The Torah stated: Save the blood of this</b> person who is being pursued <b>with the blood of that</b> person who is pursuing him. The fact that there is no indication here that the pursuer must say that he heard the forewarning suggests that forewarning is not required, as stated by Rav Huna. |
| Genesis 9:6 | member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” | Sanhedrin 72b:17 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that a pursuer must be forewarned, and therefore one may not save a pursued party by killing a minor who is pursuing him, from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a pursuer was pursuing another</b> person <b>in order to kill him,</b> and a third party <b>said to him: See that he</b> whom you are pursuing to kill <b>is a Jew, and</b> a loyal <b>member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6), in this case, <b>if</b> the pursuer <b>said: I know this to be so,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from being killed, but if he said: <b>I am doing it on this condition,</b> i.e., knowing that I am liable to be killed for this, he is <b>liable</b> to be slain. This indicates that even a pursuer must be issued a forewarning. |
| Genesis 9:6 | as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” | Yevamot 63b:16 | <b>Rabbi Asi said: The</b> Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. <b>As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who does not engage in</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply</b> is considered <b>as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And you, be fruitful and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7). |
| Genesis 9:6 | Image, as it is stated: “For in the image of God He made man” | Yevamot 63b:17 | <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: It is as though he diminishes the</b> Divine <b>Image, as it is stated: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And you, be fruitful</b> and multiply” (Genesis 9:7). <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> It is <b>as though he sheds blood and</b> also <b>diminishes the</b> Divine <b>Image, as it is stated: “And you, be fruitful and multiply,”</b> after the verse that alludes to both shedding blood and the Divine Image. |
| Genesis 9:7 | “And you, be fruitful, and multiply” | Avodah Zarah5a:7 | The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that if they had not sinned</b> with the Golden Calf <b>they would not have sired</b> children? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Noah and his children were instructed: <b>“And you, be fruitful, and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7)? The Gemara answers: This instruction was issued only <b>until</b> the revelation at <b>Sinai,</b> but the Jewish people would have become like angels there, had they not sinned. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>also written</b> about the Jewish people who were at the revelation <b>at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), which means that they were instructed to resume marital relations? The Gemara answers: That verse is referring <b>to the enjoyment of conjugal rights,</b> not to procreation. |
| Genesis 9:7 | swarm in the earth and multiply in it” | Sanhedrin 57a:6 | The prohibition of <b>castration</b> that applies to the descendants of Noah is stated, <b>as it is written:</b> “And you be fruitful and multiply, <b>swarm in the earth and multiply in it”</b> (Genesis 9:7), indicating that nothing may be done to prevent reproduction. <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna’im</i> hold that this verse is written <b>merely as a blessing,</b> not as a mitzva. |
| Genesis 9:7 | procreation, which was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah? As it is written: “And you, be fruitful and multiply, | Sanhedrin 59b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>procreation, which was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah? As it is written: “And you, be fruitful and multiply,</b> swarm in the land and multiply in it” (Genesis 9:7). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai,</b> in the verse: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), when the Jewish men were commanded to resume conjugal relations with their wives after having been commanded to separate from them in preparation for the giving of the Torah. Nevertheless, the mitzva of procreation <b>was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah.</b> |
| Genesis 9:7 | afterward: “And you, be fruitful and multiply” | Yevamot 63b:16 | <b>Rabbi Asi said: The</b> Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. <b>As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who does not engage in</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply</b> is considered <b>as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And you, be fruitful and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7). |
| Genesis 9:7 | afterward: “And you, be fruitful | Yevamot 63b:17 | <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: It is as though he diminishes the</b> Divine <b>Image, as it is stated: “For in the image of God He made man”</b> (Genesis 9:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And you, be fruitful</b> and multiply” (Genesis 9:7). <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> It is <b>as though he sheds blood and</b> also <b>diminishes the</b> Divine <b>Image, as it is stated: “And you, be fruitful and multiply,”</b> after the verse that alludes to both shedding blood and the Divine Image. |

| Genesis 9:15 | an oath, as it is written: “And the waters shall no more become a flood” | Shevuot 36a:13 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says: No,</b> or any negative expression, can be <b>an oath,</b> and <b>yes,</b> or any positive expression, can be <b>an oath.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Granted</b> that <b>no</b> can be <b>an oath, as it is written: “And the waters shall no more become a flood”</b> (Genesis 9:15). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to that negative commitment: <b>“As this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; as I have taken an oath</b> that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth” (Isaiah 54:9). <b>But from where do we</b> derive the fact that <b>yes</b> can be <b>an oath?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning; from</b> the fact <b>that no</b> can be <b>an oath, yes too</b> can be <b>an oath.</b> |
| Genesis 9:15 | “And the waters shall no more become a flood” | Shevuot 36a:14 | <b>Rava said: And</b> a negative expression <b>is</b> an oath only in a case <b>where one said no, no,</b> stating the term <b>two times, or</b> it is in a case <b>where one said yes, yes,</b> stating the term <b>two times, as it is written: “All flesh shall not be excised any more by floodwaters”</b> (Genesis 9:11), and it is again written: <b>“And the waters shall no more become a flood”</b> (Genesis 9:15). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that no</b> is an oath only when stated <b>two times, yes, too,</b> is an oath only when stated <b>two times.</b> |
| Genesis 9:15 | never to bring a flood to the world, | Zevachim 116a:23 | At that time, <b>all of</b> the kings <b>gathered around Balaam the wicked,</b> who was the greatest gentile prophet, <b>and said to him: What is the tumultuous sound,</b> i.e., the loud noise, <b>that we have heard? Perhaps a flood is coming to</b> destroy <b>the world, as it is stated: “The Lord sat enthroned at the flood”</b> (Psalms 29:10)? Balaam <b>said to them: “The Lord sits as King forever”</b> (Psalms 29:10), which means that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, already took an oath</b> after the flood <b>never to bring a flood to the world,</b> as it is stated: “And the waters shall no more become a flood” (Genesis 9:15). |
| Genesis 9:15 | said to them: He already took an oath that He will not destroy all flesh | Zevachim 116a:24 | The kings <b>said to him: He will not bring a flood of water,</b> as he vowed, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>He will bring a flood of fire,</b> as in the future the Lord will punish the nations with fire, <b>as it is stated: “For by fire will the Lord contend,</b> and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many” (Isaiah 66:16). Balaam <b>said to them: He already took an oath that He will not destroy all flesh</b> in any manner, as it is stated: “To destroy all flesh” (Genesis 9:15). Therefore, there will not be a flood of fire. |
| Genesis 9:20 | as it is written: “And Noah began to be a farmer [ ish ha’adama | Sanhedrin 70b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> can it be learned <b>that Solomon repented and admitted to his mother</b> that she was justified in her rebukes? <b>As it is written: “For I am more foolish than a man, and have not the understanding of a man”</b> (Proverbs 30:2). This should be understood as follows: <b>“For I am more foolish than a man [<i>ish</i>]”;</b> that is, I am more foolish than Noah, who sinned with wine and is called “a man,” <b>as it is written: “And Noah began to be a farmer [<i>ish ha’adama</i></b>]” (Genesis 9:20). <b>“And have not the understanding of a man [<i>adam</i>]”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Adam the first</b> man, who also sinned with wine, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who says that the Tree of Knowledge was a grapevine. |
| Genesis 9:21 | “And he drank from the wine and became drunk” | Berakhot 40a:14 | We learned in the mishna: One who recited: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>over fruits of the earth,</b> did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious,</b> as fruits of the earth do not fall under the rubric of trees. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This ruling in the mishna <b>is only necessary according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> in another context that <b>wheat is a type of tree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tree from which Adam, the first</b> man, <b>ate, Rabbi Meir says: It was a vine, as nothing brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon man</b> even today <b>other than wine,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And he drank from the wine and became drunk”</b> (Genesis 9:21). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: It was a fig</b> tree, <b>as with the object with which they were corrupted</b> and sinned <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). They must have taken the leaves from the tree closest at hand, the Tree of Knowledge. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It was wheat, as,</b> even today, <b>the child does not know how to call</b> his <b>father and mother until he tastes the taste of grain.</b> |
| Genesis 9:23 | “And their father’s nakedness they did not see” | Berakhot 25b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: Opposite a naked gentile, it is forbidden to recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why did</b> Rav Yehuda discuss <b>particularly</b> the case of <b>a gentile? Even with regard to a Jew</b> it is <b>also</b> prohibited. The Gemara replies: Opposite the nakedness of <b>a Jew, it is obvious</b> that it is <b>prohibited; however,</b> opposite the nakedness of <b>a gentile, it was necessary for him</b> to say. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since it is written about</b> gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20), <b>say</b> that his nakedness <b>is like</b> that of <b>a mere donkey</b> and does not constitute nakedness. Rav Yehuda <b>taught us that their</b> nakedness <b>is also considered nakedness, as it is written</b> regarding the sons of Noah: <b>“And their father’s nakedness they did not see”</b> (Genesis 9:23). Although Noah predated Abraham and was consequently not Jewish, his nakedness is mentioned. |
| Genesis 9:23 | and they did not see their father’s nakedness” | Shabbat 150a:10 | The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>it is indeed so,</b> that gentile flesh is not considered nakedness? The Gemara rejects this idea: <b>The verse</b> already <b>said</b> with regard to the sons of Noah: “And they walked backward and covered their father’s nakedness, and their faces were turned backward, <b>and they did not see their father’s nakedness”</b> (Genesis 9:23). The verse uses the term nakedness with regard to Noah, who was a gentile. |
| Genesis 9:25 | said to them: I too will cite proof to you only from the Torah, as it is stated: “And he said: Cursed will be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brethren” | Sanhedrin 91a:8 | Geviha ben Pesisa <b>said to them: From where are you citing proof</b> that the land of Canaan is yours? <b>They said to him: From the Torah.</b> Geviha ben Pesisa <b>said to them: I too will cite proof to you only from the Torah, as it is stated: “And he said: Cursed will be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brethren”</b> (Genesis 9:25). And with regard to <b>a slave who acquired property,</b> the <b>slave</b> belongs <b>to whom</b> and the <b>property</b> belongs <b>to whom?</b> The slave and his property belong to the master. <b>And moreover,</b> it is <b>several years</b> now <b>that you have not served us.</b> Therefore, not only are you not entitled to the land, there are additional debts that must be repaid, as well as a return to enslavement. |
| Genesis 9:27 | verse states: “God shall enlarge Japheth, and He shall dwell in the tents of Shem” | Megillah 9b:4 | The mishna cites that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even with regard to</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> the Sages <b>permitted them to be written only</b> in <b>Greek. Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> He based his opinion on an allusion in the Torah, as the <b>verse states: “God shall enlarge Japheth, and He shall dwell in the tents of Shem”</b> (Genesis 9:27), indicating that <b>the words of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem.</b> The language of Javan, who is the forbear of the Greek nation and one of the descendants of Japheth, will also serve as a sacred language in the tents of Shem, where Torah is studied. |
| Genesis 9:27 | said to him: That is not the reason; even had they all ascended in the days of Ezra, the Divine Presence would not have rested in the Second Temple, as it is written: “God will enlarge Japheth, and dwell in the tents of Shem” | Yoma 9b:18 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Cast a man between them,</b> and say that the incident did not involve Reish Lakish and Rabba bar bar Ḥana. It <b>was either Reish Lakish</b> bathing in the river <b>and Ze’iri,</b> the prominent Babylonian Sage, who extended him a hand, <b>or</b> it was <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> who was in the river <b>and Rabbi Elazar</b> extended a hand to him. In any event, <b>when</b> the Sage who heard what Reish Lakish said <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and related it, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: That is not the reason; even had they all ascended in the days of Ezra, the Divine Presence would not have rested in the Second Temple, as it is written: “God will enlarge Japheth, and dwell in the tents of Shem”</b> (Genesis 9:27). |
| Genesis 10:2 | As it is written: “The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tuval and Meshech and Tiras” | Yoma 10a:2 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the Persians descend from Japheth?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tuval and Meshech and Tiras”</b> (Genesis 10:2). The Gemara explains: <b>Gomer, that is Germamya; Magog, that is Kandiya; Madai, that is Macedonia; Javan, in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> Greece; <b>Tuval, that is</b> the nation called <b>Beit Unaiki; Meshech, that is Musya.</b> With regard to <b>Tiras, Rabbi Simai and the Rabbis disagree, and some say</b> the dispute is between <b>Rabbi Simon and the Rabbis: One said: That is Beit Teraiki, and one said: That is Persia.</b> According to that approach, Persia is listed among the descendants of Japheth. <b>Rav Yosef taught: Tiras is Persia.</b> |
| Genesis 10:6 | for his older son? As it is stated: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan” | Ketubot 112a:8 | <b>And even so, Hebron was more developed,</b> i.e., more fertile, <b>than Zoan</b> by <b>sevenfold, as it is written: “Now Hebron was built [<i>nivneta</i>] seven years before Zoan in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 13:22). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b><i>Nivneta</i>,</b> in this verse? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>literally</b> that Hebron <b>was built</b> before Zoan, <b>would a person build a house for his younger son before building</b> one <b>for his older son? As it is stated: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan”</b> (Genesis 10:6), which indicates that Egypt, Mizraim, was older than Canaan, in whose territory Hebron was located. |
| Genesis 10:6 | as it is written: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, | Sotah 34b:11 | The continuation of the verse states: <b>“Now Hebron was built seven years [<i>shanim</i>]</b> before Zoan of Egypt [<i>Mitzrayim</i>]” (Numbers 13:22). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“was built”? If we say</b> that <b>it was actually built</b> seven years before Zoan, <b>would a person build a house for his younger son before</b> he builds one <b>for his older son?</b> Canaan was the youngest son of Ham, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim,</b> and Put, and Canaan” (Genesis 10:6). How then could Hebron, a city in the land of Canaan, have been built before Zoan, a city in the land of Egypt, occupied by the descendants of Mizraim? |
| Genesis 10:7 | Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca” | Yoma 10a:3 | The list of nations continues: “And <b>Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca”</b> (Genesis 10:7). <b>Rav Yosef taught:</b> These are <b>the inner Sakistan and the outer Sakistan. Between one and the other</b> there was a distance of <b>one hundred parasangs, and the circumference</b> of the land was <b>one thousand parasangs.</b> |
| Genesis 10:10 | “And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, | Yoma 10a:4 | The Gemara continues interpreting the verses. It is stated: <b>“And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh,</b> in the land of Shinar” (Genesis 10:10). <b>Babel in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> Babylonia; <b>Erech, that is</b> the city known then as <b>Orikhut; and Accad, that is</b> the place known then as <b>Baskar; Calneh, that is Nofer Ninefi.</b> |
| Genesis 10:11 | “Out of that land went forth Asshur” | Yoma 10a:5 | The Torah continues: <b>“Out of that land went forth Asshur”</b> (Genesis 10:11). <b>Rav Yosef taught: Asshur, that is Silek,</b> meaning that is the region where the town Silkiya was built. <b>“And built Nineveh and Rehoboth-ir and Calah”</b> (Genesis 10:11). <b>Nineveh, in accordance with its plain meaning; Rehovoth-ir, that is</b> the town later known as <b>Perat of Meishan; Calah, that is Perat of Bursif. “And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, it is the great city”</b> (Genesis 10:12). <b>Resen, that is</b> the town later known as <b>Akteisfon. It is the great city; I do not know whether</b> this means that <b>Nineveh</b> is <b>the great city,</b> or <b>whether</b> it means that <b>Resen</b> is <b>the great city. When it says: “And Nineveh was a great city of God, a three-day journey across”</b> (Jonah 3:3), <b>you must say</b> that <b>Nineveh is the great city.</b> |
| Genesis 10:12 | Perat of Meishan; Calah, that is Perat of Bursif. “And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, it is the great city” | Yoma 10a:5 | The Torah continues: <b>“Out of that land went forth Asshur”</b> (Genesis 10:11). <b>Rav Yosef taught: Asshur, that is Silek,</b> meaning that is the region where the town Silkiya was built. <b>“And built Nineveh and Rehoboth-ir and Calah”</b> (Genesis 10:11). <b>Nineveh, in accordance with its plain meaning; Rehovoth-ir, that is</b> the town later known as <b>Perat of Meishan; Calah, that is Perat of Bursif. “And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, it is the great city”</b> (Genesis 10:12). <b>Resen, that is</b> the town later known as <b>Akteisfon.

| Genesis 10:21 | from there, and we learn it from here: “And to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, to him also were children born” | Sanhedrin 69b:17 | <b>Rav Kahana says: I stated this discussion before Rav Zevid of Neharde’a.</b> When he heard it, <b>he said to me: You learn</b> that Shem was not Noah’s oldest son <b>from there, and we learn it from here: “And to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, to him also were children born”</b> (Genesis 10:21). This verse indicates that <b>Japheth,</b> rather than Shem, <b>was the oldest of the brothers.</b> |

The Gemara cites further examples: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1), about whom it is stated: <b>“These made war”</b> (Genesis 14:2). Another verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho”</b> (Joshua 5:13), it was there that he saw an angel <b>“with his sword drawn in his hand”</b> as a warning. It is written: <b>“And the Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua”</b> (Joshua 6:27), and immediately afterward: <b>“But the children of Israel committed a trespass”</b> (Joshua 7:1). It states: <b>“And it came to pass that there was a certain man of Ramathaim”</b> (I Samuel 1:1), and it mentions shortly afterward Hannah’s inability to conceive: <b>“For he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed up her womb”</b> (I Samuel 1:5). |
| Genesis 11:4 | “Come, let us build us a city, | Avodah Zarah19a:1 | is referring to <b>our forefather Abraham, who did not walk in the counsel of the members of the generation of the dispersion, who were wicked, as it is stated</b> that they said to each other: <b>“Come, let us build us a city,</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven” (Genesis 11:4), a project with a wicked aim. <b>“Nor stood in the way of sinners”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this too is referring to Abraham, <b>who did not join in the stand of</b> the residents of <b>Sodom, who were sinners, as it is stated: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly”</b> (Genesis 13:13). |
| Genesis 11:4 | he said: “Come, let us build a city | Chullin 89a:7 | <b>But the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are not so.

I granted greatness <b>to Sennacherib,</b> yet he said: <b>“Who are they among all the gods of the countries</b> that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand” (II Kings 18:35). I granted greatness <b>to Nebuchadnezzar,</b> yet <b>he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</b> (Isaiah 14:14). I granted greatness <b>to Ḥiram, king of Tyre,</b> yet <b>he said: “I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the seas”</b> (Ezekiel 28:2). |

| Genesis 11:4 | for the sake of idol worship.

| Genesis 11:27 | “And these are the generations of Terah; Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran” | Sanhedrin 69b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>from here</b> that one can deduce that in earlier generations men fathered children at the age of eight, as it is written: <b>“And these are the generations of Terah; Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran”</b> (Genesis 11:27). <b>And Abraham was</b> at least <b>one year older than Nahor, and Nahor was one year older than Haran,</b> so <b>it turns out</b> that <b>Abraham was two years older than Haran.

| Genesis 12:1 | as it is written: “And the Lord said to Abram: Go you out of your county” | Rosh Hashanah16b:7 | <b>And some say: Also, a change of</b> one’s <b>place</b> of residence cancels an evil judgment, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord said to Abram: Go you out of your county”</b> (Genesis 12:1), <b>and afterward</b> it is written: <b>“And I will make of you a great nation”</b> (Genesis 12: 2). The Gemara explains: <b>And the other</b> one, i.e., Rabbi Yitzḥak, who does not include a change of residence in his list, holds that in the case of Abram, <b>it was the merit</b> and sanctity <b>of Eretz Yisrael that helped him</b> become the father of a great nation. |
| Genesis 12:2 | Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said | Pesachim 117b:11 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> with regard to God’s blessing of Avraham: “And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2). <b>“And I will make of you a great nation”; this is</b> fulfilled in the opening of the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i>, <b>as</b> Jews <b>say: God of Abraham. “And I will bless you”; this is</b> fulfilled when <b>they say: God of Isaac,</b> as it is a blessing for a father when the name of his son is eternalized. <b>“And I will make your name great”; this is</b> fulfilled <b>when they say: God of Jacob.</b> |
| Genesis 12:3 | A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you” | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,</b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority,</b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Genesis 12:3 | “And I will bless them that bless you” | Chullin 49a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>from where does Rabbi Akiva</b> learn about <b>a blessing for the priests? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> He learns it <b>from</b> God’s promise to Abraham: <b>“And I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3). All who bless the Jewish people are blessed themselves. |
| Genesis 12:3 | is not blessed, as it is stated: “And I will bless those who bless you” | Sotah 38b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the Priestly Benediction? As it is stated: “So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27). This shows that God waits for the priests to bless the people, and only then He Himself blesses them. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who blesses</b> the people <b>is blessed</b> from Heaven, <b>and one who does not bless</b> the people <b>is not blessed, as it is stated: “And I will bless those who bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3). |
| Genesis 12:3 | is written: “And in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed [ nivrekhu ]” | Yevamot 63a:6 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “And in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed [<i>nivrekhu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 12:3)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham: I have two good shoots to graft</b> [<b><i>lehavrikh</i></b>] <b>onto you: Ruth the Moabite,</b> the ancestress of the house of David, <b>and Naamah the Ammonite,</b> whose marriage with Solomon led to the ensuing dynasty of the kings of Judea. <b>“All the families of the earth”</b> means: <b>Even families that live in the earth,</b> i.e., who have land of their own, <b>are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b> Similarly, when the verse states: <b>“All the nations of the earth</b> shall be blessed in him” (Genesis 18:18), it indicates that <b>even ships that come from Galia to Hispania are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b> |
| Genesis 12:5 | “And the souls that they had gotten in Haran” | Avodah Zarah9a:7 | <b>Rather,</b> the two-thousand-year time period of the Torah is counted <b>from</b> the time when it is stated about Abraham and Sarah: <b>“And the souls that they had gotten in Haran”</b> (Genesis 12:5), which is interpreted by the Sages as referring to the men and women who were brought closer to the Torah by Abraham and Sarah. Therefore, it was at this point that the Torah began to spread throughout the world. <b>And it is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that at that time Abraham was fifty-two</b> years old. |
| Genesis 12:5 | and the souls that they formed in Haran” | Sanhedrin 99b:12 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who teaches Torah to the son of another, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he formed</b> that student, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Abram took Sarai his wife…<b>and the souls that they formed in Haran”</b> (Genesis 12:5). They are given credit for forming the students to whom they taught Torah. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It is <b>as though he fashioned [<i>asa’an</i>] the words of Torah</b> themselves, <b>as it is stated: “Observe the words of this covenant, <i>va’asitem otam</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:8), indicating that studying the Torah is like fashioning it. <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>as though he fashioned himself, as it is stated: “<i>Va’asitem otam</i>.” Do not read</b> “<i>va’asitem <b>otam</b></i><b>”</b> as: And you shall fashion them; <b>rather,</b> read it as <i>va’asitem <b>atem</b></i><b>,</b> meaning: You shall fashion yourself. |
| Genesis 12:6 | and there it states: “And Abram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until the oaks of Moreh” | Sotah 32a:10 | <b>How</b> did the ceremony of the <b>blessings and curses</b> take place? <b>When the Jewish people crossed the Jordan River they came to Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, which are in Samaria alongside</b> the city of <b>Shechem, which is near the oaks of Moreh, as it is stated: “Are they not beyond the Jordan,</b> behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?” (Deuteronomy 11:30), <b>and there it states: “And Abram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until the oaks of Moreh”</b> (Genesis 12:6). <b>Just as the oaks of Moreh mentioned there</b> with regard to Abraham <b>are</b> close to <b>Shechem, so too, the oaks of Moreh mentioned here are</b> close to <b>Shechem.</b> |
| Genesis 12:6 | states: “And Abram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until the oaks of Moreh” | Sotah 33b:5 | <b>“In the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah”; this</b> is referring to <b>Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where the Samaritans</b> now <b>live. “Over against Gilgal”;</b> this means <b>near Gilgal. “Beside the oaks of Moreh”;</b> this is referring to <b>Shechem. And</b> from where is it derived that this is Shechem? <b>There,</b> with regard to Abraham, the verse <b>states: “And Abram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until the oaks of Moreh”</b> (Genesis 12:6). <b>Just as the oaks of Moreh stated there are</b> identified as <b>Shechem, so too here,</b> they are <b>Shechem.</b> |
| Genesis 12:10 | “And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there” | Bava Kamma60b:6 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>famine in the city, spread your feet,</b> i.e., leave the city, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there”</b> (Genesis 12:10). <b>And it says: “If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there;</b> and if we sit here, we die also, now come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die” (II Kings 7:4). |
| Genesis 12:10 | “ Mitzraima ” | Yevamot 13b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that with regard to <b>any word that requires</b> the letter <b><i>lamed</i> at its beginning,</b> meaning: To, <b>the verse</b> at times <b>placed</b> a letter <b><i>heh</i> at its end,</b> but the meaning is the same. <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For example,</b> the term: To <b>“Elim”</b> (Exodus 16:1) can be rendered as <b>“<i>Elima</i>”</b> (Exodus 15:27) instead of <i>le’Elim</i>; <b>“Maḥanaim”</b> (I Kings 2:8) becomes <b>“<i>Maḥanaima</i>”</b> (II Samuel 17:24); <b>“<i>Mitzraim</i>”</b> (e.g., Genesis 13:1) into <b>“<i>Mitzraima</i>”</b> (Genesis 12:10); Divlatayim is <b>“<i>Divlataima</i>”</b> (Numbers 33:46); to <i>Yerushalaim</i> is <b>“<i>Yerushalaima</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 8:3); and <b>“<i>midbara</i>”</b> (Joshua 18:12) means: To the wilderness [<i>midbar</i>]. All these words that contain the letter <i>heh</i> at the end mean the same as if there were a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning. |
| Genesis 12:11 | as it is written: “Now I know that you are a beautiful woman” | Bava Batra16a:15 | Job further said: <b>“O that my vexation were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances”</b> (Job 6:2). <b>Rav says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth of Job,</b> meaning, he should not have spoken in such a manner, as if he were weighing his deeds against those of God; may one act as if he is in <b>a friendship with Heaven?</b> And similarly, Job said: <b>“There is no arbiter between us, who may lay his hand upon us both”</b> (Job 9:33). <b>Rav says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth of Job</b> for saying this; <b>is there a servant who rebukes his master?</b> Job also said: <b>“I have made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon a virgin?”</b> (Job 31:1). <b>Rava says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth</b> of <b>Job</b> for saying this; <b>he</b> did not look <b>at other</b> women, but <b>Abraham did not even look at his own</b> wife, <b>as it is written: “Now I know that you are a beautiful woman”</b> (Genesis 12:11). One may learn <b>by inference that initially he did not know</b> how beautiful she was because he had not gazed at her. |
| Genesis 12:14 | “very | Sanhedrin 39b:21 | The chapter closes with the explication of a verse stated with regard to Abishag, who attended King David before his death: <b>“And the damsel was very fair [<i>yafa ad me’od</i> ]”</b> (I Kings 1:4). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: She still did not reach half the beauty of Sarah, as it is written:</b> “<i>Ad me’od</i>,” which can be translated as <b>“up to very</b> fair,” <b>but not including</b> the praise of <b>“very</b> fair.” By contrast, it is written concerning Sarah: “She was very fair” (Genesis 12:14). |
| Genesis 12:16 | “And he dealt well with Abram for her sake, | Bava Metzia59a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo says: A person must always be careful about</b> sustaining <b>the honor of his wife, as blessing is found in a person’s house only because of his wife, as it is stated</b> in allusion to this: <b>“And he dealt well with Abram for her sake,</b> and he had sheep and oxen” (Genesis 12:16). <b>And that is what Rava said to the residents of Meḥoza,</b> where he lived: <b>Honor your wives, so that you will become rich.</b> |
| Genesis 12:17 | afflictions | Arakhin 16a:9 | <b>And for forbidden sexual relations, as it is written: “And the Lord afflicted Pharaoh</b> and his house with great <b>afflictions</b> because of Sarai, Abram’s wife” (Genesis 12:17). |
| Genesis 12:20 | says: Due to four steps that Pharaoh accompanied Abraham, as it is stated: “And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him, | Sotah 46b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One who walks along the way without</b> having someone to <b>accompany</b> him <b>should occupy himself with</b> words of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to words of Torah: <b>“For they shall be a chaplet of grace to your head, and chains around your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9). <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>says: Due to four steps that Pharaoh accompanied Abraham, as it is stated: “And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him,</b> and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had” (Genesis 12:20), Pharaoh <b>enslaved</b> Abraham’s <b>descendants</b> for <b>four hundred years, as it is stated: “And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years”</b> (Genesis 15:13). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who accompanies his friend four cubits in a city will come to no harm</b> by accompanying him. The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina accompanied Rava bar Yitzḥak four cubits in a city. He came close to harm, but he was saved.</b> |
| Genesis 13:3 | to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, | Arakhin 16b:17 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where in the Torah</b> is it derived <b>that a person should not change his</b> place of <b>lodging? As it is stated</b> when Abraham returned from Egypt: “And he went on his journeys from the South to Beth El, <b>to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,</b> between Beth El and Ai” (Genesis 13:3). Abraham took pains to revisit the same places he had stayed on his journey to Egypt. |
| Genesis 13:5 | as it is written: “And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents” | Bava Kamma93a:2 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Drag wood after a property owner.</b> In other words, help out a wealthy man even in a small way, as this may lead to your benefiting from him. Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents”</b> (Genesis 13:5). |
| Genesis 13:8 | “For we are brothers” | Yevamot 17b:6 | The Gemara objects on another count: <b>Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>brotherhood</b> from the term <b>brotherhood from Lot, as it is written</b> that Abraham said to Lot: <b>“For we are brothers”</b> (Genesis 13:8). From here one could conclude that the word brothers means relatives and not necessarily brothers. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is</b> more <b>reasonable to derive from the children of Jacob, due to</b> the fact that the word “brothers” <b>is free</b> in its context and is therefore available to be used in a verbal analogy: <b>Since it could have written: We your servants are twelve children of our father,</b> but instead it <b>writes:</b> “Twelve <b>brothers,</b> the children of one man” (Genesis 42:13), <b>learn from here</b> that this comes <b>to render</b> the word “brothers” <b>free</b> so that it may be allocated to another matter, i.e., the definition of brothers. |
| Genesis 13:10 | this entire verse: | Horayot 10b:10 | The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps</b> Lot <b>too intended</b> his action <b>for the sake of a mitzva.

| Genesis 13:10 | than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt” | Ketubot 112a:7 | <b>And you have no more outstanding</b> earth <b>among all the lands</b> other <b>than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 13:10). <b>And you have no more outstanding</b> region <b>in all of the land of Egypt than Zoan.</b> The superior quality of Zoan is derived from the fact <b>that they would raise kings there, as it is written: “For his princes are at Zoan”</b> (Isaiah 30:4). <b>And you have no rockier</b> terrain <b>in all of Eretz Yisrael than Hebron, as</b> people <b>would bury</b> their <b>dead there,</b> e.g., the Patriarchs in the Cave of Machpelah, because the land was not arable. |
| Genesis 13:10 | This entire verse: | Nazir 23a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps</b> Lot <b>too intended</b> that his actions should be <b>for the sake of a mitzva?</b> The Gemara answers: This was not the case, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to Lot: <b>This entire verse:</b> “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere” (Genesis 13:10), <b>is stated with regard to</b> the <b>sin</b> of licentiousness. Since this verse teaches that Lot was a lustful man, it can therefore be assumed he meant to sin with his daughters as well. |
| Genesis 13:10 | And of all the lands, there is none of a higher quality than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt” | Sotah 34b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the meaning of the verse is <b>that</b> Hebron <b>was seven times more fruitful [<i>mevunna</i>] than Zoan. And there is no stonier land in Eretz Yisrael than Hebron.</b> This is evident <b>because they would bury the dead there,</b> just as the forefathers were buried there. This was done only in land that was not suitable for agriculture. <b>And of all the lands, there is none of a higher quality than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 13:10). <b>And there was no higher-quality</b> land <b>in all of the land of Egypt than Zoan, as it is written</b> with regard to Pharaoh’s ministers, who would certainly have lived on the finest land in the country: <b>“For his princes are in Zoan”</b> (Isaiah 30:4). <b>And even so, Hebron was seven times more fruitful than Zoan.</b> |
| Genesis 13:12 | “And he moved his tent as far as Sodom” | Yoma 38b:8 | Then he asked: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages said: But the name of the wicked shall rot,</b> derived? <b>He said to him: As it is written</b> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <b>“But the name of the wicked shall rot.”</b> He then asked him: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive this?

| Genesis 13:13 | Sodom, who were sinners, as it is stated: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly” | Avodah Zarah19a:1 | is referring to <b>our forefather Abraham, who did not walk in the counsel of the members of the generation of the dispersion, who were wicked, as it is stated</b> that they said to each other: <b>“Come, let us build us a city,</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven” (Genesis 11:4), a project with a wicked aim. <b>“Nor stood in the way of sinners”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this too is referring to Abraham, <b>who did not join in the stand of</b> the residents of <b>Sodom, who were sinners, as it is stated: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly”</b> (Genesis 13:13). |
| Genesis 13:13 | for the World-to-Come.

His walking was to demonstrate the divine promise and thereby emphasize his descendants’ claim to the land, but it did not effect acquisition of it. |
| Genesis 13:17 | Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro throughout the entire world and I have not found anyone as faithful as Your servant Abraham, to whom You said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you” | Bava Batra15b:12 | § Having mentioned the book of Job, the Gemara addresses several matters relating to it. It is stated: <b>“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them. And the Lord said to the Satan: From where do you come? And the Satan answered</b> the Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking through it” (Job 1:6–7). The Satan <b>said to</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro throughout the entire world and I have not found anyone as faithful as Your servant Abraham, to whom You said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17). <b>And even so, when he did not find a place to bury Sarah before he purchased</b> a burial site <b>for four hundred silver shekels, he did not find fault with Your ways</b> or complain about the fact that you had failed to fulfill Your promise. |
| Genesis 13:17 | Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro across the entire world and have not found anyone as faithful as your servant Abraham, to whom you said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you” | Bava Batra16a:3 | <b>“Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves</b> before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them to present himself before God. <b>And the Lord said to the Satan: From where do you come? And the Satan answered the Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the earth</b> and from walking up and down in it” (Job 2:1–2). The Satan <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro across the entire world and have not found anyone as faithful as your servant Abraham, to whom you said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17). <b>And when he wanted to bury Sarah, he could not find a place to bury her, and</b> yet <b>he did not criticize Your ways,</b> or accuse You of having failed to keep Your promise. |
| Genesis 13:17 | found; as several times I revealed Myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty [ El Shaddai ] and they did not question My attributes, and did not say to Me: What is Your name? I said to Abraham: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto you I will give it” | Sanhedrin 111a:8 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses: <b>Woe over those who are gone and are no</b> longer <b>found; as several times I revealed Myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty [<i>El Shaddai</i>] and they did not question My attributes, and did not say to Me: What is Your name? I said to Abraham: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto you I will give it”</b> (Genesis 13:17). Ultimately, <b>he sought a place to bury Sarah and did not find</b> one <b>until he purchased</b> it <b>for four hundred silver shekels, and he did not question My attributes</b> and did not protest that I failed to fulfill My promise to give him the land. |
| Genesis 13:17 | Not that of Abraham, about whom it is written, “Rise, walk through the land through its length | Shabbat 118b:1 | <b>on the inheritance of Jacob your father,</b> as the mouth of God has spoken” (Isaiah 58:13–14). The reward for delighting in Shabbat is specifically the portion of Jacob. <b>Not that of Abraham, about whom it is written, “Rise, walk through the land through its length</b> and its width because I have given it to you” (Genesis 13:17), i.e., only this land alone in its borders. <b>And not that of Isaac, about whom it is written,</b> “Dwell in this land and I will be with you and I will bless you <b>because I will give all of these lands to you and your offspring”</b> (Genesis 26:3), meaning these lands and no others. <b>Rather, that of Jacob, about whom it is written,</b> “And your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, <b>and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south,</b> and all of the families of the land will be blessed through you and your offspring” (Genesis 28:14). There are no boundaries for Jacob’s portion. |
| Genesis 14:1 | “And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel” | Eruvin 53a:7 | They disagreed about this verse as well: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both identified Amraphel with Nimrod. However, <b>one said: Nimrod was his name. And why was his name called Amraphel?</b> It is a contraction of two Hebrew words: <b>As he said [<i>amar</i>]</b> the command <b>and cast [<i>hippil</i>] our father Abraham into the fiery furnace,</b> when Abraham rebelled against and challenged his proclaimed divinity. <b>And one said: Amraphel was his name. And why was his name called Nimrod? Because he caused the entire world to rebel [<i>himrid</i>]</b> against <b>God during his reign.</b> |
| Genesis 14:1 | “And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel” | Megillah 10b:6 | <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] as they journeyed from the east”</b> (Genesis 11:2) is followed by: <b>“Come, let us build us a city”</b> (Genesis 11:4), which led to the sin of the Tower of Babel. The Gemara cites further examples: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1), about whom it is stated: <b>“These made war”</b> (Genesis 14:2). Another verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho”</b> (Joshua 5:13), it was there that he saw an angel <b>“with his sword drawn in his hand”</b> as a warning. It is written: <b>“And the Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua”</b> (Joshua 6:27), and immediately afterward: <b>“But the children of Israel committed a trespass”</b> (Joshua 7:1). It states: <b>“And it came to pass that there was a certain man of Ramathaim”</b> (I Samuel 1:1), and it mentions shortly afterward Hannah’s inability to conceive: <b>“For he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed up her womb”</b> (I Samuel 1:5). |
| Genesis 14:2 | “These made war” | Megillah 10b:6 | <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] as they journeyed from the east”</b> (Genesis 11:2) is followed by: <b>“Come, let us build us a city”</b> (Genesis 11:4), which led to the sin of the Tower of Babel. The Gemara cites further examples: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1), about whom it is stated: <b>“These made war”</b> (Genesis 14:2). Another verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho”</b> (Joshua 5:13), it was there that he saw an angel <b>“with his sword drawn in his hand”</b> as a warning. It is written: <b>“And the Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua”</b> (Joshua 6:27), and immediately afterward: <b>“But the children of Israel committed a trespass”</b> (Joshua 7:1).

| Genesis 14:4 | “Chedorlaomer” | Chullin 65a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> what about the name: <b>“Chedorlaomer”</b> (Genesis 14:4), <b>which the scribe splits in two</b> so that it appears as: Chedor Laomer? Is it <b>also</b> true there <b>that they are two names?</b> The verse is clearly referring to only one person. <b>They say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> with regard to Chedor Laomer, the scribe <b>splits</b> the name <b>into two words,</b> but he <b>may not split it into two lines</b> if the first half nears the end of one line. <b>But here, he may split</b> the name <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>even into two lines,</b> indicating that they are completely separate. |
| Genesis 14:14 | 210 years? Because he made a draft [ angarya ] of Torah scholars, as it is stated: “He led forth his trained men, born in his house” | Nedarim 32a:14 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: For what reason was Abraham our Patriarch punished and his children enslaved to Egypt</b> for <b>210 years? Because he made a draft [<i>angarya</i>] of Torah scholars, as it is stated: “He led forth his trained men, born in his house”</b> (Genesis 14:14). These trained men that he took to war were actually his disciples, who were Torah scholars. |
| Genesis 14:14 | “He led forth [ vayyarek ] his trained men, born in his house” | Nedarim 32a:16 | The Gemara returns to discuss one of the verses cited previously: <b>“He led forth [<i>vayyarek</i>] his trained men, born in his house”</b> (Genesis 14:14). <b>Rav said: He showered them [<i>horikan</i>] with Torah</b> like someone who pours from one vessel into another, <b>and Shmuel said: He showered them [<i>horikan</i>] with gold</b> and gave them an abundance of money so that they would go to war with him. |
| Genesis 14:14 | “eighteen and three hundred” | Nedarim 32a:17 | The Torah states that he took <b>“eighteen and three hundred”</b> (Genesis 14:14) men to war. <b>Rabbi Ami bar Abba said: Eliezer</b> was <b>equivalent</b> to <b>all of them. There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> Only <b>Eliezer is</b> referred to here, <b>as the numerical value</b> of the letters of his name <b>is this</b> amount, i.e., 318. |
| Genesis 14:14 | “And he pursued as far as Dan” | Sanhedrin 96a:5 | With regard to the previous verse: <b>“And he pursued as far as Dan”</b> (Genesis 14:14), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Once that righteous</b> person, Abraham, <b>came to Dan, his strength weakened. He saw</b> through the Divine Spirit <b>that his descendants were destined to worship idols in Dan, as it is stated:</b> “And he fashioned two calves of gold…<b>and he set one in Bethel, and the other one he placed in Dan”</b> (I Kings 12:28–29). <b>And even that wicked</b> person, Nebuchadnezzar, <b>did not prevail until he reached Dan, as it is stated: “From Dan the snorting of his horses is heard”</b> (Jeremiah 8:16). |
| Genesis 14:18 | and he was priest of God the Most High” | Nedarim 32b:6 | <b>Rabbi Zekharya said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted the priesthood to emerge from Shem,</b> so that his children would be priests, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; <b>and he was priest of God the Most High”</b> (Genesis 14:18). <b>Once</b> Melchizedek, traditionally identified as Shem, <b>placed the blessing of Abraham before the blessing of the Omnipresent,</b> He had the priesthood <b>emerge from Abraham</b> in particular, and not from any other descendant of Shem. |
| Genesis 14:18 | And this is as it is written: “And he was priest of God the Most High” | Nedarim 32b:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>And this is as it is written: “And he was priest of God the Most High”</b> (Genesis 14:18), which emphasizes that <b>he,</b> Melchizedek, <b>is a priest, but his children</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>priests.</b> |
| Genesis 14:19 | Creator [ koneh ] of heaven and earth” | Pesachim 87b:6 | The Gemara proceeds to enumerate all four: <b>Torah is one acquisition, as it is written: “The Lord acquired me as the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). <b>Heaven and earth are one acquisition [<i>kinyan</i>], as it is written:</b> “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, <b>Creator [<i>koneh</i>] of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:19). <b>The Holy Temple is one acquisition, as it is written:</b> “And He brought them to His sacred border, <b>to this mountain, which His right hand had acquired”</b> (Psalms 78:54). <b>The Jewish people are one acquisition, as it is written: “The nation that You have acquired”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>And you,</b> Hosea, <b>said</b> that I should <b>replace them with another nation?</b> |
| Genesis 14:21 | “Give me the people and take the goods to yourself” | Nedarim 32a:15 | <b>And Shmuel said: Because he greatly examined [<i>hifriz</i>] the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”</b> (Genesis 15:8). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He was punished <b>because he distanced people from entering under the wings of the Divine Presence, as it is stated</b> that the king of Sodom said to him: <b>“Give me the people and take the goods to yourself”</b> (Genesis 14:21), but Abraham refused to take any goods either. If he had not listened to the king of Sodom and had allowed the people to remain with him, he would have brought the prisoners under the wings of the Divine Presence. |
| Genesis 14:22 | that it is written with regard to him: “I have lifted up my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth” | Sotah 4b:14 | Having interpreted the phrase: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 16:5), the Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Hand to hand, he shall not be unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)? <b>Rav says: Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress, even</b> if <b>he</b> were to have <b>attributed possession of heaven and earth to the Holy One, Blessed be He, just as Abraham our forefather</b> did, <b>that it is written with regard to him: “I have lifted up my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:22), <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b> Abraham is described as one whose hands were lifted to declare the glory of God, yet this verse declares that even if one who engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse were to use his hands in the same way, still, due to his sin, the verse says: “He shall not be unpunished.” |
| Genesis 14:23 | a thread nor a shoe strap | Chullin 89a:1 | <b>“That</b> I will not take <b>a thread nor a shoe strap</b> nor anything that is yours” (Genesis 14:23), distancing himself from anything not rightfully his, <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The thread of sky-blue wool</b> worn on ritual fringes <b>and the strap of phylacteries.</b> |
| Genesis 14:23 | a thread nor a shoe strap | Sotah 17a:21 | <b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said</b> to the king of Sodom: <b>“That</b> I will not take <b>a thread nor a shoe strap</b> nor anything that is yours” (Genesis 14:23), distancing himself from anything not rightfully his, <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The thread of sky-blue</b> wool worn on ritual fringes <b>and the strap of phylacteries.</b> |
| Genesis 15:2 | “He is Damascus [ Dammesek ] Eliezer” | Yoma 28b:8 | <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham, was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all he had”</b> (Genesis 24:2). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The verse means that <b>he had mastery over the Torah of his master,</b> having gained proficiency in all of the Torah of Abraham. That is the meaning of the verse: <b>“He is Damascus [<i>Dammesek</i>] Eliezer”</b> (Genesis 15:2). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The word <i>Dammesek</i> is a contraction of he <b>who draws [<i>doleh</i>] and gives drink [<i>mashke</i>] to others from his master’s Torah.</b> |
| Genesis 15:3 | one born in my house is to be my heir” | Shabbat 156a:13 | <b>And Rav also holds</b> that <b>there is no constellation for the Jewish people, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“And He brought him outside,</b> and said: Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if you are able to count them; and He said unto him: So shall your offspring be” (Genesis 15:5). The Sages derived from this that <b>Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> “Behold, You have given me no offspring, and <b>one born in my house is to be my heir”</b> (Genesis 15:3). The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to him: No.</b> “And, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: This man shall not be your heir; <b>rather, one that will come forth from your own innards shall be your heir”</b> (Genesis 15:4). |
| Genesis 15:4 | rather, one that will come forth from your own innards shall be your heir” | Shabbat 156a:13 | <b>And Rav also holds</b> that <b>there is no constellation for the Jewish people, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that there is no constellation for the Jewish people?

| Genesis 15:5 | “and He brought him outside” | Nedarim 32a:9 | The Gemara expounds the verse <b>“and He brought him outside”</b> (Genesis 15:5): Abraham <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, I looked at my constellation and</b> according to it <b>I</b> will <b>have only one son,</b> and a son has already been born to me, i.e., Ishmael. <b>He said to him: Emerge from your astrology</b> because <b>there is no constellation for the Jewish people,</b> as they are not subject to the influence of astrology. |
| Genesis 15:5 | “And He brought him outside, | Shabbat 156a:13 | <b>And Rav also holds</b> that <b>there is no constellation for the Jewish people, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“And He brought him outside,</b> and said: Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if you are able to count them; and He said unto him: So shall your offspring be” (Genesis 15:5). The Sages derived from this that <b>Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> “Behold, You have given me no offspring, and <b>one born in my house is to be my heir”</b> (Genesis 15:3). The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to him: No.</b> “And, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: This man shall not be your heir; <b>rather, one that will come forth from your own innards shall be your heir”</b> (Genesis 15:4). |
| Genesis 15:6 | “And he believed in God, | Shabbat 97a:5 | <b>They are believers, as it is written: “And the people believed</b> once they heard that God had remembered the children of Israel, and that He saw their affliction, and they bowed and they prostrated” (Exodus 4:31). <b>The children of believers,</b> as it says with regard to Abraham our Patriarch: <b>“And he believed in God,</b> and He counted it for him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). <b>Ultimately, you will not believe, as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Moses and to Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b> to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel” (Numbers 20:12). <b>From where</b> do we know that Moses <b>was afflicted</b> in his body? <b>As it is written: “And God said to him further: Bring your hand to your bosom,</b> and he brought his hand to his bosom and he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow” (Exodus 4:6). |
| Genesis 15:8 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world there was no person who called him “Lord” until Abraham came and called him Lord. As it is stated: “And he said, ‘My Lord, God, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?’” | Berakhot 7b:1 | Until now, the Gemara has cited statements made by Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of the <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yosei. Now, the Gemara begins to cite what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world there was no person who called him “Lord” until Abraham came and called him Lord. As it is stated: “And he said, ‘My Lord, God, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?’”</b> (Genesis 15:8). |
| Genesis 15:8 | it is written: “And he said, O Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?” | Megillah 31b:4 | <b>And</b> with regard to Abraham <b>it is written: “And he said, O Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?”</b> (Genesis 15:8). <b>Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, perhaps, Heaven forbid, the Jewish people will sin before You, and You will do to them as</b> You did to the <b>generation of the Flood and as</b> You did to the <b>generation of the Dispersion,</b> i.e., You will completely destroy them? God <b>said to him: No,</b> I will not do that. |
| Genesis 15:8 | And Shmuel said: Because he greatly examined [ hifriz ] the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” | Nedarim 32a:15 | <b>And Shmuel said: Because he greatly examined [<i>hifriz</i>] the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”</b> (Genesis 15:8). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He was punished <b>because he distanced people from entering under the wings of the Divine Presence, as it is stated</b> that the king of Sodom said to him: <b>“Give me the people and take the goods to yourself”</b> (Genesis 14:21), but Abraham refused to take any goods either. If he had not listened to the king of Sodom and had allowed the people to remain with him, he would have brought the prisoners under the wings of the Divine Presence. |
| Genesis 15:8 | heaven and earth would not continue to exist, as it is stated: “And he said: Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?” | Taanit 27b:3 | § The mishna taught: <b>And the Israelites of that priestly watch assembled in their towns and read the act of Creation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that they must read this specific portion, derived? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: Were it not for</b> the <b>non-priestly watches</b> and the Temple service, <b>heaven and earth would not continue to exist, as it is stated: “And he said: Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?”</b> (Genesis 15:8). |
| Genesis 15:9 | said to him: “Take Me a heifer of three years old” | Megillah 31b:5 | Abraham then <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe: “By what shall I know this?”</b> God <b>said to him: “Take Me a heifer of three years old”</b> (Genesis 15:9). With this, God intimated to Abraham that even if his descendants will sin, they will be able to achieve atonement through sacrificing offerings. Abraham <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> this <b>works out well when the Temple is standing</b> and offerings can be brought to achieve atonement, but <b>when the Temple will no</b> longer <b>be standing, what will become of them?</b> God <b>said to him: I have already established for them the order of offerings,</b> i.e., the verses of the Torah pertaining to the <i>halakhot</i> of the offerings. <b>Whenever they read those</b> portions, <b>I will deem it as if they sacrificed an offering before Me, and I will pardon them for all of their iniquities.</b> |
| Genesis 15:9 | “Take for Me a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old goat, | Taanit 27b:4 | The Gemara explains this verse. <b>Abraham said: Master of the Universe, perhaps the Jews</b> will <b>sin before You.</b> Will <b>You treat them as</b> You did <b>the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion,</b> and destroy them? God <b>said to him: No.</b> Abraham <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, tell me, with what shall I inherit it?</b> How can my descendants ensure that You will maintain the world? God <b>said to</b> Abraham: <b>“Take for Me a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old goat,</b> and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon” (Genesis 15:9). God was alluding to the offerings, in whose merit the Jewish people, and through them the entire world, will be spared divine punishment. |
| Genesis 15:13 | “And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years” | Sanhedrin 99a:6 | <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>four hundred years. It is written here</b> with regard to the Covenant of the Pieces: <b>“And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years”</b> (Genesis 15:13); <b>and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us.”</b> |
| Genesis 15:13 | to Abraham, to whom You said: “Know certainly | Shabbat 89b:3 | <b>And</b> the Jewish people <b>will say before Him: Master of the Universe, to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go <b>to Abraham, to whom You said: “Know certainly</b> that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf?</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Isaac, who blessed Esau</b> and said: <b>“And it shall come to pass when you shall break loose,</b> that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck” (Genesis 27:40), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Jacob, to whom You said: “I will go down to Egypt with you”</b> (Genesis 46:4), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> And if so, <b>to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go to our Patriarchs, who do not have mercy on us? Rather, <b>now God</b> Himself <b>says</b> what punishment we deserve. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Since you made yourselves dependent on Me, “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow.”</b> |
| Genesis 15:13 | Know that your seed shall be a stranger | Sotah 11a:1 | This is <b>as it is written</b> there: “Thus said the Lord: <b>Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house”</b> (II Samuel 12:11), and this prophecy was fulfilled through Absalom. <b>Similarly, you can say</b> about Joseph, who was sent by his father to inquire as to the well-being of his brothers, where the verse states: <b>“And he sent him from the valley [<i>emek</i>] of Hebron”</b> (Genesis 37:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: From the deep [<i>amukka</i>] counsel of that righteous individual who is interred in Hebron,</b> i.e., Abraham, <b>as it is written:</b> “And He said unto Abram: <b>Know that your seed shall be a stranger</b> in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13). The journey Joseph took to his brothers set in motion the descent of the Jewish people to Egypt. |
| Genesis 15:13 | four hundred years, as it is stated: “And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years” | Sotah 46b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One who walks along the way without</b> having someone to <b>accompany</b> him <b>should occupy himself with</b> words of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to words of Torah: <b>“For they shall be a chaplet of grace to your head, and chains around your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9). <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>says: Due to four steps that Pharaoh accompanied Abraham, as it is stated: “And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him,</b> and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had” (Genesis 12:20), Pharaoh <b>enslaved</b> Abraham’s <b>descendants</b> for <b>four hundred years, as it is stated: “And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years”</b> (Genesis 15:13). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who accompanies his friend four cubits in a city will come to no harm</b> by accompanying him. The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina accompanied Rava bar Yitzḥak four cubits in a city. He came close to harm, but he was saved.</b> |
| Genesis 15:15 | Go in peace, as it is stated: “But you shall go to your fathers in peace” | Berakhot 64a:10 | <b>Rabbi Avin HaLevi also said: One who takes leave from a dead person should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather,</b> one should say: <b>Go in peace, as it is stated: “But you shall go to your fathers in peace”</b> (Genesis 15:15). |
| Genesis 15:15 | One who departs from the deceased should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather: Go in peace, as it is stated: “And you shall go to your fathers in peace; | Moed Katan29a:3 | <b>One who departs from the deceased should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather: Go in peace, as it is stated: “And you shall go to your fathers in peace;</b> you shall be buried in a good old age” (Genesis 15:15). |
| Genesis 16:3 | after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan, | Yevamot 64a:5 | <b>Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for the matter</b> that one must take another wife if he has not had children after ten years of marriage, there is <b>an allusion to the matter,</b> as the verse states: “And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar…<b>after Abram had dwelled ten years in the land of Canaan,</b> and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife” (Genesis 16:3). Incidentally, this verse also comes <b>to teach you that</b> the years spent <b>dwelling outside of Eretz Yisrael do not count</b> as part of <b>his tally. Consequently,</b> if <b>he was sick</b> during this period <b>or she was sick, or</b> if one of <b>the two of them</b> was <b>imprisoned in jail,</b> it <b>does not count</b> as part of <b>his tally.</b> |
| Genesis 16:5 | is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you, | Bava Kamma93a:3 | § In connection with the incident of Abraham and Abimelech mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Rabbi Ḥanan says: One who passes</b> the <b>judgment of another</b> to Heaven <b>is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you,</b> I gave my handmaid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: The Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. <b>And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only in a situation <b>where he has</b> someone to do <b>judgment</b> for him <b>on earth</b> and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court. |
| Genesis 16:5 | as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you; | Rosh Hashanah16b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins,</b> and <b>they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting next to <b>an inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse; <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of one’s status and merit; <b>and passing a case against another</b> to Heaven, <b>for Rabbi Avin said: Anyone who passes a case against another</b> to God <b>is punished first.</b> Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, <b>as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you;</b> I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let the Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), <b>and it is written</b> afterward: <b>“And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2). Sarah called upon Heaven to pass judgment between her and her husband, and therefore she was punished and died first. |
| Genesis 16:8 | “And he said: Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from where did you come and to where are you going? And she said: I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai” | Bava Kamma92b:5 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated:</b> If <b>your friend calls you a donkey, prepare a saddle for your back,</b> i.e., do not contest his statement? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> in the conversation between the angel and Hagar: <b>“And he said: Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from where did you come and to where are you going? And she said: I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai”</b> (Genesis 16:8). Though Hagar was no longer the maidservant of Sarai, since the angel referred to her as such, she responded in kind. |
| Genesis 16:16 | How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram” | Megillah 17a:1 | <b>Why were the years of Ishmael mentioned</b> in the Torah? For what purpose were we told the life span of that wicked man? <b>In order to reckon through them the years of Jacob. As it is written: “And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years”</b> (Genesis 25:17). <b>How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram”</b> (Genesis 16:16). <b>And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him”</b> (Genesis 21:5). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). Based on these verses, <b>how old was Ishmael when Jacob was born? Seventy-four. How many of his years remained</b> then until his death? <b>Sixty-three,</b> as Ishmael died at the age of a hundred and thirty-seven. |
| Genesis 17:1 | El Shaddai | Chagigah 12a:15 | <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said,</b> with regard to the same matter: <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world, it continued to expand like two balls of a warp,</b> whose cord lengthens as they unravel, <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, rebuked it and made it stand still, as it is stated: “The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke”</b> (Job 26:11). <b>And this is</b> the same as that which <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I am the Almighty God</b> [<b><i>El Shaddai</i></b>]” (Genesis 17:1)? It means: <b>I am He Who said to the world “enough [dai],”</b> instructing it to stop expanding. Similarly, <b>Reish Lakish said: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the sea, it continued to expand until the Holy One, Blessed be He, rebuked it and made it dry, as it is stated: “He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and desiccates all the rivers”</b> (Nahum 1:4). |
| Genesis 17:1 | “Walk before Me and be wholehearted” | Makkot 24a:4 | The Gemara analyzes these verses: <b>“He who walks wholeheartedly”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like our forefather <b>Abraham, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Walk before Me and be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1). |
| Genesis 17:1 | “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” | Nedarim 31b:11 | <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that it overrides</b> the prohibitions associated with <b>leprosy.</b> If leprosy is found on the foreskin of an infant, although it is generally prohibited to cut the afflicted area, it is permitted to do so to perform the mitzva of circumcision. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that</b> despite <b>all the mitzvot that Abraham our Patriarch did,</b> he <b>was not called wholehearted until he circumcised</b> himself, <b>as it is stated</b> at the time that the mitzva was given to him: <b>“Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1). |
| Genesis 17:1 | as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” | Nedarim 32a:11 | <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said: Anyone who acts wholeheartedly, time will stand for him,</b> i.e., he will be successful, <b>as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), <b>and it is written: “And you shall be the father of a multitude of nations”</b> (Genesis 17:4). |
| Genesis 17:1 | circumcision, as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” | Nedarim 32a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, for there is no one who was engaged in mitzvot like Abraham our Patriarch, and</b> yet <b>he was called wholehearted only due to</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“And I will make My covenant between Me and you”</b> (Genesis 17:2), and Abraham was then commanded with regard to circumcision. This indicates that he was not called wholehearted until he performed circumcision. |
| Genesis 17:1 | Rav said: At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham our Patriarch: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” | Nedarim 32a:8 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham our Patriarch: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), a sensation of <b>trembling seized him</b> and <b>he said: Perhaps there is something disgraceful about me</b> due to a transgression that I committed, and therefore I cannot be called complete. <b>When</b> God <b>said to him: “And I will make My covenant between Me and you”</b> (Genesis 17:2), <b>his mind was set at ease,</b> since he understood that the removal of the foreskin that he was now commanded to do was the reason he had not yet achieved completion. |
| Genesis 17:2 | “And I will make My covenant between Me and you” | Nedarim 32a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, for there is no one who was engaged in mitzvot like Abraham our Patriarch, and</b> yet <b>he was called wholehearted only due to</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“And I will make My covenant between Me and you”</b> (Genesis 17:2), and Abraham was then commanded with regard to circumcision.

| Genesis 17:2 | said to him: “And I will make My covenant between Me and you” | Nedarim 32a:8 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham our Patriarch: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), a sensation of <b>trembling seized him</b> and <b>he said: Perhaps there is something disgraceful about me</b> due to a transgression that I committed, and therefore I cannot be called complete. <b>When</b> God <b>said to him: “And I will make My covenant between Me and you”</b> (Genesis 17:2), <b>his mind was set at ease,</b> since he understood that the removal of the foreskin that he was now commanded to do was the reason he had not yet achieved completion. |
| Genesis 17:4 | and it is written: “And you shall be the father of a multitude of nations” | Nedarim 32a:11 | <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said: Anyone who acts wholeheartedly, time will stand for him,</b> i.e., he will be successful, <b>as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1), <b>and it is written: “And you shall be the father of a multitude of nations”</b> (Genesis 17:4). |
| Genesis 17:5 | he became the father of the entire world, | Berakhot 13a:5 | The Gemara explains: <b>Initially he became a father,</b> a minister, and prominent person, only <b>to Aram,</b> so he was called Abram, father [av] of Aram, <b>and ultimately</b> with God’s blessing <b>he became the father of the entire world,</b> so he was called Abraham, father of the masses [<i>av hamon</i>], as it is stated: “I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5). |
| Genesis 17:5 | bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham” | Berakhot 13a:8 | Also, with regard to Abraham’s name, <b>bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5). This is a positive mitzva to refer to him as Abraham. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who calls Abraham Abram <b>transgresses a negative mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name shall no longer be called Abram,</b> and your name will be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5). |
| Genesis 17:5 | it is written “Abraham” | Nedarim 32b:1 | The letters of the term <b>the Satan [<i>haSatan</i>] in numerical value</b> is <b>364,</b> which equals the number of days of the year, except for Yom Kippur, during which he has no power. <b>And Rami bar Abba said: It is written “Abram,” and</b> after he was commanded to perform circumcision <b>it is written “Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5). <b>Initially the Holy One, Blessed be He, enthroned him</b> as ruler <b>over 243 limbs,</b> which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abram. <b>And in the end,</b> after he was circumcised, <b>He enthroned him</b> as ruler <b>over 248 limbs,</b> which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abraham. |
| Genesis 17:5 | for the father of a multitude of nations [ av hamon goyim ] have I made you” | Shabbat 105a:2 | We learned in the mishna If <b>one wrote one letter</b> as <b>an abbreviation [<i>notarikon</i>]</b> representing an entire word, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>language of abbreviation</b> is employed <b>in the Torah? As it is stated:</b> “Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; <b>for the father of a multitude of nations [<i>av hamon goyim</i>] have I made you”</b> (Genesis 17:5). The verse itself contracts <i>av hamon</i> into Abraham [<i>Avraham</i>]. The words <i>av hamon</i> themselves are interpreted as an abbreviation: <b>I have made you a father [<i>av</i>] for the nations, I have made you chosen [<i>baḥur</i>] among the nations, I have made you beloved [<i>ḥaviv</i>] among the nations, I have made you king [<i>melekh</i>] for the nations, I have made you distinguished [<i>vatik</i>] for the nations, I have made you trusted [<i>ne’eman</i>] for the nations.</b> |
| Genesis 17:7 | generations | Shabbat 132a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>generations</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “Throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant” (Exodus 31:16), and the word <b>generations</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And I shall establish My covenant between Me and you, and between your seed after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant” (Genesis 17:7). |
| Genesis 17:7 | is written with regard to Abraham: “To be a God to you and to your seed after you” | Yevamot 100b:9 | <b>Rav Pappa strongly objects to this: However, if that is so, since</b> the same phrase <b>is written with regard to Abraham: “To be a God to you and to your seed after you”</b> (Genesis 17:7), <b>what is the Merciful One warning him there?</b> Can it possibly mean that one who cannot identify his parents is not obligated to serve God as a Jew? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what He said to him: You may not marry a gentile woman or a maidservant, so that</b> the status of <b>your offspring will not follow her</b> status, as the child of a Jewish man and a gentile woman or maidservant receives the status of his mother. |
| Genesis 17:7 | “To be a God to you and your seed after you” | Yevamot 42a:6 | <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“To be a God to you and your seed after you”</b> (Genesis 17:7), which indicates that the Divine Presence rests with someone only when his seed can be identified as being descended from him, i.e., there are no uncertainties with regard to their lineage. Therefore, to prevent any uncertainties concerning the lineage of her child, the woman must wait so that it will be possible <b>to distinguish between the seed of the first</b> husband <b>and the seed of the second</b> husband. After three months, if she has conceived from her previous husband, the pregnancy will already be noticeable. |
| Genesis 17:7 | causes the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “To be a God to you and to your seed after you” | Yevamot 64a:2 | <b>Abba Ḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> A man who does not engage in procreation is <b>liable to death, as it is stated</b> with regard to the sons of Aaron: “And Nadav and Avihu died…<b>and they had no children”</b> (Numbers 3:4). This indicates that if they would have <b>had children they would not have died. Others say:</b> He <b>causes the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “To be a God to you and to your seed after you”</b> (Genesis 17:7). <b>When your seed is after you,</b> i.e., when you have children, <b>the Divine Presence rests</b> upon the Jewish people, but if <b>your seed is not after you, upon whom</b> can the Divine Presence <b>rest? Upon wood and stones?</b> |
| Genesis 17:9 | And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, | Avodah Zarah26b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> for circumcision to be performed by <b>an Aramean? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile that</b> it <b>is not valid?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). “My covenant [<i>beriti</i>]” here is a reference to circumcision [<i>berit mila</i>], and therefore the verse is teaching that only Abraham and his descendants, i.e., Jews, are qualified to perform circumcision. |
| Genesis 17:9 | And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, | Avodah Zarah27a:5 | The Gemara cites a proof that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi a gentile is not qualified to perform circumcision. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile that</b> it <b>is not valid? The verse states:</b> “And God said to Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). |
| Genesis 17:9 | And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, | Menachot 42a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>Is there reason</b> to resolve the contradiction <b>according to</b> anyone <b>but Rav? Rav</b> himself <b>invalidates</b> circumcision performed by a gentile, <b>as it was stated: From where</b> is it derived <b>that circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile</b> is <b>not valid? Daru bar Pappa says in the name of Rav:</b> This is derived from the verse: “And God said unto Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). The verse indicates that only the descendants of Abraham may perform circumcision. |
| Genesis 17:9 | “And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, | Sanhedrin 59b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, which was stated with regard to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., Abraham and his descendants, who had the status of descendants of Noah at that time? <b>As it is written</b> that God said to Abraham with regard to the mitzva of circumcision: <b>“And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai</b> for the Jewish people: <b>“And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), and nevertheless <b>it was stated for the Jewish people</b> alone <b>and not for the descendants of Noah.</b> |
| Genesis 17:9 | “And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations” | Sanhedrin 59b:9 | <b>If you wish, say</b> that there is another explanation for the fact that the mitzva of <b>circumcision</b> does not apply to the descendants of Noah despite the fact that it was repeated for the Jewish people: <b>From the outset, it was Abraham,</b> and not all the descendants of Noah, <b>that the Merciful One commanded to</b> perform this mitzva; as He said to him: <b>“And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations”</b> (Genesis 17:9). The Gemara infers: <b>“You and your offspring,” yes; another person, no.</b> |
| Genesis 17:10 | as it is written: “Every male among you shall be circumcised” | Kiddushin 29a:11 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to circumcise</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where one’s father did not circumcise him the court is obligated to circumcise him,</b> i.e., if this obligation is not fulfilled by the father it applies to the community as a whole, <b>as it is written: “Every male among you shall be circumcised”</b> (Genesis 17:10), in the form of a general mitzva that does not apply only to the father. <b>And</b> in a case <b>where the court did not circumcise him</b> the son <b>is obligated to circumcise himself</b> when he reaches adulthood, <b>as it is written: “And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 17:10 | from where do we derive | Shabbat 132b:10 | The Gemara questions the derivation from the word flesh: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the circumcision of <b>an adult</b> who has not yet been circumcised, <b>as</b> the word <b>flesh is written with regard to</b> adults in the verse: “And an uncircumcised male who will not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from its people; My covenant he has broken” (Genesis 17:14). Similarly, it works out well with regard to <b>a minor</b> who is circumcised on the eighth day, as the superfluous word <b>flesh is also written</b> with regard to him. However, with regard to a person at an <b>intermediate</b> stage of life, i.e., a child who was not circumcised on the eighth day but has not yet reached majority, <b>from where do we derive</b> that his circumcision overrides leprosy? The Torah explicitly mandates his circumcision: “Circumcise for yourselves every male” (Genesis 17:10). However, that verse does not employ the term flesh. |
| Genesis 17:10 | Circumcise for yourselves every male” | Shabbat 137a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>circumcision,</b> with regard to which Rabbi Yehuda categorizes a hermaphrodite as a male in regard to its laws? The Gemara answers that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is written:</b> “This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: <b>Circumcise for yourselves every male”</b> (Genesis 17:10), and he interprets the phrase “every male” as an amplification including anyone who could possibly be included in the category of a male. |
| Genesis 17:11 | sign | Shabbat 132a:6 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>sign</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you” (Genesis 17:11), and <b>sign</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “However, you shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations” (Exodus 31:13). From this verbal analogy, it is derived that circumcision, which is a sign, may be performed even on Shabbat, which is itself a sign. |
| Genesis 17:11 | covenant | Shabbat 132a:8 | <b>Rather,</b> this principle is <b>derived</b> by means of a different verbal analogy from the word <b>covenant</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you” (Genesis 17:11), and the word <b>covenant</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “The children of Israel shall keep the Shabbat, to observe the Shabbat throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant” (Exodus 31:16). |
| Genesis 17:12 | he that is eight days old | Shabbat 132a:15 | Reish Lakish asked: <b>This</b> verse with regard to the mitzva of circumcision <b>is also necessary</b> to teach that circumcision must be performed <b>during the day and not at night.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan replied: <b>That</b> is derived <b>from</b> a different verse, which states: “And <b>he that is eight days old</b> shall be circumcised among you throughout your generations” (Genesis 17:12). That circumcision must take place during the day is derived from that verse. |
| Genesis 17:12 | he that is eight days old | Shabbat 132a:20 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This</b> usage of the term <b>eighth is necessary to exclude</b> the <b>seventh</b> day, i.e., a child may not be circumcised before the eighth day. The Gemara answers: The fact that one may not circumcise on the <b>seventh</b> day <b>is derived</b> from a different verse, as it is stated: “And <b>he that is eight days old</b> shall be circumcised among you throughout your generations” (Genesis 17:12). |
| Genesis 17:13 | “He must be circumcised [ himmol yimmol ]” | Avodah Zarah27a:6 | § It was stated that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda circumcision must be performed for the sake of fulfilling a mitzva, whereas Rabbi Yosei holds that no particular intention is necessary. The Gemara analyzes these opinions. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written:</b> “And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover <b>to the Lord let</b> all his males <b>be circumcised”</b> (Exodus 12:48). It can be inferred from the verse that the males must be circumcised “to the Lord,” i.e., for the sake of fulfilling God’s will. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is written: <b>“He must be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13). The usage of the doubled verb teaches that circumcision may be performed by anyone. |
| Genesis 17:13 | “Must be circumcised [ himmol yimmol ]” | Menachot 42a:19 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the doubled verb in the verse: <b>“Must be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13), which he interprets to mean: Only <b>one who is circumcised [<i>hammal</i>] may circumcise [<i>yamul</i>]</b> others. |
| Genesis 17:13 | as it is stated: “He must surely be circumcised [ himmol yimmol ]” | Yevamot 72a:7 | The Gemara explains: The <i>amora</i> who raised the question <b>erred due to the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He should not be circumcised because it would be dangerous for him</b> to do so. His colleagues <b>said to him: But weren’t</b> there <b>many</b> who had drawn their residual foreskins forward and subsequently <b>were circumcised</b> a second time <b>in the days of ben Koziva,</b> otherwise known as bar Kokheva, <b>and they fathered sons and daughters.</b> Such re-circumcision is necessary, <b>as it is stated: “He must surely be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13), the double verb form indicating: <b>Even one hundred times.

| Genesis 17:14 | shall be cut off | Kiddushin 29a:11 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to circumcise</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where one’s father did not circumcise him the court is obligated to circumcise him,</b> i.e., if this obligation is not fulfilled by the father it applies to the community as a whole, <b>as it is written: “Every male among you shall be circumcised”</b> (Genesis 17:10), in the form of a general mitzva that does not apply only to the father. <b>And</b> in a case <b>where the court did not circumcise him</b> the son <b>is obligated to circumcise himself</b> when he reaches adulthood, <b>as it is written: “And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 17:14 | he has broken My covenant” | Sanhedrin 38b:11 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Adam the first</b> man <b>was a heretic, as it is stated: “And the Lord called to the man and said to him: Where are you”?</b> (Genesis 3:9), meaning, to <b>where has your heart turned,</b> indicating that Adam turned from the path of truth. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: He was</b> one who <b>drew his foreskin</b> forward, so as to remove any indication that he was circumcised. It <b>is written here: “And they like men [<i>adam</i>] have transgressed the covenant”</b> (Hosea 6:7), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there:</b> “And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; <b>he has broken My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 17:14 | it is written: “He has violated My covenant” | Sanhedrin 44a:4 | <b>And Rabbi Ile’a says</b> further <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Masparta: Achan,</b> in addition to his other evil actions, <b>would stretch his</b> remaining <b>foreskin</b> in order to conceal the fact that he was circumcised. An allusion to this offense is found in the wording of this verse. <b>Here,</b> with regard to Achan, <b>it is written: “They have also transgressed My covenant,” and there,</b> with regard to circumcision, <b>it is written: “He has violated My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 17:14 | he has broken My covenant” | Sanhedrin 59b:12 | <b>Rav Oshaya objects to this: If that is so, the descendants of Keturah,</b> Abraham’s second wife, <b>should not be obligated</b> to observe circumcision. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says, and some say</b> that it is <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> who says that the verse: “And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; <b>he has broken My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14) is stated <b>to include the descendants of Keturah</b> in the obligation to observe circumcision. |
| Genesis 17:14 | as it says: “And an uncircumcised man who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin [ orlato ], | Shabbat 108a:10 | The Gemara comments: The issue mentioned above is in fact a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> It was asked in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that <i>circumcision</i></b> is performed <b>in that place?</b> It is <b>stated here,</b> in the case of circumcision, <b><i>orlato</i>. And</b> it is <b>stated there,</b> with regard to trees, <b><i>orlato</i>. Just as there</b> the Torah is referring to a tree, which <b>is an item that bears fruit, here too,</b> <i>orla</i> is referring to <b>an item that bears fruit;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. Rabbi Natan says:</b> This verbal analogy <b><i>is not necessary</i></b>, <b>as it says: “And an uncircumcised man who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin [<i>orlato</i>],</b> his soul will be cut off from his nation, he has broken My covenant” (Genesis 17:14). From the fact that it says: An uncircumcised man, it is derived that circumcision is in the <b>place that distinguishes between a male and a female.</b> |
| Genesis 17:14 | flesh is written with regard to | Shabbat 132b:10 | The Gemara questions the derivation from the word flesh: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the circumcision of <b>an adult</b> who has not yet been circumcised, <b>as</b> the word <b>flesh is written with regard to</b> adults in the verse: “And an uncircumcised male who will not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from its people; My covenant he has broken” (Genesis 17:14). Similarly, it works out well with regard to <b>a minor</b> who is circumcised on the eighth day, as the superfluous word <b>flesh is also written</b> with regard to him. However, with regard to a person at an <b>intermediate</b> stage of life, i.e., a child who was not circumcised on the eighth day but has not yet reached majority, <b>from where do we derive</b> that his circumcision overrides leprosy? The Torah explicitly mandates his circumcision: “Circumcise for yourselves every male” (Genesis 17:10). However, that verse does not employ the term flesh. |
| Genesis 17:14 | “And an uncircumcised male who will not circumcise | Shabbat 133b:13 | <b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this:</b> This cannot be, as if so what is the <i>baraita</i> teaching? The fact that <b>an adult</b> is liable for <i>karet</i> is <b>explicitly written</b> in the verse: <b>“And an uncircumcised male who will not circumcise</b> the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from its people; My covenant he has broken” (Genesis 17:14). <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> it refers to the <b>craftsman</b> who performed the partial circumcision on Shabbat, <b>and</b> it is a case <b>where he came</b> to perform the circumcision <b>at twilight</b> on <b>Shabbat</b> day, just before the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>and</b> those present <b>said to him: You will not manage</b> to complete the circumcision before the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>and he said to them: I will manage. And he performed</b> the circumcision <b>and did not manage</b> to complete the mitzva before Shabbat ended. <b>It turns out that he made a wound</b> in the child but did not fulfill the mitzva. <b>And</b> since he was forewarned not to do so, he is therefore <b>punishable by <i>karet</i></b> like anyone who violates Shabbat not for the purpose of performing a mitzva. |
| Genesis 17:14 | it says: “He has broken My covenant” | Yevamot 72a:7 | The Gemara explains: The <i>amora</i> who raised the question <b>erred due to the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He should not be circumcised because it would be dangerous for him</b> to do so. His colleagues <b>said to him: But weren’t</b> there <b>many</b> who had drawn their residual foreskins forward and subsequently <b>were circumcised</b> a second time <b>in the days of ben Koziva,</b> otherwise known as bar Kokheva, <b>and they fathered sons and daughters.</b> Such re-circumcision is necessary, <b>as it is stated: “He must surely be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13), the double verb form indicating: <b>Even one hundred times. And</b> furthermore, <b>it says: “He has broken My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14), which comes <b>to include one</b> whose foreskin was <b>drawn forward.</b> |
| Genesis 17:15 | your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name” | Berakhot 13a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> in the case of Sarah, it is not a general mitzva, rather <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham</b> alone: “And God said to Abraham, <b>your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name”</b> (Genesis 17:15). In contrast, this is stated regarding Abraham in general terms: “Your name shall no longer be called Abram.” |
| Genesis 17:15 | Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be” | Rosh Hashanah16b:6 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person’s sentence is torn up on</b> account of <b>four</b> types of <b>actions. These are:</b> Giving <b>charity, crying out</b> in prayer, <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, and a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better. An allusion may be found in Scripture for all of them: Giving <b>charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2); <b>crying out</b> in prayer, <b>as it is written: “Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses”</b> (Psalms 107:28); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, as it is written:</b> “As for <b>Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be”</b> (Genesis 17:15), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her”</b> (Genesis 17:16); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better, <b>as it is written: “And God saw their deeds”</b> (Jonah 3:10), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And God repented of the evil, which He had said He would do to them, and He did not do</b> it” (Jonah 3:10). |
| Genesis 17:16 | “And I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her” | Rosh Hashanah16b:6 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person’s sentence is torn up on</b> account of <b>four</b> types of <b>actions.

| Genesis 17:17 | Iscah, because all gazed [ sokhim ] upon her beauty. And it is written: “And Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart: | Sanhedrin 69b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Iscah is</b> in fact <b>Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? Because she envisioned [<i>shesokha</i>]</b> hidden matters <b>by means of divine inspiration. And this</b> explains <b>what is written: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice”</b> (Genesis 21:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> Sarah was also called <b>Iscah, because all gazed [<i>sokhim</i>] upon her beauty. And it is written: “And Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart:</b> Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?” (Genesis 17:17). <b>How much older was Abraham than Sarah?</b> He was <b>ten years</b> older than her <b>and,</b> as stated above, he was <b>two years older than her father,</b> Haran. <b>It turns out</b> then that <b>when Haran begot Sarah, he begot her at</b> the age of <b>eight.</b> |
| Genesis 18:1 | “And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day” | Bava Metzia86b:17 | § The Gemara expounds another verse involving Abraham: <b>“And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day”</b> (Genesis 18:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“the heat of the day”? Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: That day was the third day after Abraham’s circumcision, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, came to inquire</b> about the well-being <b>of Abraham. The Holy One, Blessed be He, removed the sun from its sheath in order not to bother that righteous one with guests,</b> i.e., God made it extremely hot that day to allow Abraham to recover from his circumcision, as he would not be troubled by passing travelers whom he would invite into his tent. |
| Genesis 18:1 | says: “In the heat of the day” | Berakhot 27a:10 | The <i>baraita </i>continues: Do <b>you say</b> that the time when the sun grew hot was <b>at four hours, or</b> perhaps <b>it was only at six hours</b> of the day? <b>When</b> the verse <b>says: “In the heat of the day”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>six hours is</b> already <b>mentioned</b> in the Torah as the heat of the day. <b>How, then, do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“And when the sun grew hot it melted”?</b> This must refer to an earlier time, <b>at four hours.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna? It is <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda nor the Sages. If</b> it was in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, until four hours is also</b> considered <b>morning,</b> as he holds that the daily morning offering may still be sacrificed then, while here it says that in the morning the manna was gathered and it melted after the morning. <b>If</b> it was in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, until noon is also</b> considered <b>morning,</b> since, according to the Sages, the daily morning offering could be sacrificed until noon. Apparently, this is an entirely new position. |
| Genesis 18:1 | “And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre” | Sotah 14a:4 | He explains: <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that one should follow the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> He provides several examples. <b>Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you clothe the naked.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, visits the sick, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: <b>“And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you visit the sick.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, consoles mourners, as it is written: “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son”</b> (Genesis 25:11), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you console mourners.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you bury the dead.</b> |
| Genesis 18:2 | This is as it is written: “And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood over him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them” | Bava Metzia86b:19 | <b>Once</b> God <b>saw</b> Abraham <b>tying and untying</b> the bandage on his circumcision, God <b>said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to stand here,</b> i.e., it is not respectful to Abraham even for God to stand there. <b>This is as it is written: “And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood over him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them”</b> (Genesis 18:2). The verse first states that they stood over him, and then it says that he ran to meet them. The Gemara reconciles this apparent contradiction: <b>Initially, they came and stood over him. Upon seeing that he was in pain, they said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to stand here.</b> |
| Genesis 18:3 | do not leave Your servant” | Bava Metzia86b:18 | Despite the intense heat, Abraham wanted to invite guests. <b>He sent Eliezer</b> his slave <b>to go outside</b> to see if there were any passersby. Eliezer <b>went out but did not find</b> anyone. Abraham <b>said to him: I do not believe you.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> demonstrates the popular adage <b>that</b> people <b>there,</b> i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, <b>say: Slaves do not have any credibility.</b> The Gemara continues: Abraham <b>himself went out and saw the Holy One, Blessed be He, standing at the entrance</b> to his tent. <b>This is as it is written:</b> “My Lord, if now I have found favor in your eyes, <b>do not leave Your servant”</b> (Genesis 18:3), i.e., God’s presence was there, and Abraham asked Him for permission to attend to the travelers. |
| Genesis 18:3 | it is written: “And he said: Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please pass not | Shabbat 127a:13 | We learned in the mishna: One may move baskets of produce <b>due to the guests</b> and in order to prevent the suspension of Torah study in the study hall. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Hospitality</b> toward <b>guests is as great as rising early</b> to go <b>to the study hall, as</b> the mishna equates them <b>and teaches: Due to the guests and due to suspension of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall. And Rav Dimi from Neharde’a says:</b> Hospitality toward guests is <b>greater than rising early to the study hall, as it teaches: Due to the guests, and</b> only <b>afterward: And due to suspension of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> on a related note: <b>Hospitality</b> toward <b>guests is greater than receiving the Divine Presence, as</b> when Abraham invited his guests <b>it is written: “And he said: Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please pass not</b> from Your servant” (Genesis 18:3). Abraham requested that God, the Divine Presence, wait for him while he tended to his guests appropriately. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like that of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> people is such that <b>a less significant</b> person <b>is unable to say to a more significant</b> person: <b>Wait until I come to you, while with regard to the Holy One, Blessed be He, it is written: “And he said: Lord, if now I have found favor</b> in Your sight, please pass not from Your servant.” Abraham requested that God wait for him due to his guests. |
| Genesis 18:3 | which is non-sacred, as it is stated: “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes” | Shevuot 35b:9 | <b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated in the Torah with regard to Abraham</b> are <b>sacred</b> and are referring to God, <b>except for this</b> name, <b>which is non-sacred, as it is stated: “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes”</b> (Genesis 18:3). In that passage, Abraham is addressing the angels who appeared to him in the guise of men, not God. |
| Genesis 18:4 | “Let now a little water be fetched” | Bava Metzia86b:14 | By contrast, Abraham performed certain actions through an agent. He said: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched”</b> (Genesis 18:4), and correspondingly the verse states in reference to Moses, God’s messenger: <b>“And you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink”</b> (Exodus 17:6). |
| Genesis 18:4 | “Let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet” | Bava Metzia86b:16 | The Gemara continues its analysis of the verse: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet”</b> (Genesis 18:4). <b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, said</b> that the guests <b>said to</b> Abraham: <b>Are you suspicious that we are Arabs who bow to the dust of their feet? Yishmael has already issued from him,</b> i.e., your own son acts in this manner. |
| Genesis 18:5 | as it is written: “So do, as you have said” | Bava Metzia86b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to</b> the incident involving <b>Abraham,</b> where the angels acquiesced immediately to his request to remain with him, <b>as it is written: “So do, as you have said”</b> (Genesis 18:5), <b>and what is different with regard to Lot,</b> where they first displayed reluctance, <b>as it is written:</b> |
| Genesis 18:5 | It is written: “And I will fetch a morsel of bread, | Bava Metzia87a:2 | The Gemara continues analyzing the same passage. <b>It is written: “And I will fetch a morsel of bread,</b> and satisfy your heart” (Genesis 18:5), <b>and it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd,</b> and fetched a calf tender and good” (Genesis 18:7). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> we learn <b>that</b> the <b>righteous say little and do much,</b> whereas the <b>wicked say much and do not do even a little.</b> |
| Genesis 18:5 | “Then [ aḥar ] go on” | Nedarim 37b:8 | <b>The ornamentation of the scribes</b> are expressions that the scribes understood in a manner that differs slightly from its plain understanding. For example: <b>“Then [<i>aḥar</i>] go on”</b> (Genesis 18:5); <b>“then [<i>aḥar</i>] she will go”</b> (Genesis 24:55); <b>“afterward [<i>aḥar</i>] you will be gathered”</b> (Numbers 31:2); <b>“the singers go before, the minstrels follow after [<i>aḥar</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:26); <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains”</b> (Psalms 36:7). |
| Genesis 18:6 | It is written: “Knead it, and make cakes” | Bava Metzia87a:5 | The Gemara continues its analysis of the verses. <b>It is written: “Knead it, and make cakes”</b> (Genesis 18:6), and two verses later <b>it is written: “And he took curd, and milk, and the calf</b> which he prepared” (Genesis 18:8). Abraham served these items to the guests, <b>and yet he did not bring bread before them</b> despite having instructed Sarah to prepare baked goods. |
| Genesis 18:7 | “And Abraham ran to the herd” | Bava Metzia86b:12 | The Gemara elaborates: With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd”</b> (Genesis 18:7), bringing the meat himself, and in reference to God’s actions for Abraham’s descendants the verse states: <b>“And there went forth a wind from the Lord,</b> and brought across quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31), that God brought meat to them. In reference to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he took curd and milk”</b> (Genesis 18:8), and God says to the Jewish people: <b>“Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4), which shows that God gave food to the Jewish people. |
| Genesis 18:7 | reasoned: Perhaps he will feast with me today. But with regard to Abraham, it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good” | Bava Metzia86b:3 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> further <b>says:</b> King <b>Solomon had one thousand wives, each one of whom would prepare for him at her home</b> a feast of <b>such</b> proportions. <b>What is the reason</b> that they did this? <b>This</b> wife <b>reasoned: Perhaps he will feast with me today, and that</b> wife <b>reasoned: Perhaps he will feast with me today. But with regard to Abraham, it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good”</b> (Genesis 18:7), <b>and Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says,</b> in explanation of the verse: <b>“A calf”</b> indicates <b>one;</b> the word <b>“tender”</b> means an additional one, i.e., <b>two; “and good”</b> indicates yet another one. This makes a total of <b>three</b> calves, a considerably smaller feast than that of Solomon. |
| Genesis 18:7 | “And Abraham ran to the herd, | Bava Metzia86b:7 | The Gemara returns to discuss the verse in Genesis: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd,</b> and fetched a calf tender and good” (Genesis 18:7). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: “A calf”</b> is <b>one; “tender”</b> indicates an additional one, i.e., <b>two; “and good”</b> indicates another one, for a total of <b>three</b> calves. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the verse is referring to only <b>one</b> calf, <b>as people say</b> when describing a single item that it is <b>tender and good?</b> |
| Genesis 18:7 | “And he gave it to the servant; and he hastened to prepare it” | Bava Metzia86b:9 | <b>Rabba bar Ulla raises an objection, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Hoshaya, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Natan, son of Rabbi Hoshaya,</b> who raises the objection: The verse states: <b>“And he gave it to the servant; and he hastened to prepare it”</b> (Genesis 18:7). The singular term “it” indicates that there was only one calf. The Gemara answers: Abraham <b>gave each and every</b> calf <b>to one servant,</b> i.e., he gave the three calves to three different servants. The Gemara raises a question from the verse: <b>“And he took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them”</b> (Genesis 18:8), which again indicates that there was only one calf. The Gemara responds: The verse means <b>that as each calf arrived</b> prepared, <b>he brought it before them,</b> and he did not serve all three calves at once. |
| Genesis 18:7 | and it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd, | Bava Metzia87a:2 | The Gemara continues analyzing the same passage. <b>It is written: “And I will fetch a morsel of bread,</b> and satisfy your heart” (Genesis 18:5), <b>and it is written: “And Abraham ran to the herd,</b> and fetched a calf tender and good” (Genesis 18:7). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> we learn <b>that</b> the <b>righteous say little and do much,</b> whereas the <b>wicked say much and do not do even a little.</b> |
| Genesis 18:8 | “And he took curd and milk” | Bava Metzia86b:12 | The Gemara elaborates: With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd”</b> (Genesis 18:7), bringing the meat himself, and in reference to God’s actions for Abraham’s descendants the verse states: <b>“And there went forth a wind from the Lord,</b> and brought across quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31), that God brought meat to them. In reference to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he took curd and milk”</b> (Genesis 18:8), and God says to the Jewish people: <b>“Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4), which shows that God gave food to the Jewish people. |
| Genesis 18:8 | “And he stood by them under the tree, | Bava Metzia86b:13 | With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he stood by them under the tree,</b> and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: <b>“Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock</b> in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: <b>“And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way”</b> (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). |

| Genesis 18:8 | generation and it is written about him: “And he stood over them | Kiddushin 32b:5 | Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: We found</b> one <b>greater than him who served</b> his guests, as our forefather <b>Abraham</b> was <b>greater than him and he served</b> his guests. <b>Abraham was the greatest</b> man <b>of</b> his <b>generation and it is written about him: “And he stood over them</b> under the tree, and they ate” (Genesis 18:8). <b>And lest you say:</b> His guests <b>appeared to him as ministering angels,</b> and that is why he honored them, in fact <b>they appeared to him only as Arabs. And</b> if so, <b>should not the esteemed Rabban Gamliel stand over us and serve us drinks?</b> |
| Genesis 18:9 | “And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife? And he said: Behold, in the tent” | Bava Metzia87a:7 | The next verse states: <b>“And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife? And he said: Behold, in the tent”</b> (Genesis 18:9). The Gemara explains that this verse serves <b>to inform</b> us <b>that Sarah, our foremother, was a modest woman,</b> as she remained inside while the guests were present. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who says: <b>The ministering angels,</b> who visited Abraham in the guise of travelers, <b>knew that Sarah, our foremother, was inside the tent. Rather, what</b> was the purpose of their eliciting Abraham’s response: <b>In the tent?</b> It was <b>in order to endear her to her husband,</b> by accentuating Sarah’s modesty. |
| Genesis 18:9 | The verse states: “And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife? | Yevamot 77a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>In any case,</b> the unanswered question raised by Doeg is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they explained</b> the matter based on the verse: <b>“The king’s daughter is all glorious within”</b> (Psalms 45:14), which indicates that it is unbefitting for a woman to venture outside at all, and therefore the Ammonite women would not have been expected to go forth to meet the Jewish women. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who said: <b>The verse states: “And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife?</b> And he said: Behold, in the tent” (Genesis 18:9), which teaches that it is praiseworthy for a woman to remain inside her home. |
| Genesis 18:12 | “And my lord is old” | Bava Metzia87a:10 | <b>It is written</b> that Sarah said: <b>“And my lord is old”</b> (Genesis 18:12), <b>and it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I certainly bear a child, <b>and I am old?”</b> (Genesis 18:13). This verse indicates that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not repeat</b> to Abraham <b>that</b> which Sarah actually <b>said,</b> that her husband is old. Why did God change the wording of her statement so that she was referring to herself? |
| Genesis 18:12 | After I am waxed old [ veloti ] shall I have pleasure [ edna ]” | Bava Metzia87a:9 | The Gemara analyzes the verses that describe Sarah at the time: “And Sarah laughed within herself, saying: <b>After I am waxed old [<i>veloti</i>] shall I have pleasure [<i>edna</i>]”</b> (Genesis 18:12). <b>Rav Ḥisda says: After the skin had worn out [<i>nitballa</i>] and become full of wrinkles, the skin once again became soft [<i>nitadden</i>] and her wrinkles smoothed out, and</b> Sarah’s <b>beauty returned to its place.</b> |
| Genesis 18:12 | Come, let me go down, and there confound their language. | Megillah 9a:14 | Instead of: “Come, let us go down, and there confound their language” (Genesis 11:7), which indicates multiple authorities, they wrote in the singular: <b>Come, let me go down, and there confound their language.</b> In addition, they replaced the verse: “And Sarah laughed within herself [<i>bekirba</i>]” (Genesis 18:12), with: <b>And Sarah laughed among her relatives [<i>bikroveha</i>].</b> They made this change to distinguish between Sarah’s laughter, which God criticized, and Abraham’s laughter, to which no reaction is recorded. Based on the change, Sarah’s laughter was offensive because she voiced it to others. |
| Genesis 18:12 | days of ritual impurity, | Rosh Hashanah11a:14 | The Gemara asks further: But <b>still, can</b> a woman <b>give birth after</b> only <b>six months?</b> The Gemara answers: A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>That year was a leap year,</b> in which an additional month of Adar was added before Nisan, and a woman can indeed give birth after seven months. The Gemara raises another question: <b>Ultimately, if one deducts</b> Sarah’s <b>days of ritual impurity,</b> as when the angel spoke Sarah had not yet conceived, and there is a tradition that on that day she began menstruating, as is alluded to in the verse: “After I am grown old, shall I have pleasure” (Genesis 18:12), <b>there are less</b> than seven months. |
| Genesis 18:12 | “And my lord is old” | Yevamot 65b:9 | It was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Great is peace, as even the Holy One, Blessed be He, departed</b> from the truth for <b>it.

God adjusted Sarah’s words in order to spare Abraham hurt feelings that might lead Abraham and Sarah to quarrel. |
| Genesis 18:12 | “After I am grown old [ beloti ] shall I have pleasure?” | Yoma 83b:17 | <b>And in the end, they</b> too, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, <b>would analyze names. When they came to a house of</b> a landlord <b>named Bala, they did not enter. They said: Conclude from here that he is</b> certainly <b>wicked, as it is written: “I said of her who was worn out [<i>bala</i>] by adulteries”</b> (Ezekiel 23:43), <b>as</b> it states: <b>“After I am grown old [<i>beloti</i>] shall I have pleasure?”</b> (Genesis 18:12). “Worn out by adulteries” means <b>aged through adulteries.</b> |
| Genesis 18:13 | and I am old?” | Bava Metzia87a:10 | <b>It is written</b> that Sarah said: <b>“And my lord is old”</b> (Genesis 18:12), <b>and it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I certainly bear a child, <b>and I am old?”</b> (Genesis 18:13). This verse indicates that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not repeat</b> to Abraham <b>that</b> which Sarah actually <b>said,</b> that her husband is old. Why did God change the wording of her statement so that she was referring to herself? |
| Genesis 18:13 | “And I am old” | Yevamot 65b:9 | It was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Great is peace, as even the Holy One, Blessed be He, departed</b> from the truth for <b>it.

| Genesis 18:14 | “At the appointed time [ mo’ed ] I will return to you, | Rosh Hashanah11a:13 | It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Passover Isaac was born.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written</b> that the angel who informed Sarah that she would bear a son told Abraham: <b>“At the appointed time [<i>mo’ed</i>] I will return to you,</b> at this season, and Sarah shall have a son” (Genesis 18:14). This is understood to mean: At the time of the next Festival [<i>mo’ed</i>]. <b>When did</b> the angel say this? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>on Passover and he said to him</b> that Sarah would have a son <b>on <i>Shavuot</i>, can</b> a woman <b>give birth after</b> only <b>fifty days? Rather,</b> say <b>that it was <i>Shavuot</i> and he said</b> that she would give birth on the Festival that occurs <b>in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>. But <b>still, can she give birth after</b> only <b>five months? Rather,</b> you must say <b>that it was <i>Sukkot</i>, and he spoke about</b> the Festival that occurs <b>in</b> the month of <b>Nisan,</b> i.e., Passover. |
| Genesis 18:16 | “And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way” | Bava Metzia86b:13 | With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he stood by them under the tree,</b> and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: <b>“Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock</b> in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: <b>“And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way”</b> (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). |
| Genesis 18:17 | As it is written: “And God said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing?” | Yoma 38b:7 | <b>Ravina said to one of the Sages who would organize aggadic</b> statements <b>before him: From where is this matter that the Sages stated: The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing,</b> derived?<b> He said to him: As it is written</b> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <b>“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing.”</b> He then asked him: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive this? He said to him: <b>As it is written: “And God said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing?”</b> (Genesis 18:17). <b>And</b> as soon as Abraham’s name is mentioned, <b>it is written: “And Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation”</b> (Genesis 18:18), although there is no clear connection to the previous verse. Apparently, once the name of a righteous person is mentioned, it is followed directly by praise of the individual. That is the Torah source for the statement that the mention of the righteous is for blessing. |
| Genesis 18:18 | “All the nations of the earth | Yevamot 63a:6 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “And in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed [<i>nivrekhu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 12:3)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham: I have two good shoots to graft</b> [<b><i>lehavrikh</i></b>] <b>onto you: Ruth the Moabite,</b> the ancestress of the house of David, <b>and Naamah the Ammonite,</b> whose marriage with Solomon led to the ensuing dynasty of the kings of Judea. <b>“All the families of the earth”</b> means: <b>Even families that live in the earth,</b> i.e., who have land of their own, <b>are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b> Similarly, when the verse states: <b>“All the nations of the earth</b> shall be blessed in him” (Genesis 18:18), it indicates that <b>even ships that come from Galia to Hispania are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b> |
| Genesis 18:18 | it is written: “And Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation” | Yoma 38b:7 | <b>Ravina said to one of the Sages who would organize aggadic</b> statements <b>before him: From where is this matter that the Sages stated: The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing,</b> derived?<b> He said to him: As it is written</b> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <b>“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing.”</b> He then asked him: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive this?

Blessed are You,</b> Lord, <b>Who pays the just deserts.</b> |
| Genesis 18:19 | “For I have known him, that he will command | Makkot 24a:18 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>“He who walks righteously”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>our forefather Abraham, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“For I have known him, that he will command</b> his children…to perform righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). |
| Genesis 18:19 | “For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children | Sanhedrin 56b:5 | The verse is interpreted homiletically as follows: With regard to the term <b>“and…commanded,” these are the</b> courts of <b>judgment; and so it states</b> in another verse: <b>“For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children</b> and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). |
| Genesis 18:19 | “For I have known him, to the end that he may command | Sanhedrin 57b:7 | <b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to the statement in the book of <i>Aggadot</i> that a descendant of Noah can be judged or testified against only by a man and not by a woman: <b>And is a woman</b> who is a descendant of Noah <b>not commanded</b> to establish courts of judgment? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to Abraham, who at that point had the status of a descendant of Noah: <b>“For I have known him, to the end that he may command</b> his sons and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). The word “household” is referring to the women, indicating that they are also commanded to execute justice. |
| Genesis 18:19 | to the end that he may command his children and his household | Yevamot 79a:3 | David <b>said: There are three distinguishing marks of this nation,</b> the Jewish people. They are <b>merciful,</b> they are <b>shamefaced, and they perform acts of kindness.</b> <br>They are <b>merciful, as it is written: “And He will give you mercy, and have mercy upon you and multiply you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18); not only will God have mercy upon you, but He will bestow the attribute of mercy upon you. <br>They are <b>shamefaced, as it is written: “And that His fear shall be upon your faces”</b> (Exodus 20:17), and the fear that is on one’s face is his shame. <br><b>They perform acts of kindness, as it is written:</b> “For I have known him, <b>to the end that he may command his children and his household</b> after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to practice righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19), i.e., to perform acts of kindness. <br><b>Whoever has these three distinguishing marks is fit to cleave to this nation.</b> Those who lack these qualities, however, are unfit to be part of the Jewish people. When David saw the cruelty of the Gibeonites, he decreed that they may never enter into the congregation of Israel. |
| Genesis 18:19 | “For I have known him to the end that he will command | Yoma 38b:10 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked; and</b> conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous.</b> How so? <b>From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked, as it is written</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“For I have known him to the end that he will command</b> his children and his household after him” (Genesis 18:19), <b>and it is written thereafter: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great”</b> (Genesis 18:20). The righteousness of Abraham underscores the relative wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, exacerbating their punishment. |
| Genesis 18:20 | which is written: “And the Lord said: Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great [ rabba ]” | Sanhedrin 109b:9 | <b>There was a young woman who would take bread out to the poor people in a pitcher</b> so the people of Sodom would not see it. <b>The matter was revealed,</b> and <b>they smeared her with honey and positioned her on the wall</b> of the city, and <b>the hornets came and consumed her. And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the Lord said: Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great [<i>rabba</i>]”</b> (Genesis 18:20). <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> <i>Rabba</i> is an allusion to the <b>matter of the young woman [<i>riva</i>]</b> who was killed for her act of kindness. It is due to that sin that the fate of the people of Sodom was sealed. |
| Genesis 18:20 | and it is written thereafter: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great” | Yoma 38b:10 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked; and</b> conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous.</b> How so? <b>From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked, as it is written</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“For I have known him to the end that he will command</b> his children and his household after him” (Genesis 18:19), <b>and it is written thereafter: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great”</b> (Genesis 18:20). The righteousness of Abraham underscores the relative wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, exacerbating their punishment. |
| Genesis 18:25 | “That be far [ ḥalila ] from You to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked” | Avodah Zarah4a:15 | § The Gemara continues discussing the manner in which God metes out punishment. <b>Rabbi Abba Bar Kahana says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> as part of Abraham’s prayer to God, when God informed him that He was going to destroy Sodom: <b>“That be far [<i>ḥalila</i>] from You to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked”</b> (Genesis 18:25)? This is what <b>Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, it is a sacrilege [<i>ḥullin</i>] for You to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked.</b> |
| Genesis 18:26 | then I will spare the entire place for their sakes” | Sanhedrin 99b:18 | <b>Abaye said to him: That</b> person who questions the benefit provided by Sages is <b>also</b> in the category of one <b>who interprets the Torah</b> inappropriately, since with that statement he repudiates the Torah itself, <b>as it is written: “If not for My covenant, I would not have appointed day and night, the laws of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). The eternal covenant of the Torah is responsible for maintaining the existence of the entire world. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: From here too conclude</b> the same concept <b>from it, as it is stated:</b> “If I find in Sodom fifty just men within the city, <b>then I will spare the entire place for their sakes”</b> (Genesis 18:26). The righteous protect the place where they reside. |
| Genesis 18:27 | which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust [ afar ] and ashes” | Chullin 88b:10 | § The Gemara cites aggadic accounts relating to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>Rava says: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust [<i>afar</i>] and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27), <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> (see Numbers, chapter 19) <b>and the dust of the <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., dirt taken from the ground of the Tabernacle that is mixed into the water that examines whether or not a woman committed adultery (see Numbers 5:17). |
| Genesis 18:27 | he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes” | Chullin 89a:6 | <b>I granted greatness to Abraham,</b> yet <b>he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). I granted greatness <b>to Moses and Aaron,</b> yet Moses <b>said</b> of the two of them: <b>“And what are we”</b> (Exodus 16:7). I granted greatness <b>to David,</b> yet <b>he said: “But I am a worm, and no man”</b> (Psalms 22:7). |
| Genesis 18:27 | dust and ashes” | Sotah 17a:17 | Additionally, <b>Rava says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say: Bring dust for the <i>sota</i>?</b> It is because if <b>she merits</b> to be proven faithful after drinking the water of the <i>sota</i>, <b>a child like our Patriarch Abraham will emerge from her, as it is written with regard to</b> Abraham that he said: “I am but <b>dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). But <b>if she does not merit</b> to be proven faithful after drinking the water of the <i>sota</i>, <b>she shall</b> die and <b>return to her dust,</b> the soil from which mankind was formed. |
| Genesis 18:27 | which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust and ashes” | Sotah 17a:18 | And <b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27), <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> (see Numbers, chapter 19) <b>and the dust of the <i>sota</i>.</b> |
| Genesis 19:1 | But it is written: “And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening” | Bava Metzia86b:20 | The Gemara continues: <b>Who are these three men?</b> They are the angels <b>Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael: Michael, who came to announce</b> to <b>Sarah</b> that she was to give birth to a son; <b>Raphael, who came to heal Abraham</b> after his circumcision; and <b>Gabriel,</b> who <b>went to overturn Sodom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written: “And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening”</b> (Genesis 19:1). The Gemara answers <b>that Michael went along with</b> Gabriel to Sodom <b>to save Lot.</b> The Gemara notes: The language <b>is also precise, as it is written: “And he overturned those cities”</b> (Genesis 19:25), <b>and it is not written: They overturned</b> those cities. <b>Conclude from it</b> that only one angel overturned Sodom. |
| Genesis 19:3 | “And he urged them greatly” | Bava Metzia87a:1 | <b>“And he urged them greatly”</b> (Genesis 19:3), only after which they acquiesced? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From here</b> we learn <b>that one may decline</b> the request of <b>a lesser man, but one may not decline</b> the request of <b>a great man.</b> |
| Genesis 19:15 | it is written: “Your two daughters that are found | Bava Batra91b:10 | <b>“Who had dominion in Moab,”</b> this means <b>that they married Moabite women. “And Jashubi Lehem,” this</b> is referring to <b>Ruth the Moabite, who returned [<i>sheshava</i>] and attached</b> herself <b>to Bethlehem</b> of <b>Judea. “And the matters are ancient,”</b> this means that <b>these matters were said by the Ancient of Days,</b> i.e., they occurred through God’s will, <b>as it is written: “I have found David My servant”</b> (Psalms 89:21); <b>and</b> the same term “found” also appears with regard to the daughters of Lot, as <b>it is written: “Your two daughters that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15). This teaches that David’s ancestry can be traced this far back, as he was destined to be born from Moab, who was the son of Lot’s daughter and Lot himself. |
| Genesis 19:15 | As it is written: “And when the morning arose, the angels hastened Lot, | Pesachim 93b:13 | The Gemara addresses the previously mentioned discussion: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>from dawn until sunrise</b> one can walk a distance of <b>five <i>mil</i>. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And when the morning arose, the angels hastened Lot,</b> saying: Arise, take your wife and your two daughters that are here, lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city” (Genesis 19:15), <b>and it is written: “The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar”</b> (Genesis 19:23). Therefore, the distance between Sodom and Zoar is the distance one can walk between dawn and sunrise, <b>and Rabbi Ḥanina said: I myself saw that place, and it is</b> a distance of <b>five <i>mil</i>.</b> This serves as a biblical proof that one can walk five <i>mil</i> between dawn and sunrise. |
| Genesis 19:15 | that are found | Yevamot 77a:7 | With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Then I said: Behold, I have come; in the scroll of a book it is written about me”</b> (Psalms 40:8)? <b>David said: I</b> had <b>said</b> that <b>I have come</b> only <b>now;</b> my life was created only recently, at the time of my birth. <b>But I did not know that it was</b> already <b>written about me in the scroll of a book,</b> that an ancient text already hints at my existence. <b>There,</b> with regard to the daughters of Lot, <b>it is written:</b> “And your two daughters <b>that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15), and <b>here,</b> with regard to David, <b>it is written: “I have found David, My servant; I have anointed him with My holy oil”</b> (Psalms 89:21). The lost article that was found among the daughters of Lot, the mothers of Ammon and Moab, is David and his royal house. |
| Genesis 19:20 | “Behold, here is this city that is close to run away to and it is small” | Shabbat 10b:8 | <b>And Rava bar Meḥasseya said that Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said Rav said: A person should always seek and dwell in a city whose settling</b> took place in the <b>recent</b> past, meaning that it was recently established, <b>as due to the fact that its settling is recent its sins are few,</b> as its residents have not yet had the opportunity to commit many sins there. <b>As it is stated</b> that Lot said to the angel: <b>“Behold, here is this city that is close to run away to and it is small”</b> (Genesis 19:20). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>close? If you say: That it is close</b> in distance <b>and</b> truly <b>small,</b> why did he need to say that to the angel? <b>Didn’t they see it? Rather,</b> the meaning of the word close must be <b>because its settling was close,</b> that it had been recently settled, and therefore <b>its sins were few. Rabbi Avin said: What is the verse</b> that teaches us that Zoar was newer than the other cities? <b>As it is written: “I will escape there please [<i>na</i>]”</b> (Genesis 19:20); the <b>numerological value</b> of <b><i>nun alef</i></b>, the letters of the word <i>na</i>, is <b>fifty-one, while Sodom</b> was <b>fifty-two</b> years old. <b>And</b> Sodom’s <b>tranquil</b> period |
| Genesis 19:23 | and it is written: “The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar” | Pesachim 93b:13 | The Gemara addresses the previously mentioned discussion: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>from dawn until sunrise</b> one can walk a distance of <b>five <i>mil</i>.

| Genesis 19:24 | as, with regard to Sodom, it is written: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom | Sanhedrin 104b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“It is nothing to you, all you who pass by”</b> (Lamentations 1:12), <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From here</b> there is a source <b>from the Torah for complaint,</b> i.e., it is appropriate for one to make his suffering public so that others will have compassion for him. With regard to the phrase <b>“all you who pass by,” Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that it is as though Jerusalem said: <b>They have rendered me like</b> a city of <b>those who violate the</b> most fundamental <b>precepts</b> of law and morality, <b>as, with regard to Sodom, it is written: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom</b> brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven” (Genesis 19:24), <b>while with regard to Jerusalem, it is written: “From above He has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails</b> against them” (Lamentations 1:13). In both cities, fire rained down from Heaven. <b>And it is written: “For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom”</b> (Lamentations 4:6). |
| Genesis 19:24 | is written: “And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord | Sanhedrin 38b:21 | The Gemara relates: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei:</b> It <b>is written: “And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord</b> out of heaven” (Genesis 19:24). The heretic raised the question: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>From Him</b> out of heaven. <b>A certain launderer said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>Leave him be; I will respond to him.</b> This is <b>as it is written: “And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lemech,</b> hearken to my speech” (Genesis 4:23). One can raise the question: <b>It should have</b> been written: <b>My wives,</b> and not: “Wives of Lemech.” <b>Rather, it is</b> the style of <b>the verse</b> to <b>speak in this</b> manner. <b>Here too, it is</b> the style of <b>the verse</b> to <b>speak in this</b> manner. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> the launderer: <b>From where did you</b> hear <b>this</b> interpretation? The launderer <b>said to him: I heard it at the lecture of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Genesis 19:25 | is also precise, as it is written: “And he overturned those cities” | Bava Metzia86b:20 | The Gemara continues: <b>Who are these three men?</b> They are the angels <b>Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael: Michael, who came to announce</b> to <b>Sarah</b> that she was to give birth to a son; <b>Raphael, who came to heal Abraham</b> after his circumcision; and <b>Gabriel,</b> who <b>went to overturn Sodom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written: “And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening”</b> (Genesis 19:1). The Gemara answers <b>that Michael went along with</b> Gabriel to Sodom <b>to save Lot.</b> The Gemara notes: The language <b>is also precise, as it is written: “And he overturned those cities”</b> (Genesis 19:25), <b>and it is not written: They overturned</b> those cities. <b>Conclude from it</b> that only one angel overturned Sodom. |
| Genesis 19:26 | Lot’s wife, as it is stated: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt” | Berakhot 54b:8 | <b>And</b> one must recite a blessing upon seeing <b>Lot’s wife, as it is stated: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt”</b> (Genesis 19:26). <b>And the wall of Jericho that was swallowed, as it is written: “And the wall fell down flat”</b> (Joshua 6:20). |
| Genesis 19:26 | the wife of Lot, | Niddah 70b:7 | The Gemara lists the <b>three matters of ignorance</b> that the sages of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the wife of Lot,</b> who was turned into a pillar of salt as she fled from the city of Sodom (Genesis 19:26), in terms of whether <b>she transmits ritual impurity</b> as a corpse? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: A corpse transmits ritual impurity, but a pillar of salt,</b> even if it was formerly a person, <b>does not impart ritual impurity.</b> |
| Genesis 19:27 | “And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood | Berakhot 26b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated</b> when Abraham came to look out over Sodom the day after he had prayed on its behalf: <b>“And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before the Lord” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> from the context as well as the language utilized in the verse, the verb <b>standing</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer,</b> as this language is used to describe Pinehas’ prayer after the plague, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed</b> and the plague ended” (Psalms 106:30). Clearly, Abraham was accustomed to stand in prayer in the morning. |
| Genesis 19:27 | As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood | Berakhot 6b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Abraham our father set a fixed place</b> for his prayer? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before God” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> the verb <b>“standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30). |
| Genesis 19:28 | Rav Yehuda said to Rabba bar Rav Yitzḥak: I will explain to you the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: “And behold, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace” | Menachot 26b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said to Rabba bar Rav Yitzḥak: I will explain to you the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: “And behold, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace”</b> (Genesis 19:28), and <b>a furnace does not release smoke until the fire takes hold of the majority of</b> the fuel. Rabbi Yoḥanan derived from this verse that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire, since the priests are instructed to make the handful smoke, as it is written: “And the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2). |
| Genesis 19:29 | remembers the righteous, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt” | Berakhot 54b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches that for all of these one must give <b>thanks and</b> offer <b>praise?</b> The Gemara answers: The language of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended <b>and teach: Over Lot and his wife one recites two blessings. Over his wife he recites: Blessed…the true Judge, and on Lot he recites: Blessed…Who remembers the righteous.</b> As <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> From the story of Lot it is possible to learn that <b>even during a time of wrath of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> He <b>remembers the righteous, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt”</b> (Genesis 19:29). |
| Genesis 19:33 | elder | Horayot 10b:12 | The Gemara asks: Why is Lot accused of wrongdoing? <b>Wasn’t he</b> the victim of <b>circumstances beyond his control,</b> as he was drunk and asleep? It is <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥoni: Why is it dotted over</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> that</b> is in the word <b>“<i>bekumah</i>”</b> written with regard to Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter in the verse: “And he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose [<i>bekumah</i>]” (Genesis 19:33)? It is <b>to say to you that when she lay down he did not know; but when she arose, he knew.</b> Therefore, his action was not completely beyond his control. The Gemara asks: <b>And what was he to do? What was, was.</b> The Gemara answers: He should have <b>derived from it that on the following night he should not drink.</b> Since he drank again, this indicates that he did so with intent to engage in intercourse with his other daughter. |
| Genesis 19:33 | elder | Nazir 23a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Lot <b>was forced</b> to participate in the sexual intercourse, as he was asleep at the time; how can he be considered a sinner? The Gemara answers that this is as a Sage <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Rav Ḥoni: Why is there a dot</b> in a Torah scroll <b>over</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b>“<i>uvekumah</i>,” with regard to</b> Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter, in the verse: “And he did not know when she lay down and when she arose [<i>uvekumah</i>]” (Genesis 19:33)? This dot serves <b>to say that when she lay down he did not know; however, when she arose he knew</b> what she had done, as he later understood what had happened. |
| Genesis 20:3 | “She is a man’s wife” | Ketubot 61a:3 | <b>And we answered his</b> question <b>from this</b> amoraic statement: When a woman marries a man, <b>she ascends with him</b> to his socioeconomic status, if it is higher than hers, <b>but she does not descend with him</b> if his status is lower. Consequently, if his family is not accustomed to nurse, she is not obligated to nurse either. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is derived from: <b>“She is a man’s wife”</b> (Genesis 20:3). The Gemara explains: The word used here for “wife [<i>be’ula</i>]” hints through similar spelling that she ascends in status <b>with the ascension [<i>aliya</i>] of her husband but does not</b> descend <b>with the descent of her husband. Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There is a hint to this principle <b>from here: “As she was the mother of all living”</b> (Genesis 3:20), which indicates that <b>she was given</b> to her husband <b>for living</b> with him, <b>but was not given to</b> suffer <b>pain</b> with him. |
| Genesis 20:3 | You shall die for the woman you took, | Makkot 9a:9 | <b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> from that which is written with regard to Abimelech, king of Gerar, who took Sarah, Abraham’s wife: “And God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him: <b>You shall die for the woman you took,</b> as she is a man’s wife” (Genesis 20:3). When Abimelech took Sarah he was under the impression that she was unmarried, as Abraham said that she was his sister. Despite the fact that Abimelech was one who says that it is permitted, he was liable to be executed for his action. <b>What, is it not</b> that he was liable to be executed <b>at the hand of</b> a court composed of <b>people,</b> indicating that one who says that it is permitted is liable? |
| Genesis 20:4 | “Will You even slay a righteous nation?” | Makkot 9a:12 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from the reply of Abimelech: <b>“Will You even slay a righteous nation?”</b> (Genesis 20:4). God appears to accept Abimelech’s contention, as He did not respond by calling him wicked, indicating that one who says that it is permitted to perform a transgression is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. The Gemara rejects that understanding. <b>There,</b> the reason for the rejection of Abimelech’s contention <b>is as they responded to him</b> from Heaven: <b>“And now, restore the man’s wife, as he is a prophet”</b> (Genesis 20:7). |
| Genesis 20:6 | from sinning against Me” | Makkot 9a:10 | The Gemara rejects that conclusion: <b>No,</b> it means that he was liable to be executed <b>at the hand of Heaven,</b> but not by a court. The Gemara adds: The language of the verses <b>is also precise</b> in this regard, <b>as it is written:</b> “And I also prevented you <b>from sinning against Me”</b> (Genesis 20:6), indicating that it was a sin vis-à-vis God and was not in the jurisdiction of a court of men. |
| Genesis 20:7 | “Now therefore restore the wife | Bava Kamma92a:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the assailant who caused damage <b>gives to</b> the victim all of the required payments for the injury, his transgression is <b>not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated</b> that God told Abimelech after he had taken Sarah from Abraham: <b>“Now therefore restore the wife</b> of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live” (Genesis 20:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the victim <b>does not forgive him that he is cruel? As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech,</b> and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17). |
| Genesis 20:7 | as it is stated: “Restore the wife of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you” | Bava Kamma92a:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: All these</b> sums <b>that</b> in the previous mishna <b>they said</b> one is liable to pay for humiliating another are the <b>compensation for his humiliation,</b> for which there is a set amount. <b>But</b> for the victim’s <b>pain</b> caused by the assailant, <b>even if</b> the assailant <b>brings</b> as offerings <b>all the rams of Nebaioth</b> (see Isaiah 60:7) <b>that are in the world,</b> which are of the best quality, his transgression <b>is not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated: “Restore the wife of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you”</b> (Genesis 20:7). |
| Genesis 20:7 | “And now, restore the man’s wife, as he is a prophet” | Makkot 9a:12 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from the reply of Abimelech: <b>“Will You even slay a righteous nation?”</b> (Genesis 20:4). God appears to accept Abimelech’s contention, as He did not respond by calling him wicked, indicating that one who says that it is permitted to perform a transgression is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. The Gemara rejects that understanding. <b>There,</b> the reason for the rejection of Abimelech’s contention <b>is as they responded to him</b> from Heaven: <b>“And now, restore the man’s wife, as he is a prophet”</b> (Genesis 20:7). |
| Genesis 20:7 | “And now, restore the man’s wife” | Makkot 9b:2 | <b>Rather,</b> the explanation is <b>as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This</b> is what God <b>is saying to</b> Abimelech: <b>“And now, restore the man’s wife”</b> (Genesis 20:7), <b>in any case,</b> whether or not he is a prophet. <b>And</b> as for <b>that which you said: “Will You even slay a righteous nation? Didn’t he say to me: She is my sister”</b> (Genesis 20:4–5), claiming that you are a victim of circumstances beyond your control and exempt from punishment, that is not a valid claim. <b>He is a prophet and</b> it is <b>from you</b> that <b>he learned</b> to conduct himself in that manner. With regard to <b>a stranger [<i>akhsenai</i>] who comes to the city, one asks him about matters of eating and drinking,</b> e.g., whether he is hungry or thirsty. <b>Does one ask him:</b> Is <b>that your wife?</b> Is <b>that your sister?</b> Abraham understood from this line of questioning that you are suspect with regard to abducting women, and that is the reason that he introduced Sarah as his sister. Therefore, you are liable to be executed for her abduction. |
| Genesis 20:12 | “And moreover, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; | Sanhedrin 58b:5 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer from what Abraham said to Abimelech with regard to Sarah: <b>“And moreover, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother;</b> and so she became my wife” (Genesis 20:12). <b>By inference, the daughter of the mother</b> of a descendant of Noah <b>is forbidden</b> to him. |
| Genesis 20:16 | as it is stated: “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes” | Bava Kamma93a:5 | The Gemara provides another lesson from the story of Abraham and Abimelech. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The curse of an ordinary person should never be</b> regarded as <b>light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah and it was fulfilled in her descendant.</b> The curse on Sarah is <b>as it is stated: “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes”</b> (Genesis 20:16), meaning that <b>he said to her: Since you concealed</b> your status <b>from me and you did not reveal that</b> Abraham <b>is your husband, and you caused me this suffering, may it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should have children with covered eyes. And</b> this curse <b>was fulfilled in her descendant, as it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see”</b> (Genesis 27:1). |
| Genesis 20:16 | “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes | Megillah 15a:18 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One should not regard the curse of an ordinary person as light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah,</b> saying: <b>“Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes</b> to all that are with you” (Genesis 20:16), <b>and</b> indeed <b>this was fulfilled in her descendant,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,</b> so that he could not see” (Genesis 27:1). Abimelech’s curse of covered eyes was fulfilled through her son Isaac’s blindness. |
| Genesis 20:16 | “Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes” | Megillah 28a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Did this cause</b> Isaac’s blindness? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak say: A curse of an ordinary person should not be lightly regarded in your eyes, because Abimelech cursed Sarah, and</b> although he was not a righteous man, his curse <b>was</b> nevertheless <b>fulfilled,</b> albeit <b>in her descendant. As it is stated</b> that Abimelech said to Sarah with regard to the gift that he gave to Abraham: <b>“Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes”</b> (Genesis 20:16). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“a covering [<i>kesut</i>]</b> of the eyes,” but <b>rather</b> read it as: <b>A blindness [<i>kesiat</i>] of the eyes.</b> Abimelech’s words were a veiled curse for Sarah to suffer from blindness. While she herself did not suffer, the curse was apparently fulfilled in the blindness of her son, Isaac. |
| Genesis 20:17 | “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants, | Bava Kamma92a:16 | Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Writings, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants,</b> and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately following that: <b>“And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said”</b> (Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: <b>As Abraham said with regard to Abimelech.</b> Because Abraham prayed for Abimelech that the women of his household should give birth, Abraham himself was answered concerning that matter. |
| Genesis 20:17 | does not forgive him that he is cruel? As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, | Bava Kamma92a:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the assailant who caused damage <b>gives to</b> the victim all of the required payments for the injury, his transgression is <b>not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated</b> that God told Abimelech after he had taken Sarah from Abraham: <b>“Now therefore restore the wife</b> of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live” (Genesis 20:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the victim <b>does not forgive him that he is cruel? As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech,</b> and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17). |
| Genesis 20:18 | “For the Lord had obstructed [ atzor atzar ] | Bava Kamma92a:11 | Having mentioned the verses concerning the incident of Abraham and Abimelech, the Gemara explains other related verses. <b>“For the Lord had obstructed [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> all the wombs of the house of Abimelech” (Genesis 20:18). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Why</b> are <b>these two obstructions [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> both stated? <b>One</b> is stated <b>with regard to a man,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged, and <b>two</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged from her, <b>and</b> that she will not give <b>birth.</b> |
| Genesis 20:18 | as it is stated: “For the Lord has fast closed up all the wombs” | Taanit 8b:1 | Reish Lakish elaborates: <b>Closing up is stated with regard to a woman</b> who cannot give birth, <b>as it is stated: “For the Lord has fast closed up all the wombs”</b> (Genesis 20:18), <b>and closing up is stated with regard to rains, as it is written: “And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17). |
| Genesis 21:1 | “And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said” | Bava Kamma92a:16 | Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Writings, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants,</b> and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately following that: <b>“And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said”</b> (Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: <b>As Abraham said with regard to Abimelech.</b> Because Abraham prayed for Abimelech that the women of his household should give birth, Abraham himself was answered concerning that matter. |
| Genesis 21:1 | For example: “And the Lord revisited [ pakad ] Sarah” | Rosh Hashanah32b:5 | Verses that mention God’s <b>revisitings [<i>pikdonot</i>] are</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances [<i>zikhronot</i>],</b> and therefore they may be counted in the ten verses. <b>For example: “And the Lord revisited [<i>pakad</i>] Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and, for example: “I have surely revisited [<i>pakadeti</i>] you”</b> (Exodus 3:16). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: They are not</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances.</b> |
| Genesis 21:1 | with a woman, as it is written: “And the Lord remembered Sarah” | Taanit 8b:3 | Lastly, an expression of <b>remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>remembering is</b> also <b>stated</b> in connection <b>to rain. Remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, as it is written: “And the Lord remembered Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>to rain, as it is written: “You have remembered the earth and have watered it; greatly enriching it, with the pool of God that is full of water”</b> (Psalms 65:10). |
| Genesis 21:4 | as it is written: “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac” | Kiddushin 29a:11 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to circumcise</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where one’s father did not circumcise him the court is obligated to circumcise him,</b> i.e., if this obligation is not fulfilled by the father it applies to the community as a whole, <b>as it is written: “Every male among you shall be circumcised”</b> (Genesis 17:10), in the form of a general mitzva that does not apply only to the father. <b>And</b> in a case <b>where the court did not circumcise him</b> the son <b>is obligated to circumcise himself</b> when he reaches adulthood, <b>as it is written: “And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Genesis 17:14). |
| Genesis 21:4 | as God commanded him” | Kiddushin 29a:12 | <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> his mother <b>is not obligated</b> to circumcise her son? <b>As it is written:</b> “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, <b>as God commanded him”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The verse emphasizes that God commanded <b>him, and not her.</b> |
| Genesis 21:5 | And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him” | Megillah 17a:1 | <b>Why were the years of Ishmael mentioned</b> in the Torah? For what purpose were we told the life span of that wicked man? <b>In order to reckon through them the years of Jacob. As it is written: “And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years”</b> (Genesis 25:17). <b>How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram”</b> (Genesis 16:16). <b>And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him”</b> (Genesis 21:5). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). Based on these verses, <b>how old was Ishmael when Jacob was born? Seventy-four. How many of his years remained</b> then until his death? <b>Sixty-three,</b> as Ishmael died at the age of a hundred and thirty-seven. |
| Genesis 21:7 | “And she said: Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah should nurse children?” | Bava Metzia87a:12 | In reference to Sarah having given birth to Isaac, the verse states: <b>“And she said: Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah should nurse children?”</b> (Genesis 21:7). The Gemara asks: <b>How many children did Sarah nurse?</b> Why does the verse use the plural form when she had only one child? <b>Rabbi Levi says: That day when Abraham weaned his son Isaac, he prepared a great</b> celebratory <b>feast. All of the nations of the world were gossiping and saying</b> to each other: <b>See</b> this <b>old man and old woman who brought a foundling from the market and are saying: He is our son, and moreover they are making a great feast to bolster their claim.</b> |
| Genesis 21:8 | which is written: “And the child grew and was weaned [ vayiggamal ], | Pesachim 119b:4 | In connection to its discussion of <i>hallel</i>, the Gemara cites a statement that <b>Rav Avira taught. Sometimes he said</b> this exposition <b>citing Rav Ami, and sometimes he said</b> it <b>citing Rav Asi: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the child grew and was weaned [<i>vayiggamal</i>],</b> and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned” (Genesis 21:8)? <b>In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will prepare a feast for the righteous on the day that He extends [<i>sheyigmol</i>] His mercy to the descendants of Isaac. After they eat and drink,</b> the celebrants will <b>give Abraham our father a cup of blessing to recite the blessing,</b> as he is the first of our forefathers. |
| Genesis 21:8 | after the statement [ devarav ] of Satan, as it is written: “And the child grew, and was weaned, | Sanhedrin 89b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra:</b> This means <b>after the statement [<i>devarav</i>] of Satan, as it is written: “And the child grew, and was weaned,</b> and Abraham prepared a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned” (Genesis 21:8). <b>Satan said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, this old man, you favored him with a product of the womb,</b> i.e., a child, <b>at one hundred years</b> of age. <b>From the entire feast that he prepared, did he not have</b> even <b>one dove or one pigeon to sacrifice before You</b> as a thanks-offering? God <b>said to</b> Satan: <b>Did</b> Abraham <b>prepare</b> the feast for any reason <b>but for his son? If I say to him: Sacrifice your son before Me,</b> he would <b>immediately slaughter him. Immediately,</b> after these matters, the verse states: <b>“And God tried Abraham.”</b> |
| Genesis 21:9 | after the statement of Ishmael to Isaac, | Sanhedrin 89b:14 | The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the verse: “And it came to pass after these matters that God tried Abraham” (Genesis 22:1). <b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> This means <b>after the statement of Ishmael to Isaac,</b> during an exchange between them described in the verse: “And Sarah saw the son of Hagar…mocking” (Genesis 21:9). <b>Ishmael said to Isaac: I am greater than you in</b> the fulfillment of <b>mitzvot, as you were circumcised</b> at the <b>age of eight days,</b> without your knowledge and without your consent, <b>and I</b> was circumcised at the <b>age of thirteen years,</b> with both my knowledge and my consent. Isaac <b>said to</b> Ishmael: <b>And do you provoke me with one organ? If the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> were to <b>say to me: Sacrifice yourself before Me, I</b> would <b>sacrifice</b> myself. <b>Immediately, God tried Abraham,</b> to confirm that Isaac was sincere in his offer to give his life. |
| Genesis 21:12 | Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? For she saw [ sakhta ] by means of divine inspiration, as it is stated: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice” | Megillah 14a:13 | § The Gemara asks with regard to the prophetesses recorded in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who were the seven prophetesses?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Huldah, and Esther.</b> The Gemara offers textual support: <b>Sarah, as it is written:</b> “Haran, <b>the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah”</b> (Genesis 11:29). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Iscah is</b> in fact <b>Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? For she saw [<i>sakhta</i>] by means of divine inspiration, as it is stated: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice”</b> (Genesis 21:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> Sarah was also called <b>Iscah, for all gazed [<i>sokhin</i>] upon her beauty.</b> |
| Genesis 21:12 | “For in Isaac shall seed be called to you” | Nedarim 31a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the mishna’s ruling that the one who takes such a vow is permitted to derive benefit from the nations of the world, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there Ishmael</b> and his descendants, who are also Abraham’s offspring? Why isn’t deriving benefit from them forbidden as well? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“For in Isaac shall seed be called to you”</b> (Genesis 21:12), which demonstrates that the descendants of Ishmael are not termed the offspring of Abraham. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there Esau</b> and his descendants; they are also offspring of Abraham, since they are descendants of Isaac? The Gemara answers that the words <b>“in Isaac”</b> mean that some of Isaac’s descendants, i.e., the children of Jacob, are included in the offspring of Abraham, <b>but not all</b> the descendants of <b>Isaac.</b> |
| Genesis 21:12 | “For through Isaac, offspring shall be called yours” | Sanhedrin 59b:10 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, the descendants of Ishmael should</b> also <b>be obligated</b> to observe circumcision, as they are also the offspring of Abraham. The Gemara explains: The verse states: <b>“For through Isaac, offspring shall be called yours”</b> (Genesis 21:12), which means that Ishmael’s descendants are not called the offspring of Abraham. |
| Genesis 21:12 | what is written: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice” | Sanhedrin 69b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Iscah is</b> in fact <b>Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? Because she envisioned [<i>shesokha</i>]</b> hidden matters <b>by means of divine inspiration. And this</b> explains <b>what is written: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice”</b> (Genesis 21:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> Sarah was also called <b>Iscah, because all gazed [<i>sokhim</i>] upon her beauty. And it is written: “And Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart:</b> Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?” (Genesis 17:17). <b>How much older was Abraham than Sarah?</b> He was <b>ten years</b> older than her <b>and,</b> as stated above, he was <b>two years older than her father,</b> Haran. <b>It turns out</b> then that <b>when Haran begot Sarah, he begot her at</b> the age of <b>eight.</b> |
| Genesis 21:17 | “For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is” | Rosh Hashanah16b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A man is judged only according to his deeds at the time</b> of his judgment, and not according to his future deeds, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Ishmael: <b>“For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is”</b> (Genesis 21:17). Although Ishmael and his descendants would act wickedly in the future, his prayer was heard and answered because he was innocent at the time. |
| Genesis 21:23 | administered an oath to Abraham: “That you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson” | Chullin 60b:12 | The verse teaches the following: <b>Since Abimelech,</b> king of the Philistines, <b>administered an oath to Abraham: “That you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson”</b> (Genesis 21:23), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of the Philistines until four generations had passed. Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let</b> the <b>Caphtorim come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from</b> the <b>Avvim, who are</b> the same as the <b>Philistines, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from the Caphtorim,</b> circumventing the prohibition. |
| Genesis 21:23 | that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; | Sotah 10a:1 | Samson’s parents were being told that <b>the oath of Abimelech,</b> king of the Philistines, <b>was negated, as it is written</b> that Abimelech said to our forefather Abraham: “Now therefore swear unto me here by God <b>that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son;</b> but according to the kindness that I have done unto you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned” (Genesis 21:23). The oath of the descendants of Abraham was no longer binding since the Philistines broke their oath by subjugating the Jewish people. |
| Genesis 21:33 | “And he planted an eshel in Beersheba, | Sotah 10a:21 | The Gemara discusses Abraham’s house: It is written: <b>“And he planted an <i>eshel</i> in Beersheba,</b> and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God” (Genesis 21:33). <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Abraham <b>made an orchard and planted in it all kinds of sweet things.</b> |
| Genesis 21:33 | and called there [ vayyikra ] on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God” | Sotah 10a:23 | The verse there states: “And he planted an <i>eshel</i> in Beersheba, <b>and called there [<i>vayyikra</i>] on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God”</b> (Genesis 21:33). <b>Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> this word literally as <b>“<i>vayyikra</i>,”</b> and he called, |
| Genesis 22:1 | “And it came to pass after these matters [ hadevarim ] that God tried Abraham” | Sanhedrin 89b:8 | § Apropos the binding of Isaac, the Gemara elaborates: It is written: <b>“And it came to pass after these matters [<i>hadevarim</i>] that God tried Abraham”</b> (Genesis 22:1). The Gemara asks: <b>After what</b> matters? How does the binding of Isaac relate to the preceding events? |
| Genesis 22:2 | “And He said: Take, please [ na ], your son” | Sanhedrin 89b:10 | The Torah continues: <b>“And He said: Take, please [<i>na</i>], your son”</b> (Genesis 22:2). <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba says:</b> The word <b><i>na</i> is nothing other than an expression of entreaty.</b> Why did God request rather than command that Abraham take his son? The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who confronted many wars. And he had one warrior</b> fighting for him, <b>and he overcame</b> his enemies. <b>Over time,</b> there was <b>a fierce war confronting him.</b> The king <b>said to</b> his warrior: <b>I entreat you, stand</b> firm <b>for me in this war,</b> so <b>that</b> others <b>will not say: There is no substance in the first</b> victories, and you are not a true warrior. Likewise, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, also said to Abraham: I have tried you with several ordeals, and you have withstood them all. Now, stand</b> firm <b>in this ordeal for Me, so that</b> others <b>will not say: There is no substance in the first</b> ordeals. |
| Genesis 22:3 | from here: “And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled | Chullin 91b:2 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled</b> his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had told him” (Genesis 22:3). The fact that Abraham waited until morning and did not set off at night, even though others were traveling with him, indicates that a Torah scholar should not go out at night at all, and certainly not alone. |
| Genesis 22:3 | “And Abraham arose early in the morning” | Pesachim 4a:6 | <b>And lest you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>the vigilant are early</b> in the performance <b>of mitzvot, let us search in the morning.</b> The principle: The vigilant are early in the performance of mitzvot, is derived, <b>as it is written: “And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire day is suitable for</b> performance of the mitzva of <b>circumcision; however, the vigilant are early</b> in the performance <b>of mitzvot,</b> and circumcise in the morning. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the binding of Isaac: <b>“And Abraham arose early in the morning”</b> (Genesis 22:3) after hearing God’s command. This indicates that Abraham arose early in his eagerness to perform God’s commandment. |
| Genesis 22:3 | from Abraham, as it is written: “And Abraham rose early in the morning | Sanhedrin 105b:11 | § It is stated: <b>“And Balaam rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey”</b> (Numbers 22:21). <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: Love negates the standard</b> conduct <b>of</b> those of <b>prominence.</b> This is derived <b>from Abraham, as it is written: “And Abraham rose early in the morning</b> and saddled his donkey” (Genesis 22:3). Atypically, he saddled the donkey himself and he did not wait for his servants. Likewise, <b>hatred negates the standard</b> conduct <b>of</b> those of <b>prominence.</b> This is derived <b>from Balaam, as it is stated: “And Balaam rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey”</b> (Numbers 22:21). |
| Genesis 22:3 | “And Abraham arose early in the morning and saddled | Yoma 28b:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> And will <b>we arise and derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from Abraham?</b> Didn’t Abraham live before the Torah was given to the Jewish people, and therefore <i>halakhot</i> cannot be derived from his conduct? <b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> derived</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from Abraham’s</b> conduct, <b>and we do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from his</b> conduct? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), this verse <b>teaches that the entire day is suitable for</b> performance of the mitzva of <b>circumcision. However, the vigilant are early</b> in their performance of <b>mitzvot</b> and circumcise in the morning, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the binding of Isaac: <b>“And Abraham arose early in the morning and saddled</b> his donkey” (Genesis 22:3). He awakened early to fulfill the mitzva without delay. Apparently, <i>halakha</i> is derived from the conduct of Abraham. |
| Genesis 22:5 | “You remain here with [ im ] the donkey” | Bava Kamma49a:5 | <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In the case of <b>an ox that gored</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant, and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, the owner <b>pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring. What is the reason?</b> The ox <b>injured a mere pregnant donkey.</b> With regard to the matter of compensation for offspring, who would be the property of the master were they to be born, a Canaanite slave is considered property of the master. <b>As</b> the <b>verse states</b> that Abraham addressed Eliezer, who was a Canaanite, by saying: <b>“You remain here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5), on which the Sages expound that he was alluding to the idea that Eliezer is of <b>a people [<i>am</i>] that is similar to a donkey.</b> Therefore, the case of an ox goring a Canaanite maidservant is not included in the Torah’s exemption from paying compensation for miscarried offspring. |
| Genesis 22:5 | the World-to-Come. It is written here: “To the people [ la’am ] upon it,” and it is written there: “Abide you here with [ im ] the donkey” | Ketubot 111a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Abba bar Memel do with this</b> verse <b>“He gives breath to the people upon it”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> that verse <b>for that</b> which was taught by <b>Rabbi Abbahu. As Rabbi Abbahu said: Even a Canaanite maidservant in Eretz Yisrael is assured</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come. It is written here: “To the people [<i>la’am</i>] upon it,” and it is written there: “Abide you here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5). This verse in Genesis is traditionally interpreted to mean: <b>A people [<i>am</i>] that is similar to a donkey,</b> from which it may be inferred that even the members of this people merit a share in the world to come. |
| Genesis 22:5 | “You abide here with [ im ] the donkey” | Kiddushin 68a:13 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in betrothal <b>with him</b> or with others, the offspring is like her. This ruling refers specifically to a Canaanite maidservant or a gentile woman. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal with <b>a Canaanite maidservant</b> is ineffective? <b>Rav Huna says: The verse states</b> that Abraham commanded his slaves: <b>“You abide here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5), which alludes to the fact that his slaves belong to <b>a nation [<i>am</i>] similar to a donkey;</b> just as betrothal is ineffective with animals, it is likewise ineffective with Canaanite maidservants. The Gemara comments: <b>We have found that betrothal is ineffective with</b> a Canaanite maidservant; |
| Genesis 22:5 | For it is stated: “And Abraham said to his young men: Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go onward; and we will worship, and we will come back to you” | Moed Katan18a:4 | This is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a covenant is made with the lips,</b> and that one’s speech has the power to change events? <b>For it is stated: “And Abraham said to his young men: Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go onward; and we will worship, and we will come back to you”</b> (Genesis 22:5). Abraham said this even though he thought that he was going to sacrifice his son as an offering and that Isaac would not be returning, <b>yet this had an influence and they both came back.</b> |
| Genesis 22:5 | “Remain here with [ im ] the donkey” | Niddah 17a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And those</b> members of that household, who act in that manner, <b>what</b> verse <b>do they interpret</b> in a manner that allows them to do so? The Gemara answers: They reference the verse in which Abraham said to his two servants: <b>“Remain here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5). This verse is interpreted as meaning that they are <b>a nation [<i>am</i>] comparable to a donkey.</b> The members of the aforementioned household thought that it is permitted to engage in intercourse in the presence of animals, and therefore one can do so in the presence of his Canaanite slaves and maidservants. |
| Genesis 22:5 | “Remain here with the donkey” | Yevamot 62a:14 | <b>Rav said: Everyone agrees with regard to</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, that he does not have lineage, as it is written</b> that Abraham said to his slaves: <b>“Remain here with the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5). This verse is interpreted to mean that they are <b>a nation comparable to a donkey,</b> which has no lineage. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon a verse pertaining to Jonathan’s Canaanite slave: <b>“And Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants”</b> (II Samuel 9:10), which indicates that a slave’s sons are in fact considered his sons. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> This is <b>like</b> the expression: <b>A bullock, son of a bull.</b> The word son in this context merely denotes progeny, not lineage. |
| Genesis 22:8 | “God will provide [ yireh ] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering” | Berakhot 62b:15 | <b>Rav said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>the patriarch, Jacob,</b> about whom the term seeing is used: <b>“And Jacob said when he saw them [<i>ra’am</i>]:</b> This is God’s camp” (Genesis 32:3). <b>And Shmuel said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>Isaac’s ashes, as it is said</b> in the portion of the binding of Isaac: <b>“God will provide [<i>yireh</i>] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering”</b> (Genesis 22:8). |
| Genesis 22:10 | and took the knife to slaughter | Chullin 16a:5 | § <b>Rav sat behind Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> sat <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat and said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that slaughter is</b> performed specifically <b>with</b> a blade that is <b>detached?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Abraham stretched forth his hand <b>and took the knife to slaughter</b> his son” (Genesis 22:10). <b>Rav said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: What is he saying?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>He is saying</b> an incorrect reason, comparable to the letter <b><i>vav</i> that is written on</b> the rough surface of <b>a tree trunk [<i>a’ufta</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>say a verse</b> as proof for his statement? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse teaches us the diligence of Abraham,</b> who had a knife prepared to slaughter Isaac. It does not teach any <i>halakha</i> concerning ritual slaughter. |
| Genesis 22:10 | that which is written: “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son” | Menachot 82b:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the term utensil must be referring to <b>a knife,</b> as the slaughter may be performed only with a knife and not with a sharp stone or reed. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it must be slaughtered with a knife? This is learned from <b>that which is written: “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son”</b> (Genesis 22:10); <b>and there,</b> Abraham was sacrificing <b>a burnt offering, as it is written: “And offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son”</b> (Genesis 22:13). |
| Genesis 22:10 | that which is written: “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife | Zevachim 97b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> the term: Utensil, must be stated <b>of a knife,</b> as the slaughtering may be performed only with a knife and not with a sharp stone or reed. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering itself, from where do we</b> derive that it must be slaughtered with a knife? This is learned from <b>that which is written: “And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife</b> to slaughter his son” (Genesis 22:10); <b>and there,</b> Abraham was offering <b>a burnt offering, as it is written: “And offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son”</b> (Genesis 22:13). |
| Genesis 22:12 | is stated about Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it is written: “For now I know that you fear God” | Bava Batra15b:13 | <b>“And the Lord said to the Satan: Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on earth,</b> a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?” (Job 1:8). About this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That</b> which <b>is stated about Job is greater than that</b> which <b>is stated about Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it is written: “For now I know that you fear God”</b> (Genesis 22:12), <b>with regard to Job it is written: “A perfect and an upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil”</b> (Job 1:8). |
| Genesis 22:12 | greater than that which is stated with regard to Abraham. As with regard to Abraham | Sanhedrin 39b:12 | <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> The praise <b>that is stated with regard to Obadiah</b> is <b>greater than that which is stated with regard to Abraham. As with regard to Abraham</b> the verse states: “For now I know that you fear God” (Genesis 22:12), and the term <b>“greatly” is not written, and about Obadiah</b> the term <b>“greatly” is written.</b> |
| Genesis 22:12 | “God-fearing” | Sotah 31a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: It is stated with regard to Job</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is stated with regard to Abraham</b> that he was <b>“God-fearing”</b> (Genesis 22:12). <b>Just as</b> the description <b>“God-fearing,” which is stated with regard to Abraham,</b> is referring to Abraham’s fearing God <b>out of love, so too,</b> the description <b>“God-fearing” that is stated with regard to Job</b> indicates that Job feared God <b>out of love.</b> |

| Genesis 22:14 | mount, as it is stated: “As it is said on this day: On the mount where the Lord is seen” | Pesachim 88a:4 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse specifically mentions Jacob to allude to the fact that the Temple will ultimately be described in the same way that Jacob referred to it.

| Genesis 22:17 | it is written about all of Israel: “As the sand which is upon the seashore” | Bava Batra7b:14 | § It is related that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> once <b>imposed</b> payment of the tax for <b>the wall</b> even <b>on the Sages. Reish Lakish said to him: The Sages do not require protection, as it is written:</b> “How precious are your dear ones to me, O God…<b>If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand”</b> (Psalms 139:17–18). <b>If I should count whom? If we say</b> this is referring to <b>the righteous,</b> and the verse is saying <b>that they are greater in number than the</b> grains of <b>sand,</b> this is difficult. <b>Now</b> if <b>it is written about all of Israel: “As the sand which is upon the seashore”</b> (Genesis 22:17), can <b>the righteous themselves,</b> who are a part of Israel, <b>be greater in number than the</b> grains of <b>sand?</b> How can they possibly outnumber the grains of sand upon the seashore? |
| Genesis 23:2 | And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her” | Bava Kamma93a:3 | § In connection with the incident of Abraham and Abimelech mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Rabbi Ḥanan says: One who passes</b> the <b>judgment of another</b> to Heaven <b>is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you,</b> I gave my handmaid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: The Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. <b>And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only in a situation <b>where he has</b> someone to do <b>judgment</b> for him <b>on earth</b> and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court. |
| Genesis 23:2 | “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her” | Rosh Hashanah16b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins,</b> and <b>they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting next to <b>an inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse; <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of one’s status and merit; <b>and passing a case against another</b> to Heaven, <b>for Rabbi Avin said: Anyone who passes a case against another</b> to God <b>is punished first.</b> Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, <b>as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you;</b> I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let the Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), <b>and it is written</b> afterward: <b>“And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2). Sarah called upon Heaven to pass judgment between her and her husband, and therefore she was punished and died first. |
| Genesis 23:2 | “And Abraham came to eulogize Sarah and weep over her” | Sanhedrin 46b:21 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the verse that states: <b>“And Abraham came to eulogize Sarah and weep over her”</b> (Genesis 23:2), indicating that Sarah’s funeral was delayed until Abraham returned from Beersheba to Hebron to eulogize her. <b>And if you say</b> that a eulogy is delivered <b>due to the honor of the living, would they have</b> unduly <b>delayed</b> burying <b>Sarah due to Abraham’s honor?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It was satisfactory to Sarah herself</b> that her funeral was delayed <b>so that Abraham could be honored by</b> eulogizing <b>her.</b> Since Sarah herself would prefer that Abraham eulogize her, there was no disgrace in waiting for Abraham to arrive. |
| Genesis 23:3 | as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead” | Berakhot 18a:3 | <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, from</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b> This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him. To resolve this contradiction, <b>Rav Pappa said: Explain</b> the <i>baraita</i> as applicable only to the particular case when <b>one turns his face</b> away <b>and eats,</b> with the deceased laid out before him.

| Genesis 23:4 | it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me” | Berakhot 18a:3 | <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, from</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b> This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him.

| Genesis 23:13 | “I will give money for the field; take it from me” | Kiddushin 2a:4 | The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron.</b> How so? <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there,</b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money. |
| Genesis 23:13 | taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me” | Kiddushin 4b:3 | § The Gemara notes: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman can be betrothed with money <b>from here,</b> a different source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found</b> some unseemly matter <b>in her,</b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), in this verse, the term <b>taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). |
| Genesis 23:15 | “A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, | Bava Metzia87a:3 | <b>From where do we</b> derive this principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little? We derive it <b>from Ephron. Initially, it is written</b> that Ephron said to Abraham: <b>“A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver,</b> what is that between me and you?” (Genesis 23:15). And <b>ultimately it is written: “And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant”</b> (Genesis 23:16), i.e., shekels that could be used in any location. This teaches <b>that</b> not only did Ephron take shekels from Abraham, <b>he took from him only centenaria [<i>kantarei</i>],</b> i.e., superior coins, <b>as there is a place where they call a shekel a centenarius.</b> |
| Genesis 23:16 | ultimately it is written: “And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” | Bava Metzia87a:3 | <b>From where do we</b> derive this principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little?

| Genesis 23:16 | centenaria, as it is written: “Four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” | Bekhorot 50a:8 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the value of coins. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Any silver</b> shekel <b>that is stated in the Torah</b> but which is <b>unspecified</b> is referring to one <b><i>sela</i>.</b> Additionally, any unspecified silver shekel mentioned <b>in the Prophets</b> is a silver <b><i>litra</i>,</b> weighing twenty-five <i>sela</i>, and any unspecified silver shekel mentioned <b>in the Writings</b> is in <b>centenaria [<i>kintarin</i>],</b> silver weighing one hundred <i>sela</i>. This is the case throughout the Bible <b>except for the silver of Ephron, where even though it is written in the Torah:</b> “Shekels of silver,” <b>without specification,</b> it is in <b>centenaria, as it is written: “Four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant”</b> (Genesis 23:16). This means that the silver was acceptable as shekels everywhere, <b>and there is a place where they call a centenarius a shekel.</b> |
| Genesis 24:1 | and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything [ bakkol ]” | Bava Batra141a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> is this referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> the term <b>“with everything [<i>bakkol</i>],”</b> that is difficult. The Gemara cites Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything [<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The blessing was <b>that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The blessing was <b>that he had a daughter, and her name</b> was <b>Bakkol.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda understands the birth of a daughter to be a blessing. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> explain that the blessing was that <b>the Merciful One did not even deprive Abraham</b> of <b>a daughter,</b> in addition to his sons. <b>Did you hear him</b> say <b>that</b> a daughter is <b>preferable to a son?</b> |
| Genesis 24:1 | “And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything [ bakkol ]” | Bava Batra16b:10 | The Gemara comments that this disagreement is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The Torah states: <b>“And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything [<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1), and the Sages disagree about <b>what <i>bakkol</i></b> means. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The blessing is <b>that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> On the contrary, the blessing was <b>that he had a daughter. Others say: Abraham had a daughter and her name was Bakkol. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: Abraham our forefather was so knowledgeable in astrology [<i>itztagninut</i>] that all the kings of the East and the West would come early to his door</b> due to his wisdom. This is the blessing of <i>bakkol</i>, that he possessed knowledge that everybody needed. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: A precious stone hung around the neck of Abraham our forefather; any sick person who looked at it would immediately be healed. When Abraham our forefather died, the Holy One, Blessed be He, hung</b> this stone <b>from the sphere of the sun,</b> which from that point on brought healing to the sick. <b>Abaye said: This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: As the day progresses, sickness is lifted.</b> |
| Genesis 24:1 | with everything” | Bava Batra17a:1 | <b>a taste of the World-to-Come. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And the Lord blessed Abraham <b>with everything”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Isaac, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And I have eaten <b>from everything”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Jacob, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “Because I have <b>everything”</b> (Genesis 33:11). This teaches that already in their lifetimes they merited everything, i.e., perfection. |
| Genesis 24:1 | as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age” | Bava Metzia87a:14 | § The Gemara continues discussing Abraham: <b>Until Abraham, there was no aging,</b> i.e., old age was not physically recognizable. Consequently, <b>one who wanted to speak to Abraham</b> would mistakenly <b>speak to Isaac,</b> and vice versa: An individual who wanted to speak <b>to Isaac</b> would <b>speak to Abraham,</b> as they were indistinguishable. <b>Abraham came and prayed for mercy, and aging was</b> at last noticeable, <b>as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age”</b> (Genesis 24:1), which is the first time that aging is mentioned in the Bible. |
| Genesis 24:1 | and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things” | Kiddushin 82a:10 | The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result. |
| Genesis 24:1 | anyone who saw Isaac said: That is Abraham. Abraham prayed for mercy, that he would undergo aging, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age” | Sanhedrin 107b:17 | Apropos the death of Elisha, the Gemara says: <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Abraham there was no aging,</b> and the old and the young looked the same. <b>Anyone who saw Abraham said: That is Isaac,</b> and <b>anyone who saw Isaac said: That is Abraham. Abraham prayed for mercy, that he would undergo aging, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age”</b> (Genesis 24:1). There is no mention of aging before that verse. <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Jacob there was no weakness,</b> i.e., illness. Jacob <b>prayed for mercy and there was weakness, as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill”</b> (Genesis 48:1). <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Elisha, there was no ill person who recovered, and Elisha came and prayed for mercy and recovered, as it is stated: “And Elisha was fallen ill of his illness from which he was to die”</b> (II Kings 13:14). That is the first mention of a person who was ill and who did not die from that illness. |
| Genesis 24:1 | [ bakkol ]” | Sotah 5a:5 | He continues the interpretation: <b>But if he repents from</b> his arrogance, <b>he is gathered</b> in death <b>at his proper time like Abraham our forefather, as it is stated: “Yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all [<i>kakkol</i>] others”</b> (Job 24:24), indicating that when he repents from his arrogance he will die <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written about them</b> that they were blessed with the term “all,” as in the verse above. With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham <b>in all</b> things <b>[<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten <b>of all [<i>mikkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have <b>all [<i>khol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 33:11). <b>And if</b> one does <b>not</b> repent, then, the verse in Job continues: <b>“And wither like the tops of the husks.”</b> |
| Genesis 24:1 | an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” | Yoma 28b:7 | When <b>they were in Egypt</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when <b>they were in the desert,</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16). <b>Abraham our Patriarch</b> was himself <b>an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years”</b> (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <b>Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old</b> and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, <b>Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age”</b> (Genesis 48:10). |
| Genesis 24:2 | Eliezer, servant of Abraham, was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all he had” | Yoma 28b:8 | <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham, was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all he had”</b> (Genesis 24:2). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The verse means that <b>he had mastery over the Torah of his master,</b> having gained proficiency in all of the Torah of Abraham. That is the meaning of the verse: <b>“He is Damascus [<i>Dammesek</i>] Eliezer”</b> (Genesis 15:2). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The word <i>Dammesek</i> is a contraction of he <b>who draws [<i>doleh</i>] and gives drink [<i>mashke</i>] to others from his master’s Torah.</b> |
| Genesis 24:3 | “And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven” | Shevuot 38b:20 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>How</b> does the court <b>administer an oath to</b> someone who is liable to take an oath? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>administers to him the oath stated in the Torah, as it is written</b> in Abraham’s instruction to his servant: <b>“And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven”</b> (Genesis 24:3). |
| Genesis 24:8 | “If the woman is not willing | Kiddushin 61b:12 | The Gemara inquires about another verse in that chapter: <b>“If the woman is not willing</b> to follow you” (Genesis 24:8). <b>Why do I</b> need this clause? The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary,</b> since it might <b>enter your mind to say: If it is satisfactory for them but not satisfactory for her,</b> he <b>should bring</b> her <b>against her wishes.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that he should not bring her against her wishes. |
| Genesis 24:14 | as it is written: “That the maiden to whom I shall say: Please let down your pitcher | Taanit 4a:5 | The Gemara clarifies each of these cases in turn: With regard to <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham,</b> he made a request when he prayed beside the well, <b>as it is written: “That the maiden to whom I shall say: Please let down your pitcher</b> that I may drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; that she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac” (Genesis 24:14). Eliezer entreated God unreasonably, as his request allowed for the possibility that she <b>might even</b> be <b>lame</b> or <b>even blind,</b> and yet he had promised to take her to Isaac. Nevertheless, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>reasonably and</b> the eminently suitable <b>Rebecca happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b> |
| Genesis 24:15 | “With her pitcher [ vekhadah ] upon her shoulder [ shikhmah ]” | Avodah Zarah29a:5 | This remedy is beneficial for several ailments, and the Gemara presents each of these in turn: <b>For</b> curing the <b>heart,</b> the above combination should be taken <b>with wine, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). <b>For</b> curing an ailment that arises due to <b>the wind [<i>ruḥa</i>],</b> one drinks the mixture <b>in water, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And the spirit [<i>ruaḥ</i>] of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>For childbirth [<i>lekhuda</i>],</b> a woman in labor drinks the mixture <b>with beer [<i>shikhra</i>], and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“With her pitcher [<i>vekhadah</i>] upon her shoulder [<i>shikhmah</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:15). |
| Genesis 24:16 | similarly states: “And the maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin, | Yevamot 61b:13 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The High Priest must marry <b>a virgin, and</b> the term <b>virgin</b> refers <b>only</b> to <b>a maiden. And</b> a verse <b>similarly states: “And the maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin,</b> and no man had known her” (Genesis 24:16). |
| Genesis 24:17 | please, a little water from your jug” | Shabbat 77a:6 | We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>milk</b> is <b>equivalent to</b> that which is <b>swallowed [<i>kedei gemia</i>]</b> in one gulp. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the correct version of the mishna: <b><i>Kedei gemia</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> <b>or <i>kedei gemia</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It should be written with an <i>alef</i> as we find in the Torah: “And he said: <b>Give me to swallow [<i>hagmi’ini</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> ] <b>please, a little water from your jug”</b> (Genesis 24:17). |
| Genesis 24:34 | “And he said: I am Abraham’s servant” | Bava Kamma92b:6 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If you are aware of <b>a derogatory matter that is</b> found <b>in you, say it first</b> before others say it about you? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Eliezer: <b>“And he said: I am Abraham’s servant”</b> (Genesis 24:34), immediately proclaiming that he is a servant. |
| Genesis 24:38 | necessary | Kiddushin 61b:11 | The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary</b> for this to be stated; if Abraham had stated only: “And take a wife for my son” (Genesis 24:38), it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the arrangement <b>is satisfactory for her, but not satisfactory for</b> her family, he <b>should bring</b> her <b>against their wishes.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that Eliezer is not obligated to bring her against her family’s wishes. |
| Genesis 24:41 | “Then you shall be clear from my oath | Kiddushin 61b:10 | The Gemara asks another question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written,</b> with regard to Abraham’s instruction to Eliezer to bring a wife for Isaac: <b>“Then you shall be clear from my oath</b>…if they will not give her to you” (Genesis 24:41). <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need this addition? The positive formulation of the oath already indicates the negative. |
| Genesis 24:42 | as it is written: “And I came that day to the well” | Sanhedrin 95a:16 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to land contracting to shorten a journey: <b>For three</b> individuals <b>the land contracted,</b> and each one miraculously reached his destination quickly: <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham, and Jacob our forefather, and Abishai, son of Zeruiah.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The case of <b>Abishai, son of Zeruiah,</b> is <b>that which we said.</b> The case of <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham,</b> is <b>as it is written: “And I came that day to the well”</b> (Genesis 24:42). His intention was <b>to say</b> to the members of Rebecca’s family <b>that on that day he left</b> Canaan and on the same day he arrived, to underscore the miraculous nature of his undertaking on behalf of Abraham. The case of <b>Jacob our forefather</b> |
| Genesis 24:50 | from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord, | Moed Katan18b:15 | <b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili as follows: From the Torah, and from the Prophets, and from the Writings;</b> it implies that the decree that a specific <b>woman</b> is destined to be married <b>to</b> a specific <b>man</b> is <b>from God.</b> From where is this derived? It is <b>from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord,</b> we cannot speak to you either bad or good” (Genesis 24:50). <b>From the Prophets, as it is written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord”</b> (Judges 14:4). <b>From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 19:14). |
| Genesis 24:55 | “And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten” | Ketubot 57b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that a virgin is given twelve months to prepare for her wedding? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> it is based on the fact <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to Rebecca: <b>“And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten”</b> (Genesis 24:55). |
| Genesis 24:55 | “And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten” | Ketubot 57b:3 | The Gemara first analyzes the language of the verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”? If we say two days,</b> the minimum number justifying the use of the plural, does <b>a person</b> really <b>speak like this?</b> Rebecca’s relatives <b>said to</b> Abraham’s servant that they wanted her to stay for <b>two days,</b> after which <b>he said to them no,</b> as he did not want to wait even that long. If so, is it possible that after that <b>they said to him</b> that they wanted her to stay for <b>ten days?</b> Consequently, it is impossible to explain the word “days” as two days and “ten” as ten days. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”?</b> It means: <b>A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:29), and there it is explained that “days” is referring to a year. Consequently, in the verse <b>“And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten”</b> (Genesis 24:55), “days” refers to a year, and “ten” refers to a shorter period of similar magnitude, i.e. ten months, in order to prepare for her wedding. |
| Genesis 24:55 | “then [ aḥar ] she will go” | Nedarim 37b:8 | <b>The ornamentation of the scribes</b> are expressions that the scribes understood in a manner that differs slightly from its plain understanding. For example: <b>“Then [<i>aḥar</i>] go on”</b> (Genesis 18:5); <b>“then [<i>aḥar</i>] she will go”</b> (Genesis 24:55); <b>“afterward [<i>aḥar</i>] you will be gathered”</b> (Numbers 31:2); <b>“the singers go before, the minstrels follow after [<i>aḥar</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:26); <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains”</b> (Psalms 36:7). |
| Genesis 24:61 | in school, as it is stated: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man” | Berakhot 61a:24 | <b>Rav Ashi said: And according to what Rav Naḥman said,</b> that <b>Manoah was an ignoramus; he did not even</b> learn to <b>read</b> the basic Torah stories that even children learn <b>in school, as it is stated: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man”</b> (Genesis 24:61); they followed him and did <b>not</b> walk <b>before the man.</b> |
| Genesis 24:61 | in school. As it is written: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man” | Eruvin 18b:8 | <b>Rav Ashi said: And according to what Rav Naḥman said,</b> that <b>Manoah was an ignoramus, he did not even read</b> the basic Torah stories that children learn <b>in school. As it is written: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man”</b> (Genesis 24:61); they followed him and did <b>not</b> walk <b>before the man.</b> |
| Genesis 24:61 | But isn’t it written: “And Rebecca and her damsels arose and they rode upon camels” | Pesachim 3a:14 | With regard to the above <i>baraita</i> taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael, the Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a woman, is</b> the term <b>riding not written</b> in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Rebecca and her damsels arose and they rode upon camels”</b> (Genesis 24:61)? The Gemara answers: <b>There, due to fear of camels, that is standard conduct.</b> Since a camel’s back is high off the ground, a woman cannot sit on it sidesaddle; consequently, she may ride on it without being considered immodest. The Gemara cites another relevant verse. <b>But isn’t it written: “And Moses took his wife and his children and rode them upon his donkey”</b> (Exodus 4:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> despite the fact that his wife was also on the donkey, the verse employs the language of riding |
| Genesis 24:63 | nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate [ lasuaḥ ] in the field” | Avodah Zarah7b:14 | Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi elaborates: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person should request his own needs</b> first <b>and afterward recite</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted, when he is faint and pours out <i>siḥo</i> before the Lord.</b> O Lord, hear my prayer” (Psalms 102:1–2). These verses indicate that one first requests help concerning his afflictions and pains, and only afterward pours forth his <i>siḥa</i>. And <b><i>siḥa</i></b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field”</b> (Genesis 24:63). |
| Genesis 24:63 | Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [ lasuaḥ ] in the field toward evening” | Berakhot 26b:6 | <b>Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field toward evening”</b> (Genesis 24:63), <b>and conversation</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [<i>siḥo</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Psalms 102:1). Obviously, Isaac was the first to pray as evening approached, at the time of the afternoon prayer. |
| Genesis 24:63 | as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate in the field” | Pesachim 88a:4 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse specifically mentions Jacob to allude to the fact that the Temple will ultimately be described in the same way that Jacob referred to it.

It is written of him</b> that when he prayed at the location of the Temple mountain, he called it <b>mount, as it is stated: “As it is said on this day: On the mount where the Lord is seen”</b> (Genesis 22:14). <b>And</b> it will <b>not</b> be referred to <b>as</b> it was referred to by <b>Isaac. It is written of him</b> that he called the location of the Temple <b>field</b> when he prayed there, <b>as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate in the field”</b> (Genesis 24:63). <b>Rather,</b> it will be described <b>as</b> it was referred to by <b>Jacob, who called it house, as it is stated: “And he called the name of that place Beth-El”</b> (Genesis 28:19), which means house of God. |
| Genesis 24:67 | “And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted for his mother” | Bava Kamma92b:9 | Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah.

| Genesis 25:1 | It is written: “Keturah” | Zevachim 62b:1 | <b>“The children of Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:4). Although Keturah’s children were children of Abraham, they were not of the same caliber as Isaac. Similarly, Rav Yosef was saying that his other students were not of the caliber of Abaye. Having mentioned this term, the Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Tarfon’s sister were sitting</b> silently <b>before Rabbi Tarfon.</b> In an attempt to encourage them to say something, <b>he began and said:</b> The verse states: <b>And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Yoḥani. They said to</b> Rabbi Tarfon: <b>It is written: “Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:1), not Yoḥani. Rabbi Tarfon <b>read,</b> i.e., said, <b>about them</b> the phrase <b>“the children of Keturah”</b> as they were able to contribute only this small piece of information. |

| Genesis 25:9 | said to them: Children [ dardekei ], this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Ishmael repented in the lifetime of his father, as it is stated: “And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him” | Bava Batra16b:16 | Ravina asked: <b>But isn’t there Ishmael, about whom <i>gevia</i> and <i>asifa</i> are written,</b> as it is stated: “And these are the years of the life of Yishmael…and he expired and died [<i>vayyigva vayyamot</i>]; and was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17)? <b>Meanwhile Rava,</b> who had heard the discussion in his dozed state, fully <b>awoke</b> and <b>said to them: Children [<i>dardekei</i>], this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Ishmael repented in the lifetime of his father, as it is stated: “And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him”</b> (Genesis 25:9).

| Genesis 25:10 | “The field which Abraham acquired” | Kiddushin 2a:5 | The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the <b>taking</b> of Ephron’s field <b>is called an acquisition</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“The field which Abraham acquired”</b> (Genesis 25:10). |

| Genesis 25:19 | and it is written: “And these are the generations of Isaac, son of Abraham” | Sanhedrin 91a:14 | The Gemara relates: <b>And</b> on <b>another occasion, the descendants of Ishmael and the descendants of Keturah came to judgment with the Jewish people before Alexander of Macedon.

| Genesis 25:20 | as it is written: “And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah | Yevamot 64a:6 | <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Let us derive from Isaac</b> that one may wait a longer period of time, <b>as it is written: “And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah</b>…to be his wife” (Genesis 25:20), <b>and it is written</b> with regard to the birth of Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). This indicates that one may wait twenty years. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Isaac</b> knew that he <b>was infertile,</b> and therefore there was no reason for him to marry another woman, as Rebekah was not the cause of their infertility. |
| Genesis 25:21 | Rabbi Elazar said: Why are the prayers of the righteous likened to a pitchfork [ eter ]? | Sukkah 14a:9 | Apropos a pitchfork, the Gemara cites a related aggadic teaching: <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Why are the prayers of the righteous likened to a pitchfork [<i>eter</i>]?</b> It is written: “And Isaac entreated [<i>vayetar</i>] the Lord for his wife, because she was barren” (Genesis 25:21), <b>to say to you: Just as this pitchfork overturns the grain on the threshing floor from place to place, so too, the prayers of the righteous overturn the mind of the Holy One, Blessed be He, from the attribute of cruelty to the attribute of mercy,</b> and He accepts their prayers. |
| Genesis 25:21 | Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Isaac our father was infertile, as it is stated: “And Isaac entreated the Lord concerning [ lenokhaḥ ] his wife | Yevamot 64a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Isaac our father was infertile, as it is stated: “And Isaac entreated the Lord concerning [<i>lenokhaḥ</i>] his wife</b> because she was barren” (Genesis 25:21). <b>It is not stated</b> that he entreated the Lord <b>for [<i>al</i>] his wife, but <i>lenokhaḥ</i>,</b> which can mean opposite, against, or corresponding to; this <b>teaches that they were both infertile.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the verse continue: <b>“And</b> the Lord <b>let Himself be entreated of him”?</b> The verse <b>should say: And</b> the Lord <b>let Himself be entreated of them.</b> The Gemara answers that their prayers were answered due to Isaac, <b>because the prayer of a righteous individual</b> who is <b>the son of a righteous individual is not similar to the prayer of a righteous individual</b> who is <b>the son of a wicked individual,</b> and Rebekah’s father was the wicked Bethuel. |
| Genesis 25:23 | “the Lord said to her: Two nations [ goyim ] are in your womb” | Avodah Zarah11a:6 | § The Gemara returns to its discussion of Antoninus: When the matriarch Rebecca was pregnant with Jacob and Esau, <b>“the Lord said to her: Two nations [<i>goyim</i>] are in your womb”</b> (Genesis 25:23). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Do not read</b> it as <b><i>goyim</i>,</b> meaning nations; <b>rather</b> read it as <b><i>geyim</i>,</b> meaning proud ones. <b>This</b> verse was fulfilled in two prominent individuals who descended from Rebecca, <b>Antoninus and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>whose tables,</b> due to their wealth, <b>never lacked for lettuce, nor cucumbers, nor radish, neither in the summer nor in the rainy season,</b> despite the fact that these foods do not grow year round. The reason they ensured that these items were always present at their tables is <b>that the Master said: A radish breaks up food, lettuce stirs up food,</b> and <b>cucumbers expand the intestines.</b> |
| Genesis 25:23 | nothing other than kingdom, as it is stated: “And the one kingdom [ ule’om ] shall be stronger than the other kingdom [ mile’om ]” | Avodah Zarah2b:1 | <b>with their scholars, as it is stated: “And let the peoples [<i>le’umim</i>] be assembled”</b> (Isaiah 43:9); <b>and</b> the term <b><i>le’om</i></b> means <b>nothing other than kingdom, as it is stated: “And the one kingdom [<i>ule’om</i>] shall be stronger than the other kingdom [<i>mile’om</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:23). The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> it possible for <b>there</b> to be <b>intermingling before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that it should be necessary for each nation to stand and be addressed separately? <b>Rather,</b> the nations are instructed to stand separately <b>so that they will not become intermingled with each other</b> in order <b>that they will</b> each <b>hear what He says to them.</b> |
| Genesis 25:23 | Is that really so? Is it not written: “And the Lord said unto her: Two nations [ goyim ] are in your womb” | Berakhot 57b:17 | It was <b>taught</b> in the <b>school of Rabbi Yishmael: Why are they called cucumbers [<i>kishu’im</i>]? Because they are as harmful [<i>kashim</i>] to the body as swords.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that really so? Is it not written: “And the Lord said unto her: Two nations [<i>goyim</i>] are in your womb”</b> (Genesis 25:23) and the Gemara says: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>goyim</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>gayim</i>, proud ones.

| Genesis 25:23 | “And the one people shall be stronger than the other people” | Megillah 6a:17 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The same idea may be derived <b>from here,</b> a verse dealing with Jacob and Esau: <b>“And the one people shall be stronger than the other people”</b> (Genesis 25:23), teaching that when one nation rises, the other necessarily falls. |
| Genesis 25:23 | “The one people shall be stronger than the other people” | Pesachim 42b:6 | <b>And now,</b> after the destruction of the Temple, <b>Edomite wine does not turn to vinegar unless one places barley into it. This is called Edomite vinegar, to fulfill that which is stated</b> with regard to Tyre, and the same applies to other enemies of the Jewish people: “Because Tyre has said against Jerusalem: Aha, she is broken that was the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; <b>I shall be filled with her that is laid waste”</b> (Ezekiel 26:2). The Sages expound: <b>If this one,</b> Jerusalem, <b>is full,</b> then <b>that one,</b> her enemy, <b>is laid waste; and if this</b> enemy <b>is full,</b> then <b>she,</b> Jerusalem, <b>is laid waste.</b> Therefore, when the Jewish people fall, their enemies can achieve the success that was once attained by the Jews. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This notion can be derived <b>from here,</b> where the verse states regarding Esau and Jacob: <b>“The one people shall be stronger than the other people”</b> (Genesis 25:23), meaning that when one nation gains power, the other is weakened, because they cannot both be strong at the same time. |
| Genesis 25:23 | and the one leom shall overcome the other leom ” | Sanhedrin 92a:1 | <b>the people [<i>leom</i>] shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>],</b> but blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides” (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And</b> the term <b><i>leom</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than fetuses, as it is stated:</b> “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your bowels; <b>and the one <i>leom</i> shall overcome the other <i>leom</i>”</b> (Genesis 25:23). <b>And <i>kabbo</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than curse, as it is stated</b> in the statement of Balaam: <b>“How can I curse one who is not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>] by God?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>bar</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Pay homage to <i>bar</i> lest He be angry”</b> (Psalms 2:12), i.e., observe the Torah to avoid God’s wrath. |
| Genesis 25:23 | “And one people [ le’om ] shall be stronger than the other people [ le’om ]” | Sotah 41b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him, even fetuses in their mothers’ wombs curse him, as it is stated: “He who says to the wicked: You are righteous, peoples shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>], nations [<i>leummim</i>] shall execrate him”</b> (Proverbs 24:24); <b>and <i>kov</i>,</b> the linguistic root of the word <i>yikkevuhu</i>, means <b>only a curse, as it is stated:</b> Balaam explained that he did not curse the Jewish people, as he said: “How can I curse [<i>ekkov</i>] <b>whom God has not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>]?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>le’om</i></b> is homiletically interpreted to mean <b>only fetuses, as it is stated</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau, when they were still in Rebecca’s womb: <b>“And one people [<i>le’om</i>] shall be stronger than the other people [<i>le’om</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:23). |
| Genesis 25:24 | “And her time to give birth was fulfilled [ vayimle’u ] and there were twins in her belly” | Berakhot 5b:24 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Moreover, his wife will not miscarry.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here: “And whose belly You fill [<i>temaleh</i>] with Your treasure,” and it is written there,</b> concerning Rebecca’s pregnancy: <b>“And her time to give birth was fulfilled [<i>vayimle’u</i>] and there were twins in her belly”</b> (Genesis 25:24), consequently: You fill with Your treasure refers to a pregnancy that proceeds without complication. |
| Genesis 25:25 | To eradicate the descendants of Esau, as it is written: “And the first [ harishon ] came forth red, all over like a hairy mantle; | Pesachim 5a:15 | The <i>tanna</i> provides the sources for his statement. <b>To eradicate the descendants of Esau, as it is written: “And the first [<i>harishon</i>] came forth red, all over like a hairy mantle;</b> and they called his name Esau” (Genesis 25:25). <b>And to the construction of the Temple, as it is written:</b> “The <b>Throne of Glory, on High from the beginning [<i>merishon</i>], the place of our Temple”</b> (Jeremiah 17:12). <b>And</b> the Jewish people were also entitled <b>to the name of Messiah, as it is written: “A harbinger [<i>rishon</i>] to Zion</b> I will give: <b>Behold, behold them;</b> and to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings” (Isaiah 41:27). However, <i>harishon</i> stated with regard to Passover is referring to the day before the Festival. |
| Genesis 25:26 | “And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them” | Megillah 17a:1 | <b>Why were the years of Ishmael mentioned</b> in the Torah? For what purpose were we told the life span of that wicked man? <b>In order to reckon through them the years of Jacob. As it is written: “And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years”</b> (Genesis 25:17). <b>How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram”</b> (Genesis 16:16). <b>And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him”</b> (Genesis 21:5). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). Based on these verses, <b>how old was Ishmael when Jacob was born? Seventy-four.

| Genesis 25:26 | “And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them” | Yevamot 64a:6 | <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Let us derive from Isaac</b> that one may wait a longer period of time, <b>as it is written: “And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah</b>…to be his wife” (Genesis 25:20), <b>and it is written</b> with regard to the birth of Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26).

Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Isaac</b> knew that he <b>was infertile,</b> and therefore there was no reason for him to marry another woman, as Rebekah was not the cause of their infertility. |
| Genesis 25:27 | “a quiet man, dwelling in tents” | Bava Batra123a:16 | Rav continues: <b>And she would sit at the crossroads and ask: What</b> are <b>the deeds of</b> the <b>older</b> son? The passersby would answer: <b>He is an evil man,</b> and he <b>robs people.</b> She would ask: <b>What</b> are <b>the deeds of</b> the <b>younger</b> son? They would answer: He is <b>“a quiet man, dwelling in tents”</b> (Genesis 25:27). <b>And</b> because she was so distraught at the prospect of marrying the evil brother, <b>she would cry</b> and pray for mercy <b>until her eyelashes fell out.</b> Since the weakness of her eyes was due to this cause, characterizing her eyes as weak constitutes praise. This is Leah’s prayer for mercy to which Rabbi Yonatan referred. |

As it is written:</b> “And Jacob was cooking a stew <b>and Esau came in from the field and he was faint”</b> (Genesis 25:29), <b>and</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: On that day Abraham our forefather passed away, and Jacob our forefather prepared a lentil stew to comfort Isaac, his father,</b> as it was customary to serve mourners lentil stew. |
| Genesis 25:29 | “And Jacob cooked [ vayyazed ] pottage” | Sanhedrin 69a:4 | A Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“But if a man comes intentionally [<i>yazid</i>]</b> against his neighbor, to slay him with guile, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die” (Exodus 21:14). The use of the term <i>yazid</i> in this context and its juxtaposition to the word “man” teaches that <b>a man can heat [<i>mezid</i>]</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm, but a minor cannot heat</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm.</b> Therefore, even though a minor can engage in full intercourse with a woman, he cannot father a child. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mezid</i> is a term</b> meaning <b>heating</b> up? <b>As it is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“And Jacob cooked [<i>vayyazed</i>] pottage”</b> (Genesis 25:29). |
| Genesis 25:29 | As it is written: “And Jacob simmered a pot [ vayyazed Ya’akov nazid ]” | Sotah 11a:11 | <b>Alternatively,</b> there is an additional way to punish the Egyptians with water: <b>He does not bring</b> a flood upon them, <b>but they</b> may <b>come and fall into</b> water, <b>and so it says:</b> “And the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; <b>and the Egyptians fled toward it;</b> and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27), indicating that the Egyptians fell into the water. <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar says: What is the</b> meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, <b>for in that which they conspired [<i>zadu</i>] against them”</b> (Exodus 18:11)? The phrase means: <b>In the pot in which they cooked, they</b> themselves <b>were cooked,</b> as they were punished through drowning, measure for measure, for drowning the Jewish babies. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“<i>zadu</i>” is a term</b> meaning <b>a pot?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob simmered a pot [<i>vayyazed Ya’akov nazid</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:29). |

| Genesis 25:33 | as it is written: “And he sold his birthright to Jacob” | Berakhot 7b:6 | Tangential to the mention of Leah’s son, Judah, and the reason for his name, the Gemara explains the sources for other names, including <b>Reuben. Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Reuben’s name should be considered a prophecy by Leah, as <b>Leah said: See [<i>re’u</i>] the difference between my son [<i>beni</i>] and the son of my father-in-law,</b> Esau, son of Isaac. <b>Even though</b> Esau <b>knowingly sold his birthright</b> to his brother Jacob, <b>as it is written: “And he sold his birthright to Jacob”</b> (Genesis 25:33), nonetheless, <b>behold what is written</b> about <b>him: “And Esau hated Jacob”</b> (Genesis 27:41). |

The reward for delighting in Shabbat is specifically the portion of Jacob. <b>Not that of Abraham, about whom it is written, “Rise, walk through the land through its length</b> and its width because I have given it to you” (Genesis 13:17), i.e., only this land alone in its borders. <b>And not that of Isaac, about whom it is written,</b> “Dwell in this land and I will be with you and I will bless you <b>because I will give all of these lands to you and your offspring”</b> (Genesis 26:3), meaning these lands and no others. <b>Rather, that of Jacob, about whom it is written,</b> “And your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, <b>and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south,</b> and all of the families of the land will be blessed through you and your offspring” (Genesis 28:14). There are no boundaries for Jacob’s portion. |
| Genesis 26:5 | We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws” | Kiddushin 82a:10 | The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result. |
| Genesis 26:5 | And Rabbi Ami bar Abba said: Abraham recognized his Creator at the age of three years, as it is stated: “Because [ ekev ] Abraham hearkened to My voice” | Nedarim 32a:18 | <b>And Rabbi Ami bar Abba said: Abraham recognized his Creator at the age of three years, as it is stated: “Because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham hearkened to My voice”</b> (Genesis 26:5). <b>The numerical value</b> of the letters of the word <i>ekev</i> is <b>172,</b> indicating that he observed the <i>halakha</i> for this many years. If Abraham lived until 175 then his first recognition of the Creator must have been at the age of three. |
| Genesis 26:5 | as it is stated: “Because [ ekev ] Abraham hearkened to My voice and kept | Yoma 28b:9 | Apropos the previous statement, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav said: Abraham our Patriarch fulfilled the entire Torah</b> before it was given, <b>as it is stated: “Because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham hearkened to My voice and kept</b> My charge, My mitzvot, My statutes and My Torahs” (Genesis 26:5). <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said to Rav: And say</b> that the verse means that he fulfilled only the <b>seven</b> Noahide <b>mitzvot</b> and not the entire Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there also circumcision</b> that Abraham clearly observed, which is not one of the Noahide laws? Apparently, Abraham fulfilled more than just those seven. The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that he fulfilled only <b>the seven mitzvot and circumcision.</b> Rav <b>said to him: If so, why do I</b> need the continuation of the verse, that Abraham kept: <b>My mitzvot and My Torah?</b> That is a clear indication that he fulfilled mitzvot beyond the seven Noahide mitzvot, and apparently fulfilled the entire Torah. |
| Genesis 26:12 | when it was blessed, it is written: “And Isaac sowed in that land, | Ketubot 112a:10 | <b>And this applies</b> only <b>to</b> a year when Eretz Yisrael is <b>not blessed. However,</b> with regard to a year <b>when it was blessed, it is written: “And Isaac sowed in that land,</b> and found in the same year a hundredfold” (Genesis 26:12). Isaac’s field produced one hundred times the normal yield, which according to the above calculations is fifty thousand <i>kor</i>, as stated in the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Genesis 26:19 | Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water” | Berakhot 56b:7 | The Gemara continues dealing with interpretations of the details of dreams: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water”</b> (Genesis 26:19), and ultimately there was peace. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who sees a well in his dream it is a symbol that <b>he has found Torah,</b> as the well symbolizes Torah. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“For whoever finds me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35), <b>and it is written here: “A well of living water,”</b> and we see that a well is linked to Torah as both are associated with life. <b>Rava said:</b> The well in the dream symbolizes <b>actual life.</b> |
| Genesis 26:20 | until they started a quarrel, as it is stated: “And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen saying: The water is ours” | Sanhedrin 111a:9 | <b>I said to Isaac: “Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you”</b> (Genesis 26:3). <b>His servants sought water to drink and they did not find</b> it <b>until they started a quarrel, as it is stated: “And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen saying: The water is ours”</b> (Genesis 26:20), <b>and he did not question My attributes.</b> |
| Genesis 27:1 | was fulfilled in her descendant, as it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see” | Bava Kamma93a:5 | The Gemara provides another lesson from the story of Abraham and Abimelech. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The curse of an ordinary person should never be</b> regarded as <b>light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah and it was fulfilled in her descendant.</b> The curse on Sarah is <b>as it is stated: “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes”</b> (Genesis 20:16), meaning that <b>he said to her: Since you concealed</b> your status <b>from me and you did not reveal that</b> Abraham <b>is your husband, and you caused me this suffering, may it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should have children with covered eyes. And</b> this curse <b>was fulfilled in her descendant, as it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see”</b> (Genesis 27:1). |
| Genesis 27:1 | “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, | Megillah 15a:18 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One should not regard the curse of an ordinary person as light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah,</b> saying: <b>“Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes</b> to all that are with you” (Genesis 20:16), <b>and</b> indeed <b>this was fulfilled in her descendant,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,</b> so that he could not see” (Genesis 27:1). Abimelech’s curse of covered eyes was fulfilled through her son Isaac’s blindness. |
| Genesis 27:1 | his eyes become dim, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see” | Megillah 28a:16 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> One who gazes at the likeness of an evil man, <b>his eyes become dim, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see”</b> (Genesis 27:1). This happened <b>because he gazed at the wicked Esau.</b> |
| Genesis 27:1 | Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old | Yoma 28b:7 | When <b>they were in Egypt</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when <b>they were in the desert,</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16). <b>Abraham our Patriarch</b> was himself <b>an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years”</b> (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <b>Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old</b> and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, <b>Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age”</b> (Genesis 48:10). |
| Genesis 27:12 | as it is written: “Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be in his eyes like a fraud” | Makkot 24a:7 | <b>“Who has no slander upon his tongue”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>our forefather Jacob,</b> who did not want to mislead his father in order to receive his blessings, <b>as it is written: “Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be in his eyes like a fraud”</b> (Genesis 27:12). |
| Genesis 27:12 | “And I shall seem to him a deceiver [ metate’a ]” | Sanhedrin 92a:19 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who amends</b> the truth <b>in his speech, it is as though he worships idols.</b> As, <b>it is written here,</b> in the verse where Jacob sought to resist taking his father’s blessing from Esau: <b>“And I shall seem to him a deceiver [<i>metate’a</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:12), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“They are vanity, the work of deception [<i>tatuim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 10:15). |
| Genesis 27:16 | another verse is written: “And the skins of the kids of the goats” | Chullin 113b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive from</b> that verse that in general, every instance of the word “kid” is referring to a goat, including the prohibition of meat cooked in milk? The Gemara answers: This cannot be, as <b>another verse is written: “And the skins of the kids of the goats”</b> (Genesis 27:16). This indicates that only <b>here</b> they are <b>kids of the goats, but anywhere</b> the word <b>“kid” is stated without specification, it means even a cow or a ewe.</b> |
| Genesis 27:22 | “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau” | Gittin 57b:9 | § Apropos its discussion of the destruction of the Temple and the calamities that befell Israel, the Gemara cites the verse: <b>“The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau”</b> (Genesis 27:22), which the Sages expounded as follows: <b>“The voice”; this</b> is the cry stirred up by <b>the emperor Hadrian, who</b> caused the Jewish people to cry out when he <b>killed six hundred thousand on six hundred thousand in Alexandria of Egypt, twice</b> the number of men <b>who left Egypt. “The voice of Jacob”; this is</b> the cry aroused by <b>the emperor Vespasian, who killed four million</b> people <b>in the city of Beitar. And some say:</b> He killed <b>forty million</b> people. <b>“And the hands are the hands of Esau”; this is the wicked kingdom</b> of Rome <b>that destroyed our Temple, burned our Sanctuary, and exiled us from our land.</b> |
| Genesis 27:27 | “And he smelled the smell of his garments, | Sanhedrin 37a:7 | <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that the source to rely on them not to transgress is <b>from here: “Your temples [<i>rakkatekh</i>] are like a pomegranate split open”</b> (Song of Songs 6:7), which teaches that <b>even the empty</b> people <b>[<i>reikanin</i>] among you are</b> as <b>full of mitzvot as the pomegranate</b> is full of seeds. <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that the source is <b>from here:</b> The verse states concerning the occasion when Isaac blessed Jacob: <b>“And he smelled the smell of his garments,</b> and blessed him, and said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed” (Genesis 27:27). <b>Do not read “his garments [<i>begadav</i>]”; rather,</b> read: <b>His traitors [<i>bogedav</i>],</b> meaning that even traitors and sinners among the Jewish people have qualities “as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.” |
| Genesis 27:27 | “And he said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed” | Taanit 29b:2 | The Gemara mentions a couple of other statements in the name of the same Sages mentioned above. First, it cites a verse that is referring to the Babylonian exile. <b>“To give to you a future and a hope”</b> (Jeremiah 29:11). <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: These are palm trees and garments of linen,</b> which are long-lasting and bring benefit as long as they exist. With regard to Isaac’s comment about Jacob: <b>“And he said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed”</b> (Genesis 27:27), <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav:</b> This <b>smell</b> was like that <b>of a field of apple trees.</b> |
| Genesis 27:30 | and it is written there: “From the presence of [ penei ] Isaac his father” | Sukkah 5b:1 | <b>of</b> a bird called <b><i>bar Yokhani</i>,</b> whose face is significantly larger than a handbreadth? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say that it is like the face of a bird, which is extremely small? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Rav Huna derives</b> that the thickness of the Ark cover was one handbreadth not through an actual comparison to the real faces of different creatures but rather by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b><i>penei</i></b> and <b><i>penei</i></b> written in different places in the Torah. <b>It is written here: “Before [<i>penei</i>] the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2), <b>and it is written there: “From the presence of [<i>penei</i>] Isaac his father”</b> (Genesis 27:30). The dimension of the Ark cover is like that of the face of a person, a handbreadth. |
| Genesis 27:33 | “Who then [ eifo ] is he that has taken venison” | Bava Batra15a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16). |
| Genesis 27:33 | from everything” | Bava Batra17a:1 | <b>a taste of the World-to-Come. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And the Lord blessed Abraham <b>with everything”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Isaac, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And I have eaten <b>from everything”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Jacob, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “Because I have <b>everything”</b> (Genesis 33:11). This teaches that already in their lifetimes they merited everything, i.e., perfection. |
| Genesis 27:33 | of all [ mikkol ]” | Sotah 5a:5 | He continues the interpretation: <b>But if he repents from</b> his arrogance, <b>he is gathered</b> in death <b>at his proper time like Abraham our forefather, as it is stated: “Yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all [<i>kakkol</i>] others”</b> (Job 24:24), indicating that when he repents from his arrogance he will die <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written about them</b> that they were blessed with the term “all,” as in the verse above. With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham <b>in all</b> things <b>[<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten <b>of all [<i>mikkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have <b>all [<i>khol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 33:11). <b>And if</b> one does <b>not</b> repent, then, the verse in Job continues: <b>“And wither like the tops of the husks.”</b> |
| Genesis 27:36 | as it is written: “And he said, ‘Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me twice? | Berakhot 7b:7 | Esau was not only angry over Isaac’s blessing, but he was angry about another matter as well, <b>as it is written: “And he said, ‘Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me twice?</b> He took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing’” (Genesis 27:36). Despite having sold his birthright, he refused to relinquish it. |
| Genesis 27:38 | as it is stated: “Have you but one blessing, my father?” | Sanhedrin 101b:3 | Apropos Manasseh’s repentance, the Gemara cites that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three came with a demand,</b> and <b>these are they: Cain, Esau, and Manasseh. Cain</b> came with a demand, <b>as it is written: “My sin is too great to bear”</b> (Genesis 4:13). Cain <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, is my transgression greater than</b> the transgression of <b>the 600,000 who are destined to sin before You</b> with the Golden Calf, <b>and You</b> will nevertheless <b>forgive them?</b> There should be atonement for my transgression as well. <b>Esau</b> came with a demand, <b>as it is stated: “Have you but one blessing, my father?”</b> (Genesis 27:38). With regard to Manasseh, <b>initially he called to multiple gods,</b> and his prayers were not answered, <b>and ultimately he called to the God of his forefathers</b> with the demand: If God does not answer my prayer, then apparently all the gods are equal to the God of my forefathers. |
| Genesis 27:40 | “And it shall come to pass when you shall break loose, | Shabbat 89b:3 | <b>And</b> the Jewish people <b>will say before Him: Master of the Universe, to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go <b>to Abraham, to whom You said: “Know certainly</b> that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf?</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Isaac, who blessed Esau</b> and said: <b>“And it shall come to pass when you shall break loose,</b> that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck” (Genesis 27:40), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Jacob, to whom You said: “I will go down to Egypt with you”</b> (Genesis 46:4), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> And if so, <b>to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go to our Patriarchs, who do not have mercy on us? Rather, <b>now God</b> Himself <b>says</b> what punishment we deserve. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Since you made yourselves dependent on Me, “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow.”</b> |
| Genesis 27:41 | him: “And Esau hated Jacob” | Berakhot 7b:6 | Tangential to the mention of Leah’s son, Judah, and the reason for his name, the Gemara explains the sources for other names, including <b>Reuben. Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Reuben’s name should be considered a prophecy by Leah, as <b>Leah said: See [<i>re’u</i>] the difference between my son [<i>beni</i>] and the son of my father-in-law,</b> Esau, son of Isaac. <b>Even though</b> Esau <b>knowingly sold his birthright</b> to his brother Jacob, <b>as it is written: “And he sold his birthright to Jacob”</b> (Genesis 25:33), nonetheless, <b>behold what is written</b> about <b>him: “And Esau hated Jacob”</b> (Genesis 27:41). |
| Genesis 27:45 | “Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?” | Sotah 13a:11 | <b>At that moment the prophecy of Rebecca was fulfilled, as it is written</b> that Rebecca said of Jacob and Esau: <b>“Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”</b> (Genesis 27:45), as Rebecca foresaw that the future bereavement for both her sons would be on the same day. The Gemara comments: <b>And although their deaths were not on the same day, in any event their burials were on the same day,</b> as Esau was killed and buried on the same day that Jacob was buried. |
| Genesis 28:9 | is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael” | Bava Kamma92b:13 | Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael”</b> (Genesis 28:9). It <b>is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him”</b> (Judges 11:3). <b>And</b> it <b>is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him</b> (Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <b>We learned</b> it <b>in a mishna</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:2): <b>All that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually impure</b> is <b>ritually impure; all that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually pure</b> is <b>ritually pure. And we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught</b> did the <b>starling go to the raven but because it is its kind,</b> as it too is a non-kosher bird. |
| Genesis 28:10 | As it is written: “And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran” | Chullin 91b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse means that <b>the sun, which set</b> early exclusively <b>for him,</b> also <b>shone</b> early exclusively <b>for him</b> in order to rectify the disparity created by the premature sunset. The Gemara explains when the sun set early for him: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran”</b> (Genesis 28:10). <b>And it is written</b> thereafter: <b>“And he encountered the place,</b> and he slept there, because the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). <b>When</b> Jacob <b>arrived at Haran, he said:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>I passed a place where my fathers prayed and I did not pray</b> there? <b>When he set his mind to return, the land contracted for him. Immediately</b> the verse states: <b>“And he encountered the place,”</b> indicating that he arrived there miraculously. |
| Genesis 28:10 | as it is written: “And Jacob departed from Beersheba and went to Haran” | Sanhedrin 95b:1 | is <b>as it is written: “And Jacob departed from Beersheba and went to Haran”</b> (Genesis 28:10), <b>and it is written</b> thereafter, ostensibly after he arrived in Haran: <b>“And he encountered [<i>vayyifga</i>] the place, and he slept there, for the sun had set”</b> (Genesis 28:11). This means that <b>when</b> Jacob <b>arrived at Haran, he said: Is it possible that I bypassed a place where my forefathers prayed and I did not pray there? He sought to return</b> to Beit El. <b>Once he contemplated in his mind to return, the land contracted for him,</b> and <b>immediately: “And he encountered the place,”</b> indicating that he arrived there unexpectedly, sooner than he would have arrived without a miracle. |
| Genesis 28:11 | Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [ vayifga ] the place and he slept there | Berakhot 26b:7 | <b>Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [<i>vayifga</i>] the place and he slept there</b> for the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). The word <b>encounter</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated</b> when God spoke to Jeremiah: <b>“And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [<i>tifga</i>] Me</b> for I do not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16). Jacob prayed during the evening, after the sun had set. |
| Genesis 28:11 | “And he encountered the place, | Chullin 91b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse means that <b>the sun, which set</b> early exclusively <b>for him,</b> also <b>shone</b> early exclusively <b>for him</b> in order to rectify the disparity created by the premature sunset. The Gemara explains when the sun set early for him: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran”</b> (Genesis 28:10). <b>And it is written</b> thereafter: <b>“And he encountered the place,</b> and he slept there, because the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). <b>When</b> Jacob <b>arrived at Haran, he said:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>I passed a place where my fathers prayed and I did not pray</b> there? <b>When he set his mind to return, the land contracted for him. Immediately</b> the verse states: <b>“And he encountered the place,”</b> indicating that he arrived there miraculously. |
| Genesis 28:11 | It is written: “And he took of the stones of the place, | Chullin 91b:8 | The Gemara cites another exposition of Rabbi Yitzḥak to explain an apparent contradiction between two verses pertaining to this incident. <b>It is written: “And he took of the stones of the place,</b> and placed them under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep” (Genesis 28:11). <b>And it is written:</b> “And Jacob rose up early in the morning, <b>and he took the stone</b> that he had placed under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it” (Genesis 28:18). The first verse indicates that Jacob took several stones, whereas the latter verse indicates that he took only one stone. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that all those stones gathered to one place and each one said:</b> Let <b>this righteous man place his head upon me.</b> And it was <b>taught: And all of them were absorbed into one</b> large rock. |
| Genesis 28:11 | “And he encountered [ vayyifga ] the place, and he slept there, for the sun had set” | Sanhedrin 95b:1 | is <b>as it is written: “And Jacob departed from Beersheba and went to Haran”</b> (Genesis 28:10), <b>and it is written</b> thereafter, ostensibly after he arrived in Haran: <b>“And he encountered [<i>vayyifga</i>] the place, and he slept there, for the sun had set”</b> (Genesis 28:11).

| Genesis 28:11 | “And he slept there because the sun had set” | Sanhedrin 95b:3 | It is written: <b>“And he slept there because the sun had set”</b> (Genesis 28:11). <b>After</b> Jacob <b>prayed</b> and <b>he sought to return</b> to his travels, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This righteous</b> man <b>came to My inn. Will</b> I allow <b>him to take leave without sleeping</b> here? <b>Immediately the sun set,</b> not at the proper time, <b>and that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to Jacob: <b>“And the sun shone for him</b> when he passed Penuel” (Genesis 32:32). The Gemara asks: <b>And did</b> the sun <b>shine only for him? But didn’t</b> the sun <b>shine for the entire world? Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The sun that set</b> not at the proper time exclusively <b>for him shone</b> not at the proper time exclusively <b>for him</b> in order to rectify the disparity created by the premature sunset. |
| Genesis 28:12 | “And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, | Chullin 91b:9 | The Gemara expounds other verses pertaining to the same incident. The verse states: <b>“And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth,</b> and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12). It was <b>taught: How wide was the ladder?</b> It was <b>eight thousand parasangs [<i>parsaot</i>], as it is written: “And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.”</b> The word <b>“ascending [<i>olim</i>],”</b> written in plural, indicates that there were <b>two</b> angels ascending simultaneously. Likewise, the term <b>“and descending [<i>veyordim</i>],”</b> also in the plural, indicates that <b>two</b> angels were descending simultaneously. <b>And when they met one another they were</b> a total of <b>four</b> in one place, so the ladder must have been wide enough to accommodate four angels. |
| Genesis 28:13 | “And behold, the Lord stood over him” | Chullin 91b:11 | It was <b>taught</b> that the angels were <b>ascending and gazing at the image of [<i>bidyokeno</i>]</b> Jacob <b>above,</b> engraved on the Throne of Glory, <b>and descending and gazing at his image below.</b> The angels subsequently became jealous of Jacob, and <b>wanted to endanger</b> his life. <b>Immediately</b> Jacob received divine protection, as the verse states: <b>“And behold, the Lord stood over him”</b> (Genesis 28:13). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Were it not written</b> in a <b>verse it would be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God, since it describes God as standing over Jacob to protect him from the angels <b>like a man who waves</b> a fan <b>over his son</b> to cool him down. |
| Genesis 28:13 | The land upon which you lie, | Chullin 91b:12 | The Gemara explains another verse from Jacob’s dream. “And behold, the Lord stood over him and said: I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. <b>The land upon which you lie,</b> to you will I give it, and to your seed” (Genesis 28:13). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the greatness</b> of this promise, i.e., why is it expressed in this way despite the fact that in a literal sense Jacob was lying on a very small amount of land? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, folded</b> up <b>the entirety of Eretz Yisrael and placed it under Jacob, our patriarch, so that it would be easy for his children to conquer.</b> |
| Genesis 28:13 | I said to Jacob: “The land upon which you lie, to you I will give it” | Sanhedrin 111a:10 | <b>I said to Jacob: “The land upon which you lie, to you I will give it”</b> (Genesis 28:13). <b>He sought a place to pitch his tent and he did not find</b> one <b>until he purchased</b> it <b>for one hundred coins, and he did not question My attributes, and did not say to Me: What is Your name? And you,</b> Moses, <b>ask Me: What is Your name, initially,</b> after witnessing My greatness more than they ever did. <b>And now you say to Me: “Neither have You delivered Your people”</b> (Exodus 5:23). The verse then states: <b>“Now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh”</b> (Exodus 6:1). One can infer: <b>The war with Pharaoh</b> and his downfall <b>you</b> shall <b>see, but you will not see the war with the thirty-one kings</b> in Eretz Yisrael, as you will not be privileged to conquer Eretz Yisrael for the Jewish people. |
| Genesis 28:14 | and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, | Shabbat 118b:1 | <b>on the inheritance of Jacob your father,</b> as the mouth of God has spoken” (Isaiah 58:13–14). The reward for delighting in Shabbat is specifically the portion of Jacob. <b>Not that of Abraham, about whom it is written, “Rise, walk through the land through its length</b> and its width because I have given it to you” (Genesis 13:17), i.e., only this land alone in its borders. <b>And not that of Isaac, about whom it is written,</b> “Dwell in this land and I will be with you and I will bless you <b>because I will give all of these lands to you and your offspring”</b> (Genesis 26:3), meaning these lands and no others. <b>Rather, that of Jacob, about whom it is written,</b> “And your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, <b>and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south,</b> and all of the families of the land will be blessed through you and your offspring” (Genesis 28:14). There are no boundaries for Jacob’s portion. |
| Genesis 28:15 | “Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go” | Berakhot 4a:16 | The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8). Why did Jacob not rely on God’s promise? Jacob had concerns and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Lest a transgression</b> that I might have committed after God made His promise to me <b>will cause</b> God to revoke His promise of protection. |
| Genesis 28:15 | “And I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go” | Sanhedrin 98b:5 | Rabba <b>said to him:</b> I am concerned <b>lest sin cause</b> me to suffer the pain despite the Torah study and the good deeds in which I engage, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi. As Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raises a contradiction. It is written</b> that God said to Jacob: <b>“And I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), <b>and it is written: “And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed”</b> (Genesis 32:8). If God assured Jacob that He would keep him, why was he concerned? |
| Genesis 28:18 | and he took the stone | Chullin 91b:8 | The Gemara cites another exposition of Rabbi Yitzḥak to explain an apparent contradiction between two verses pertaining to this incident. <b>It is written: “And he took of the stones of the place,</b> and placed them under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep” (Genesis 28:11). <b>And it is written:</b> “And Jacob rose up early in the morning, <b>and he took the stone</b> that he had placed under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it” (Genesis 28:18). The first verse indicates that Jacob took several stones, whereas the latter verse indicates that he took only one stone. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that all those stones gathered to one place and each one said:</b> Let <b>this righteous man place his head upon me.</b> And it was <b>taught: And all of them were absorbed into one</b> large rock. |
| Genesis 28:19 | Jacob, who called it house, as it is stated: “And he called the name of that place Beth-El” | Pesachim 88a:4 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse specifically mentions Jacob to allude to the fact that the Temple will ultimately be described in the same way that Jacob referred to it. It will <b>not</b> be referred to <b>as</b> it was referred to by <b>Abraham. It is written of him</b> that when he prayed at the location of the Temple mountain, he called it <b>mount, as it is stated: “As it is said on this day: On the mount where the Lord is seen”</b> (Genesis 22:14). <b>And</b> it will <b>not</b> be referred to <b>as</b> it was referred to by <b>Isaac. It is written of him</b> that he called the location of the Temple <b>field</b> when he prayed there, <b>as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate in the field”</b> (Genesis 24:63). <b>Rather,</b> it will be described <b>as</b> it was referred to by <b>Jacob, who called it house, as it is stated: “And he called the name of that place Beth-El”</b> (Genesis 28:19), which means house of God. |
| Genesis 28:22 | “And of all that You shall give me, I will surely give a tenth of it [ aser a’asrenu ] to You” | Ketubot 50a:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> who said: <b>What is the verse</b> that alludes to this maximum amount of charity? <b>“And of all that You shall give me, I will surely give a tenth of it [<i>aser a’asrenu</i>] to You”</b> (Genesis 28:22). The double use of the verb that means to donate one-tenth indicates that Jacob, who issued this statement, was actually referring to two-tenths, i.e., one-fifth. |
| Genesis 29:10 | isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [ vayhi ] when Jacob saw Rachel” | Megillah 10b:10 | The Gemara cites additional verses where <i>vayhi</i> is not indicative of impending grief: <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the four hundred and eightieth year”</b> (I Kings 6:1), which discusses the joyous occasion of the building of the Temple? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] when Jacob saw Rachel”</b> (Genesis 29:10), which was a momentous occasion? <b>And isn’t it written: “And it was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening, and it was [<i>vayhi</i>] morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5)? <b>And isn’t there the second</b> day of Creation, <b>and isn’t there the third</b> day, where the term <i>vayhi</i> is used? <b>And aren’t there many</b> verses in the Bible in which the term <i>vayhi</i> appears and no grief ensues? Apparently, the proposed principle is incorrect. |
| Genesis 29:12 | modesty that Rachel possessed? As it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son” | Bava Batra123a:18 | The Gemara now explains the second part of Rabbi Yonatan’s explanation: <b>And what</b> was a demonstration of the <b>modesty that Rachel possessed? As it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son”</b> (Genesis 29:12). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t he the son of her father’s sister?</b> Why did he say that he was her father’s brother? <b>Rather,</b> Jacob and Rachel had the following exchange: Jacob <b>said to</b> Rachel: <b>Will you marry me?</b> Rachel <b>said to him: Yes, but</b> my <b>father is a deceitful person, and you cannot defeat him.</b> |
| Genesis 29:12 | as it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, | Megillah 13b:2 | The Gemara explains: <b>What was the modesty shown by Rachel?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother,</b> and that he was Rebecca’s son” (Genesis 29:12). It may be asked: <b>Was he,</b> Jacob, in fact <b>her father’s brother? But wasn’t he the son of her father’s sister?</b> |
| Genesis 29:17 | with mercy? As it is written: “And Leah’s eyes were weak [ rakkot ]” | Bava Batra123a:14 | The Gemara explains this answer: <b>What</b> does it mean that <b>Leah advanced</b> ahead of Rachel <b>with mercy? As it is written: “And Leah’s eyes were weak [<i>rakkot</i>]”</b> (Genesis 29:17). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>rakkot</i>”? If we say</b> that her eyes were <b>literally weak,</b> is it <b>possible</b> that the verse would say that? <b>The verse</b> there <b>did not speak to the disparagement of</b> even <b>a non-kosher animal, as it is written: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are lacking purity”</b> (Genesis 7:8). The verse states: “That are lacking purity” rather than stating explicitly and disparagingly: That are impure. If that is so with regard to animals, <b>did the verse speak</b> here <b>to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term alludes to the fact <b>that her gifts,</b> i.e., the gifts given to her descendants, e.g., the priesthood and the monarchy, <b>were long-lasting [<i>arukkot</i>],</b> as they were passed down from generation to generation. |
| Genesis 29:23 | but they did not accept | Sotah 11b:17 | The next verse states: <b>“But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke about them [<i>aleihen</i>],</b> but they kept the male children alive” (Exodus 1:17). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: “Spoke <b>to them [<i>lahen</i>].” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Pharaoh <b>proposed to them to</b> engage in <b>a sinful act,</b> i.e., sexual intercourse, with him, <b>but they did not accept</b> his overtures. The word <i>aleihen</i> is often used in reference to sexual intercourse, for example: “And brought her to him; and he consorted with her [<i>eileha</i>]” (Genesis 29:23), and that is its connotation here as well. |
| Genesis 29:25 | And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah” | Bava Batra123a:20 | Laban did in fact attempt to have Jacob marry Leah instead of marrying Rachel. <b>When</b> Laban’s associates <b>were bringing Leah up</b> to the wedding canopy to marry Jacob, Rachel <b>thought: Now my sister will be humiliated</b> when Jacob discovers that she is the one marrying him. Therefore, Rachel <b>gave</b> the signs <b>to</b> Leah. <b>And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah”</b> (Genesis 29:25). This verse is difficult, as <b>by inference,</b> should one derive <b>that until now she was not Leah? Rather, through the signs that Jacob gave to Rachel and that she gave to Leah, he did not know</b> it was <b>she until that moment.</b> This is the modesty of Rachel to which Rabbi Yonatan was referring. |
| Genesis 29:25 | she gave them to her. And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah” | Megillah 13b:5 | <b>When the</b> wedding <b>night arrived,</b> and Laban planned to switch the sisters, Rachel <b>said</b> to herself: <b>Now my sister will be embarassed,</b> for Jacob will ask her for the signs and she will not know them. So <b>she gave them to her. And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah”</b> (Genesis 29:25). Does this imply <b>by inference that until now she was not Leah? Rather, due to the distinguishing signs that Rachel had given to Leah, he did not know until now,</b> when it was light outside, that she was Leah. <b>Therefore,</b> Rachel <b>merited that Saul should descend from her,</b> due to her act of modesty in not revealing to Jacob that she had shown the signs to Leah. |
| Genesis 29:31 | which is written: “And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, | Bava Batra123a:17 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> her desire not to marry Esau is the basis of that <b>which is written: “And the Lord saw that Leah was hated,</b> and He opened her womb” (Genesis 29:31). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“hated”? If we say</b> that she was <b>literally hated,</b> is it <b>possible? The verse</b> there <b>did not speak to the disparagement of</b> even <b>a non-kosher animal,</b> so <b>did the verse</b> here <b>speak to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, saw that the behavior of Esau was hated by her,</b> and therefore: <b>“And He opened her womb.”</b> |
| Genesis 29:35 | ‘This time I will give thanks to God,’ | Berakhot 7b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From the day the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world, no one thanked the Holy One, Blessed be He, until Leah came and thanked Him, as it is stated:</b> “And she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and she said, <b>‘This time I will give thanks to God,’</b> and thus he was called Judah” (Genesis 29:35). |
| Genesis 30:1 | “Give me children, or else I am dead” | Avodah Zarah5a:19 | <b>A blind person</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written: “He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead”</b> (Lamentations 3:6). <b>A leper</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written</b> that Aaron said to Moses when Miriam was struck with leprosy: <b>“Let her not, I pray, be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12). <b>And one who has no children</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written</b> that Rachel said to Jacob: <b>“Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1). |
| Genesis 30:1 | “Give me children, or else I am dead” | Nedarim 64b:6 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Any person who does not have children is considered like a dead</b> person. The source is <b>as is stated</b> in the words Rachel said to Jacob: <b>“Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four are considered as</b> if they were <b>dead: A pauper, and a leper, and a blind</b> person, <b>and one who has no children. A pauper, as it is written: “For all the men are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). As explained above, they were not actually dead but had descended into poverty, and yet they were considered dead. <b>A leper, as it is written</b> that Aaron said to Moses with regard to Miriam’s leprosy: <b>“Let her not, I pray, be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12). <b>And a blind</b> person, <b>as it is written: “He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead”</b> (Lamentations 3:6). <b>And one who has no children, as it is written: “Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1). |
| Genesis 30:14 | “And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest and found duda’im in the field” | Sanhedrin 99b:5 | Manasseh <b>said: But did Moses need to write only</b> insignificant matters that teach nothing, for example: <b>“And Lotan’s sister was Timna”</b> (Genesis 36:22), or: <b>“And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz,</b> son of Esau” (Genesis 36:12), or: <b>“And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest and found <i>duda’im</i> in the field”</b> (Genesis 30:14)? <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son. These things you have done, and should I have kept silence, you would imagine that I was like you, but I will reprove you, and set the matter before your eyes”</b> (Psalms 50:20–21). The verses in the Torah are not empty matters, with regard to which you can decide their import. |
| Genesis 30:14 | “And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest” | Sanhedrin 99b:9 | <b>“And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest”</b> (Genesis 30:14). <b>Rava, son of Rabbi Yitzḥak, says</b> that <b>Rav says: From here</b> it can be seen <b>that the righteous do not extend their hands</b> to engage <b>in robbery</b> even of small items, as rather than taking wheat, Reuben took only the ownerless <i>duda’im</i>. The verse continues: <b>“And he found <i>duda’im</i> in the field.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>duda’im</i>? Rav says:</b> They are a plant called <b><i>yavruḥei</i>. Levi says:</b> They are <b>violets. Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> They are <b><i>seviskei</i>.</b> |
| Genesis 30:16 | While with regard to Leah, it is written: “And Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me, for indeed I have hired you | Eruvin 100b:19 | <b>While with regard to Leah, it is written: “And Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me, for indeed I have hired you</b> with my son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:16). Her reward for demanding that Jacob fulfill the conjugal mitzva with her was the birth of Issachar, <b>and it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred, and all their brethren were at their commandment”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33). |
| Genesis 30:16 | “And he lay with her that night” | Niddah 31a:22 | <b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> the same as that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written,</b> with regard to Leah’s conceiving Issachar: <b>“And he lay with her that night”</b> (Genesis 30:16)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, contributed to that act.</b> The manner in which God contributed to this act is derived from another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned [<i>garem</i>] donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). This teaches that God directed Jacob’s <b>donkey</b> toward Leah’s tent so that he would engage in intercourse with her, thereby <b>causing [<i>garam</i>]</b> Leah’s conceiving <b>Issachar.</b> |
| Genesis 30:21 | “And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina” | Berakhot 60a:12 | <b>Is a prayer</b> in that case <b>ineffective? Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated: <b>“And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina”</b> (Genesis 30:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the addition of the word: <b>Afterwards?</b> What does the verse seek to convey by emphasizing that after the birth of Zebulun she gave birth to Dina? <b>Rav said: After Leah passed judgment on herself and said: Twelve tribes are destined to descend from Jacob, six came from me and four from the maidservants, that is ten,</b> and <b>if this</b> fetus <b>is male, my sister</b> Rachel <b>will not</b> even <b>be</b> the equivalent <b>of one the maidservants; immediately</b> the fetus <b>was transformed into a daughter, as it is stated: And she called her name Dina;</b> meaning she named her after her judgment [din]. The Gemara rejects this: <b>One does not mention miraculous acts</b> to teach general <i>halakha</i>. |
| Genesis 30:22 | a key to a woman, as it is stated: “And He opened her womb” | Bekhorot 45a:19 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Just as</b> there is <b>a key to a house, so too,</b> there is <b>a key to a woman, as it is stated: “And He opened her womb”</b> (Genesis 30:22). The Gemara challenges: The incident <b>involving the students of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who found that the woman had only four additional limbs rather than five, i.e., there was no key, poses <b>a difficulty for Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps since</b> it is <b>small, it dissolved</b> in the water when they boiled the corpse. |
| Genesis 30:22 | remembering. It is written about Rachel: “And God remembered Rachel” | Rosh Hashanah11a:16 | It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana, Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were revisited</b> by God and conceived children. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>revisiting [<i>pekida</i>]</b> and another instance of the term <b>revisiting,</b> and by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>remembering [<i>zekhira</i>]</b> and another instance of the word <b>remembering. It is written about Rachel: “And God remembered Rachel”</b> (Genesis 30:22), <b>and it is written about Hannah: “And the Lord remembered her”</b> (I Samuel 1:19). <b>And</b> the meaning of these instances of the term <b>remembering</b> is <b>derived</b> from another instance of the term <b>remembering, with regard to Rosh HaShana, as it is written: “A solemn rest, memorial proclaimed with the blast</b> of a <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 23:24). From here it is derived that Rachel and Hannah were remembered by God on Rosh HaShana. |
| Genesis 30:22 | to her, and He opened her womb” | Taanit 2b:1 | <b>to her, and He opened her womb”</b> (Genesis 30:22). <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the key of the resurrection of the dead</b> is maintained by God Himself? <b>As it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves”</b> (Ezekiel 37:13). |
| Genesis 30:23 | “And she conceived and gave birth to a son” | Taanit 8b:2 | Likewise, an expression of <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>giving birth is</b> also <b>stated with regard to rain.</b> Specifically, <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, as it is written</b> in the case of Rachel, when God had mercy on her: <b>“And she conceived and gave birth to a son”</b> (Genesis 30:23). <b>And giving birth is stated with regard to rain, as it is written:</b> “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, except it waters the earth <b>and causes it to give birth and bud”</b> (Isaiah 55:10). |
| Genesis 30:25 | Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: It is written: “And it came to pass, when Rachel gave birth to Joseph, | Bava Batra123b:2 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: It is written: “And it came to pass, when Rachel gave birth to Joseph,</b> that Jacob said to Laban: Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country” (Genesis 30:25). <b>What was different when Joseph was born,</b> that Jacob decided only then to return home? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him: Jacob our patriarch saw</b> prophetically <b>that the descendants of Esau</b> will be <b>delivered only to the hand of the descendants of Joseph, as it is stated: “And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for straw,</b> and they shall kindle in them, and devour them” (Obadiah 1:18). Jacob had left Eretz Yisrael to escape Esau, but he now felt confident that he could return without endangering his family. |
| Genesis 30:27 | “The Lord has blessed me because of you” | Berakhot 42a:8 | <b>Abaye said</b> that on a similar note, <b>we too will say: Immediately</b> following the entrance of <b>Torah scholars</b> into a house, a <b>blessing</b> rests upon that house, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Laban and Jacob: <b>“The Lord has blessed me because of you”</b> (Genesis 30:27). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead, that the proof is <b>from here, as it is stated:</b> “And it was from when he placed him in charge of his house and over all that he owned, <b>the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph”</b> (Genesis 39:5). |
| Genesis 30:27 | I have observed the signs, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake” | Sanhedrin 39b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that Ahab <b>said to</b> Obadiah: It <b>is written with regard to Jacob:</b> “And Laban said to him: If now I have found favor in your eyes, <b>I have observed the signs, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake”</b> (Genesis 30:27). It <b>is written with regard to Joseph: “The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake”</b> (Genesis 39:5). <b>The house of that man,</b> i.e., my house, <b>was not blessed. Perhaps you do not fear God?</b> Immediately, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: “Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly,” but the house of Ahab is not fit for blessing</b> like the houses of those masters. |
| Genesis 30:28 | “Appoint me [ nokva ] your wages, and I will give it” | Niddah 31b:7 | By contrast, <b>when a female comes into the world, nothing,</b> i.e., no sustenance, comes <b>with her.</b> This is derived from the homiletic interpretation of the word <b>female [<i>nekeva</i>]</b> as an abbreviation of the phrase: <b>She comes clean [<i>nekiya ba’a</i>],</b> i.e., empty. Furthermore, <b>until she says:</b> Give me <b>sustenance,</b> people <b>do not give her, as it is written</b> in Laban’s request of Jacob: <b>“Appoint me [<i>nokva</i>] your wages, and I will give it”</b> (Genesis 30:28). Laban used the word <i>nokva</i>, similar to <i>nekeva</i>, when he said that he would pay Jacob only if he explicitly demanded his wages. |
| Genesis 31:4 | “And Jacob sent and he called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock” | Berakhot 8b:14 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> From <b>what verse</b> is this derived? From the verse, <b>“And Jacob sent and he called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock”</b> (Genesis 31:4); it was only there in the field that he held counsel with them. |
| Genesis 31:24 | “Guard yourself from speaking to Jacob, from good to evil” | Nazir 23b:9 | The Gemara asks: From where is this principle derived? <b>As</b> it <b>is stated</b> in the verse that God warned Laban the Aramean, when he was chasing Jacob: <b>“Guard yourself from speaking to Jacob, from good to evil”</b> (Genesis 31:24). <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the warning against speaking <b>evil,</b> it is <b>fine</b> that Laban was warned not to harm Jacob. <b>However, why shouldn’t</b> he say anything <b>good</b> to Jacob? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this verse that even Laban’s <b>good is bad</b> in Jacob’s eyes? The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that it is so. |
| Genesis 31:24 | “Take heed to yourself that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad” | Yevamot 103b:1 | <b>is a disadvantage for the righteous,</b> as a righteous individual gains no pleasure from this so-called beneficial act. <b>As it is stated</b> by God to Laban: <b>“Take heed to yourself that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad”</b> (Genesis 31:24). <b>Granted,</b> speak no <b>bad; this is rightly so,</b> i.e., understandable. <b>But</b> speak no <b>good? Why not? Rather, learn from here</b> that even something that would be <b>a</b> good <b>benefit to the wicked</b> like Laban, <b>is a disadvantage for the righteous.</b> |
| Genesis 31:27 | “Why did you flee secretly [ naḥbeita ]” | Menachot 63a:3 | The reason these interpretations are insufficient is that one can also <b>say the opposite,</b> and suggest that the name <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates that the offering must be prepared in a closed vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for the secret</b> musings <b>of the heart, as it is written</b> that Laban said to Jacob: <b>“Why did you flee secretly [<i>naḥbeita</i>]”</b> (Genesis 31:27). Likewise, with regard to <b><i>marḥeshet</i>,</b> one can say that it must be prepared in an open vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for whispers [<i>reḥushei</i>]</b> of the mouth which are heard and revealed, <b>as people say: His lips were whispering [<i>meraḥashan</i>].</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili cannot derive the meanings of the terms <i>marḥeshet</i> and <i>maḥavat</i> from the verses; <b>rather,</b> his interpretation <b>is learned as a tradition.</b> |
| Genesis 31:35 | “For the manner of women is upon me [ derekh nashim li ]” | Avodah Zarah24b:20 | The Gemara examines the etymology of another term coined by the Persians. <b>Rav Ashi said: On what</b> basis <b>do the Persians call a menstruating woman</b> by the term <b><i>dashtana</i>?</b> It is <b>from here,</b> a verse in which Rachel claims to be a menstruating woman: <b>“For the manner of women is upon me [<i>derekh nashim li</i>]”</b> (Genesis 31:35). The word <i>dashtana</i> is a shortened form of the phrase <i>derekh nashim</i>. |
| Genesis 31:38 | as it is written: “And the rams of your flock I have not eaten” | Bava Kamma65b:18 | <b>A day-old ram is called a ram,</b> as can be derived from Jacob’s statement to Laban, <b>as it is written: “And the rams of your flock I have not eaten”</b> (Genesis 31:38). Now, did Jacob mean that <b>he did not eat</b> any of Laban’s <b>rams,</b> but younger <b>lambs he did eat?</b> This is certainly not the meaning of this verse, as this would mean he was a thief. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this verse that <b>a day-old ram is called a ram?</b> |
| Genesis 31:40 | “Thus I was: In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night” | Bava Metzia93b:3 | Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabba from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what extent is a paid bailee obligated to safeguard?</b> He is obligated <b>to the extent</b> that Jacob said to Laban: <b>“Thus I was: In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night”</b> (Genesis 31:40). Rava <b>said to him: There too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of city watchmen,</b> whose responsibility extends further. Abaye <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that <b>Jacob, our forefather,</b> whose statement is the source of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>was a city watchman?</b> Rava replied: It means <b>that</b> Jacob <b>said to Laban: I safeguarded for you an extra</b> level of <b>safeguarding, like</b> that of <b>city watchmen.</b> |
| Genesis 31:41 | “These twenty years have I been in your house” | Avodah Zarah9a:3 | § Apropos the above <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa said: If this <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., one who dates years in reference to the destruction of the Temple, <b>forgot and did not know the details</b> of the date with regard to exactly <b>how much</b> time had passed since the destruction of the Temple, e.g., he remembered the century but could not recall the exact decade and year, <b>let him ask a scribe</b> who writes official documents <b>how many</b> years <b>he writes</b> when he dates the documents. The dating system of scribes uses as its starting point the beginning of the Greek rule, 380 years before the destruction of the Temple. <b>And let him add 20 years to</b> the number, <b>and</b> in this manner <b>he</b> will <b>find his number [<i>leḥumreih</i>]. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the verse: <b>“These twenty years have I been in your house”</b> (Genesis 31:41). |
| Genesis 31:43 | “The daughters are my daughters and the children are my children” | Yevamot 62b:6 | <b>Rabba said to Rava bar Mari: From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived, that <b>grandchildren are</b> considered <b>like children? If we say</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> in Laban’s speech to Jacob: <b>“The daughters are my daughters and the children are my children”</b> (Genesis 31:43), which indicates that Jacob’s children were also considered to be the children of their grandfather Laban, <b>if</b> that is <b>so,</b> does the continuation of Laban’s statement: <b>“And the flocks are my flocks”</b> (Genesis 31:43), indicate that <b>so too,</b> Jacob’s flocks were considered as belonging to Laban? <b>Rather,</b> Laban was saying <b>that you,</b> Jacob, <b>acquired</b> them <b>from me. Here too,</b> with regard to the children, Laban was saying: <b>You acquired</b> them <b>from me,</b> i.e., it is only due to me that you have children. |
| Genesis 31:47 | “ Yegar sahaduta ” | Megillah 9a:5 | The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, what is the reason</b> that they must be written in Hebrew? The Gemara explains: It is <b>because it is written with regard to them: “And</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that <b>as they are so shall they be,</b> without change. The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible is there? Granted,</b> in the <b>Torah there is</b> a verse written in Aramaic translation: <b>“<i>Yegar sahaduta</i>”</b> (Genesis 31:47); <b>however, here,</b> in phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> verses in Aramaic <b>translation are there</b> that could be written in Hebrew? |
| Genesis 31:47 | Yegar Sahaduta, | Shabbat 115b:5 | Rav Huna bar Ḥaluv <b>raised an objection to his</b> opinion from that which we learned: A verse that is originally written in Aramaic <b>translation that was written</b> in the language of <b>the Bible, and</b> a verse that is originally written in the language of <b>the Bible that was written</b> in Aramaic <b>translation, and</b> a Torah that was written in ancient <b>Hebrew script, one rescues</b> them <b>from the fire</b> on Shabbat. <b>And, needless to say,</b> one saves the verses written in Aramaic <b>translation that are in</b> the book of <b>Ezra, and that are in</b> the book of <b>Daniel, and that are in the Torah. What are the</b> verses originally written in Aramaic <b>translation in the Torah?</b> It is the verse: “And Laban called it <b>Yegar Sahaduta,</b> and Jacob called it Gal Ed” (Genesis 31:47), <b>and</b> apparently, it is rescued, <b>even though there are not eighty-five letters in it.</b> Rav Naḥman answered him: That is no proof, as <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught,</b> it was in a case where the Aramaic verse is counted <b>to complete</b> the total of eighty-five letters, but it is not independently significant. |
| Genesis 31:50 | conjugal rights, which is stated in the Torah, and so it says: “If you shall afflict [ te’aneh ] my daughters” | Ketubot 47b:10 | § <b>Rava said: This <i>tanna</i>,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited below, <b>maintains</b> that the obligation of a husband to provide his wife’s <b>sustenance</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is taught</b> with regard to the verse pertaining to a husband’s obligations toward his wife: “If he takes another wife for himself, her food [<i>she’era</i>], her clothing [<i>kesuta</i>], and her conjugal rights [<i>onata</i>], he shall not diminish” (Exodus 21:10). <b>“<i>She’era</i>”; this is sustenance, and it likewise states: “Who also eat the flesh [<i>she’er</i>] of my people”</b> (Micah 3:3). <b>“<i>Kesuta</i>” is</b> understood <b>in its literal sense</b> as referring to clothing. <b>“<i>Onata</i>”; this is</b> her <b>conjugal rights, which is stated in the Torah, and so it says: “If you shall afflict [<i>te’aneh</i>] my daughters”</b> (Genesis 31:50), which indicates that a husband may not deprive his wife of her conjugal rights. |
| Genesis 31:50 | “If you shall afflict my daughters” | Yoma 74b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive it</b> not from the verse that indicates affliction of hunger but from the verse where Laban warns Jacob: <b>“If you shall afflict my daughters”</b> (Genesis 31:50), which is referring not to hunger but to marital relations. The Gemara answers: <b>We derive affliction</b> commanded to <b>the public</b> on Yom Kippur <b>from affliction</b> relating to <b>the public,</b> i.e., the Jewish people in the desert, <b>and we do not derive affliction</b> of <b>the public from affliction</b> of <b>an individual,</b> as in the case of Jacob’s wives. |
| Genesis 31:50 | wives | Yoma 77a:14 | § The Gemara continues to clarify another of the afflictions of Yom Kippur: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that refraining from <b>conjugal relations is called affliction? As it is written,</b> Laban said to Jacob: <b>“If you shall afflict my daughters, and if you shall take</b> other <b>wives</b> beside my daughters” (Genesis 31:50). |
| Genesis 32:2 | encountered but did not touch, like that which is written: “And the angels of God encountered him” | Chullin 18b:11 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does encountered mean <b>encountered and touched it, as it is written: “And he encountered him and he died”</b> (I Kings 2:25); <b>or perhaps</b> it means <b>encountered but did not touch, like that which is written: “And the angels of God encountered him”</b> (Genesis 32:2)? |
| Genesis 32:3 | “And Jacob said when he saw them [ ra’am ]: | Berakhot 62b:15 | <b>Rav said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>the patriarch, Jacob,</b> about whom the term seeing is used: <b>“And Jacob said when he saw them [<i>ra’am</i>]:</b> This is God’s camp” (Genesis 32:3). <b>And Shmuel said: He saw</b> and remembered <b>Isaac’s ashes, as it is said</b> in the portion of the binding of Isaac: <b>“God will provide [<i>yireh</i>] Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering”</b> (Genesis 22:8). |
| Genesis 32:8 | it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid, | Berakhot 4a:16 | The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8). Why did Jacob not rely on God’s promise? Jacob had concerns and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Lest a transgression</b> that I might have committed after God made His promise to me <b>will cause</b> God to revoke His promise of protection. |
| Genesis 32:8 | and it is written: “And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed” | Sanhedrin 98b:5 | Rabba <b>said to him:</b> I am concerned <b>lest sin cause</b> me to suffer the pain despite the Torah study and the good deeds in which I engage, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi. As Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raises a contradiction. It is written</b> that God said to Jacob: <b>“And I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), <b>and it is written: “And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed”</b> (Genesis 32:8). If God assured Jacob that He would keep him, why was he concerned? |
| Genesis 32:9 | then the camp that is left shall escape” | Sanhedrin 39b:13 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>did Obadiah merit prophecy?</b> It is <b>because he concealed one hundred prophets in a cave, as it is stated: “It was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them, fifty men in a cave,</b> and fed them with bread and water” (I Kings 18:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> i.e., why did he decide, to conceal <b>fifty men</b> in each of two caves and not conceal them all together in one cave? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He learned from</b> the behavior of <b>Jacob</b> to do so, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And he said: If Esau comes to the one camp and smites it, <b>then the camp that is left shall escape”</b> (Genesis 32:9). Obadiah learned from this to divide the prophets and thereby lessen the danger. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> It is <b>because there is no cave</b> big enough <b>to contain more than fifty</b> people. |
| Genesis 32:11 | “I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, | Shabbat 32a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yannai would examine</b> the ferry <b>and cross.</b> The Gemara comments that <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> acted <b>in accordance with his reasoning</b> stated elsewhere, as <b>he said: A person should never stand in a place of danger saying that they</b> on High <b>will perform a miracle for him, lest</b> in the end <b>they do not perform a miracle for him. And,</b> moreover, even <b>if they do perform a miracle for him, they will deduct it from his merits. Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? When Jacob said: <b>“I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth,</b> which You have shown unto Your servant” (Genesis 32:11), and he explains: Since You have bestowed upon me so much kindness and truth, my merits have been diminished. Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Zeira would not go out</b> and walk <b>among the palm trees on a day when there was a southern wind</b> blowing due to the fear that the trees might fall on him. |
| Genesis 32:11 | As it is written: “I have become small from all the mercies and all the truth | Taanit 20b:8 | The Gemara explains: Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>holds in accordance with this</b> statement, <b>as Rabbi Yannai said: A person should never stand in a place of danger and say: A miracle will be performed for me,</b> and I will escape unharmed, <b>lest a miracle is not performed for him. And if you say</b> that <b>a miracle</b> will be <b>performed for him, they will deduct it from his merits. Rav Ḥanan said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this idea? <b>As it is written: “I have become small from all the mercies and all the truth</b> that You have showed Your servant” (Genesis 32:11). In other words, the more benevolence one receives from God, the more his merit is reduced. |
| Genesis 32:15 | that which is written: “Two hundred reḥelim ” | Chullin 137b:12 | § <b>When Isi bar Hini ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found him teaching</b> the mishna <b>to his son.</b> Isi taught that the obligation of the first sheared wool applies only in the case of <b>sheep [<i>reḥelim</i>],</b> the masculine plural form of <i>raḥel</i>, meaning a sheep. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: You should <b>teach him</b> using the term <b><i>reḥelot</i>,</b> the feminine plural form. Isi <b>said to him</b> in reply: I teach the mishna in accordance with <b>that which is written: “Two hundred <i>reḥelim</i>”</b> (Genesis 32:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: The <b>language</b> of the <b>Torah is distinct</b> and the <b>language</b> of the <b>Sages is distinct,</b> i.e., these are like two separate languages, and the Sages do not always use the same forms that appear in the Bible. In this case, they use <i>reḥelot</i> rather than <i>reḥelim</i>. |
| Genesis 32:25 | “And Jacob was left alone; | Chullin 91a:22 | The Gemara returns to the verse of Jacob wrestling with the angel. The verse states: <b>“And Jacob was left alone;</b> and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day” (Genesis 32:25). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The reason Jacob remained alone was <b>that he remained</b> to collect some <b>small pitchers</b> that had been left behind. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the possessions of the righteous are dearer to them than their bodies. And why</b> do they care <b>so much</b> about their possessions? It is <b>because they do not stretch out their hands to</b> partake of <b>stolen property.</b> |
| Genesis 32:26 | as he wrestled with him” | Chullin 91a:14 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the sciatic nerve of the right thigh is forbidden because <b>the verse states:</b> “And when he saw that he could not prevail against him, he touched the spoon of his thigh; and the spoon of Jacob’s thigh was strained, <b>as he wrestled with him”</b> (Genesis 32:26). The angel grappled with Jacob <b>like a man who hugs another</b> in order to throw him to the ground, <b>and his hand reaches to the spoon of the right</b> thigh <b>of the other.</b> |
| Genesis 32:26 | “As he wrestled with him” | Chullin 91a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they derive</b> from <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“As he wrestled with him”</b> (Genesis 32:26)? The Gemara answers: They <b>require it for the other</b> interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> This <b>teaches that the dust [<i>avak</i>] from their feet ascended to the throne of glory. It is written here: “As he wrestled [<i>behe’avko</i>] with him,” and it is written there</b> in a description of how God will punish the wicked: “The Lord, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, <b>and the clouds are the dust of His feet”</b> (Nahum 1:3). |
| Genesis 32:27 | “And he said: Let me go, for the dawn has risen. | Chullin 91b:13 | The Gemara returns to the verses that describe Jacob wrestling with the angel. <b>“And he said: Let me go, for the dawn has risen.</b> And he said: I will not let you go until you bless me” (Genesis 32:27). Jacob <b>said to</b> the angel: <b>Are you a thief, or are you a gambler [<i>kuveyustus</i>], who is afraid of dawn?</b> The angel <b>said to him: I am an angel, and from the day I was created my time to recite a song</b> before God <b>has not arrived, until now.</b> Now I must ascend so that I can sing songs of praise to God. |
| Genesis 32:27 | states: “And he said: Let me go, | Chullin 92a:3 | The verse in Hosea states: <b>“He wept, and made supplication to him.”</b> From this verse <b>I do not know who cried to whom. When</b> another verse <b>states: “And he said: Let me go,</b> for the dawn has risen” (Genesis 32:27), <b>you must say</b> that <b>the angel cried to Jacob.</b> |
| Genesis 32:29 | But if that is so, one who calls Jacob Jacob, | Berakhot 13a:11 | Again, the Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so, one who calls Jacob Jacob,</b> about whom it is written: “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel” (Genesis 32:29), <b>also</b> transgresses a mitzva. |
| Genesis 32:29 | for you have striven with angels | Chullin 92a:2 | The Gemara continues to discuss Jacob wrestling with the angel. The prophet states: <b>“So he strove [<i>vayyasar</i>] with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him;</b> at Beth El he would find him, and there he would speak with us” (Hosea 12:5). From this verse <b>I do not know who became master [<i>sar</i>],</b> i.e., was victorious, <b>over whom. When</b> another verse <b>states:</b> “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels</b> and with men, and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29), <b>you must say</b> that <b>Jacob became master over the angel.</b> |
| Genesis 32:29 | for you have striven with angels [ elohim ] and with men, | Chullin 92a:4 | The verse states: “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels [<i>elohim</i>] and with men,</b> and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29). <b>Rabba says:</b> The angel <b>intimated to</b> Jacob <b>that in the future two princes would emerge from him:</b> They are the <b>Exilarch who is in Babylonia and the <i>Nasi</i> who is in Eretz Yisrael.</b> And <b>from here he</b> also <b>intimated to</b> Jacob that there would be <b>an exile.</b> |
| Genesis 32:32 | from here: “And the sun rose for him | Chullin 91b:4 | <b>Rav said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “And the sun rose for him</b> as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh” (Genesis 32:32). This indicates that Jacob remained where he was all night and left in the morning, because a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night. |
| Genesis 32:32 | “And the sun shone for him | Chullin 91b:5 | The Gemara cites an incident involving the final verse cited above. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: I asked</b> the following question of <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua in the meat market [<i>be’itliz</i>] of</b> the town <b>Emmaus, where they went to purchase an animal for the</b> wedding <b>feast of Rabban Gamliel’s son: It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And the sun shone for him</b> when he passed Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh” (Genesis 32:32). <b>But did the sun shine only for him? Didn’t it shine for the entire world?</b> |
| Genesis 32:32 | of Rabbi Yehuda, | Sanhedrin 59a:12 | But a mitzva that was stated <b>with regard to the descendants of Noah and was not repeated at Sinai</b> among the mitzvot given to the Jewish people <b>was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah. And we have only</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the sciatic nerve</b> to which this classification applies, <b>and</b> this is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sciatic nerve, which is on the hollow of the thigh, until this day” (Genesis 32:32), is referring to the sons of Jacob, who were commanded to observe this prohibition even though they had the status of descendants of Noah. |
| Genesis 32:32 | “And the sun shone for him | Sanhedrin 95b:3 | It is written: <b>“And he slept there because the sun had set”</b> (Genesis 28:11). <b>After</b> Jacob <b>prayed</b> and <b>he sought to return</b> to his travels, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This righteous</b> man <b>came to My inn.

The Gemara asks: <b>And did</b> the sun <b>shine only for him? But didn’t</b> the sun <b>shine for the entire world? Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The sun that set</b> not at the proper time exclusively <b>for him shone</b> not at the proper time exclusively <b>for him</b> in order to rectify the disparity created by the premature sunset. |
| Genesis 32:33 | is also precise, as it teaches: Rabbi Yehuda said: Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob, | Chullin 100b:14 | According to this answer, the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Rabbi Yehuda said: Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> This indicates that the basis of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is the fact that the sciatic nerve was forbidden to the children of Jacob, who had the status of descendants of Noah. |
| Genesis 32:33 | Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob, | Chullin 100b:3 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to a kosher</b> animal <b>and does not apply to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It applies <b>even to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in explanation: <b>Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> Since the sciatic nerve of non-kosher animals became forbidden at that time, it remains forbidden now. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: The prohibition <b>was stated in Sinai, but</b> it <b>was written in its place,</b> in the battle of Jacob and the angel despite the fact that the prohibition did not take effect then. |
| Genesis 32:33 | it is different there, because the verse states: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” | Chullin 101a:3 | <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Actually</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> and therefore they are not subject to the prohibition of eating non-kosher meat. <b>And</b> the reason the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerves does not apply to non-kosher animals is that <b>it is different there, because the verse states: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve”</b> (Genesis 32:33). This teaches that the prohibition applies only to a species <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve is forbidden but whose meat is permitted,</b> and <b>excludes this</b> case of a non-kosher animal, <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> would be <b>forbidden and whose meat</b> would also be <b>forbidden.</b> |
| Genesis 32:33 | the children of Jacob, | Chullin 101b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in explanation: <b>Wasn’t</b> the sciatic nerve forbidden for <b>the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), yet the meat of a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them? Since the sciatic nerve of non-kosher animals became forbidden at that time, it remains forbidden now. |
| Genesis 32:33 | the thigh” | Chullin 134b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> for this, i.e., how is it understood from the definite article that the verse is referring to the right foreleg? The Gemara responds: It is derived <b>like that</b> which <b>Rava said</b> with regard to the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sciatic nerve which is upon the hollow of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33). The definite article indicates that this is referring to <b>the most important thigh. Here too,</b> the definite article in the term <b>“the foreleg”</b> indicates that the verse is referring to <b>the most important foreleg,</b> i.e., the right foreleg. |
| Genesis 32:33 | that | Chullin 89b:3 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating <b>the sciatic nerve applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of,</b> i.e., the time of, <b>the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And it applies to domesticated animals and to undomesticated animals, to</b> the <b>thigh of the right</b> leg <b>and to</b> the <b>thigh of the left</b> leg. <b>But it does not apply to a bird, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse makes reference to the sciatic nerve as being “upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), and a bird <b>has no spoon</b> of the thigh. |
| Genesis 32:33 | is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not | Chullin 90b:4 | § The Gemara cites another discussion with regard to the sciatic nerve of a burnt offering. <b>Rav Huna says: The sciatic nerve of a burnt offering</b> is not placed upon the altar with the rest of the animal. Rather, <b>one removes it</b> and places it <b>on the</b> circular <b>mound</b> of ashes in the center of the altar. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Master of this [<i>mari dikhi</i>]</b> ruling! <b>Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>Therefore the altar does not consume</b> the sciatic nerve? This would indicate that it is prohibited to sacrifice the sciatic nerve on the altar. Rather, it <b>is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not</b> the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33). |
| Genesis 32:33 | the thigh” | Chullin 91a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that only the sciatic nerve of the right thigh is forbidden by Torah law? <b>Rava said</b> that it is because the <b>verse states:</b> “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve that is upon the spoon of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33). The definite article indicates that this is referring to <b>the most important thigh.</b> |
| Genesis 32:33 | does not apply to a bird | Chullin 92b:2 | § The mishna teaches (89b) that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>does not apply to a bird</b> due to the fact that the verse is referring to the sciatic nerve as being “upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), and a bird has no spoon of the thigh. The Gemara challenges: <b>But we see that it does have</b> a protrusion of flesh on its thigh. The Gemara answers: <b>It has</b> a protrusion, <b>but</b> that protrusion is <b>not rounded.</b> |
| Genesis 32:33 | upon the spoon of the thigh” | Chullin 96a:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>One who eats</b> an olive-bulk <b>of the sciatic nerve</b> incurs forty lashes. <b>Shmuel says: The Torah prohibits only</b> the part of the sciatic nerve <b>that is on the</b> rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like <b>a spoon</b> that is near the end of the femur. This is <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve that is <b>upon the spoon of the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33). |
| Genesis 32:33 | “the thigh” | Horayot 12a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rava said</b> with regard to the term <b>“the thigh”</b> in the verse: “The sciatic nerve that is on the hollow of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33); the reference is to <b>the stronger of the thighs. Here too,</b> where the verse states: <b>“The anointed,”</b> the reference is to <b>the</b> most <b>distinguished of</b> those <b>anointed,</b> i.e., the High Priest. |
| Genesis 32:33 | the spoon of the thigh, | Keritot 21a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the sciatic nerve</b> of a <i>koy</i> is prohibited? The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> the prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>dependent on</b> the presence of <b>the spoon of the thigh,</b> as it is stated: “Therefore the children of Israel shall not eat the sciatic nerve which is upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), <b>and this</b> <i>koy</i> <b>has a spoon [<i>kaf</i> ] of the thigh,</b> i.e., a round protrusion of flesh in its thigh that is shaped like a spoon. |
| Genesis 32:33 | the thigh” | Kiddushin 21b:11 | <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>“The awl,”</b> this serves <b>to include the large awl</b> for piercing. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that this expression is referring to a large awl? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as Rava said</b> with regard to the verse: “The sinew of the thigh vein which is upon the hollow of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33), that this is referring to <b>the most important [<i>meyummenet</i>]</b> part of <b>the thigh.</b> The definite article indicates something clear and obvious. <b>Here too,</b> the term <b>“the awl”</b> is referring to <b>a special awl.</b> |
| Genesis 32:33 | the sciatic nerve, as the Merciful One says: “Therefore the children of Israel may not eat the sciatic nerve” | Pesachim 22a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raised an objection: And</b> yet there is still the prohibition of <b>the sciatic nerve, as the Merciful One says: “Therefore the children of Israel may not eat the sciatic nerve”</b> (Genesis 32:33), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A person</b> may <b>send the thigh</b> of an animal <b>to a gentile</b> as a gift <b>with the sciatic nerve inside it,</b> he is not required to remove it. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>its place is clear,</b> and it is obvious that this nerve has not been removed. Therefore, there is no concern that another Jew will assume that the first Jew removed this portion of the animal, which might cause him to accidentally eat the sciatic nerve. Apparently, one may benefit from this prohibited portion of the animal even though the verse says that one may not eat it. |
| Genesis 33:3 | from here: “And he passed [ avar ] before them” | Megillah 21b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is the language of precedence? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that the verse states: “And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran [<i>vaya’avor</i>] the Cushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Cushite. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king passed [<i>vaya’avor</i>] before them and the Lord at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13). |
| Genesis 33:3 | from here: “And he passed [ avar ] before them” | Niddah 63a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is a formulation of priority?

| Genesis 33:3 | from here: “And he passed [ avar ] before them” | Pesachim 119b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where may it be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is a formulation</b> that means <b>before</b> an action is performed? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And Ahimaaz ran by way of the square and he passed [<i>vaya’avor</i>] the Kushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Kushite. <b>Abaye said</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>Some say</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king shall pass on [<i>vaya’avor</i>] before them, and God at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13). |
| Genesis 33:3 | from here: “And he passed [ avar ] before them” | Pesachim 7b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where may it be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is the language of priority? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that the verse said: “And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran [<i>vaya’avor</i>] the Cushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Cushite. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king passed [<i>vaya’avor</i>] before them and God at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13). |
| Genesis 33:10 | as one sees the face of angels, and you were pleased with me” | Sotah 41b:9 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> that this can be proven <b>from here.</b> Jacob said to Esau: “I have seen your face, <b>as one sees the face of angels, and you were pleased with me”</b> (Genesis 33:10). Jacob flattered him by comparing seeing him to seeing a divine vision. |
| Genesis 33:10 | as one sees the face of [ penei ] God, and you were pleased with me” | Sukkah 5b:2 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from the face of God, as it is written:</b> “For I have seen your face <b>as one sees the face of [<i>penei</i>] God, and you were pleased with me”</b> (Genesis 33:10). The term <i>penei</i> is used with regard to the face of God as well. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> |
| Genesis 33:11 | everything” | Bava Batra17a:1 | <b>a taste of the World-to-Come. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And the Lord blessed Abraham <b>with everything”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Isaac, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And I have eaten <b>from everything”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Jacob, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “Because I have <b>everything”</b> (Genesis 33:11). This teaches that already in their lifetimes they merited everything, i.e., perfection. |
| Genesis 33:11 | all [ khol ]” | Sotah 5a:5 | He continues the interpretation: <b>But if he repents from</b> his arrogance, <b>he is gathered</b> in death <b>at his proper time like Abraham our forefather, as it is stated: “Yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all [<i>kakkol</i>] others”</b> (Job 24:24), indicating that when he repents from his arrogance he will die <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written about them</b> that they were blessed with the term “all,” as in the verse above. With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham <b>in all</b> things <b>[<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten <b>of all [<i>mikkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have <b>all [<i>khol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 33:11). <b>And if</b> one does <b>not</b> repent, then, the verse in Job continues: <b>“And wither like the tops of the husks.”</b> |
| Genesis 33:12 | “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you” | Avodah Zarah8b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Initially,</b> when the Romans acted faithfully, <b>what</b> verse <b>did they interpret, and ultimately,</b> when they subjugated the Jews, <b>what</b> verse <b>did they interpret? Initially, they interpreted</b> the verse where Esau said to Jacob upon their meeting: <b>“Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you”</b> (Genesis 33:12). In this verse, Esau equates himself to Jacob, prefiguring the initial Roman treatment of the Jews. <b>And ultimately, they interpreted</b> the verse that recites Jacob’s response to Esau: <b>“Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant”</b> (Genesis 33:14), demonstrating Jacob’s subjugation to Esau, and by extension that of the Jews to Rome. |
| Genesis 33:12 | from here: “And he said: Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go corresponding to you” | Chagigah 5b:6 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the same idea can be derived <b>from here: “And he said: Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go corresponding to you”</b> (Genesis 33:12). Just as the Jewish people rise and fall, so too, the nations of the world simultaneously rise and fall, and they will never have an advantage. |
| Genesis 33:14 | until I come unto my lord unto Seir” | Avodah Zarah25b:8 | Furthermore, if the gentile <b>asks him where he is going,</b> the Jew should <b>extend the journey</b> when relating his destination <b>to him,</b> i.e., he should claim that he is traveling to a place beyond his actual destination, <b>in the manner that Jacob our father did to the wicked Esau. As it is written</b> that Jacob said to Esau: “Let my lord pass over before his servant and I will journey on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, <b>until I come unto my lord unto Seir”</b> (Genesis 33:14). |
| Genesis 33:14 | “Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant” | Avodah Zarah8b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Initially,</b> when the Romans acted faithfully, <b>what</b> verse <b>did they interpret, and ultimately,</b> when they subjugated the Jews, <b>what</b> verse <b>did they interpret? Initially, they interpreted</b> the verse where Esau said to Jacob upon their meeting: <b>“Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you”</b> (Genesis 33:12). In this verse, Esau equates himself to Jacob, prefiguring the initial Roman treatment of the Jews. <b>And ultimately, they interpreted</b> the verse that recites Jacob’s response to Esau: <b>“Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant”</b> (Genesis 33:14), demonstrating Jacob’s subjugation to Esau, and by extension that of the Jews to Rome. |
| Genesis 33:17 | “And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, | Avodah Zarah25b:9 | The Gemara continues: <b>And it is written</b> subsequently: <b>“And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,</b> and built himself a house” (Genesis 33:17). Rather than meeting Esau in Seir, Jacob traveled to the nearer location of Succoth. Telling a gentile that one is traveling to a farther destination might cause the gentile to defer his attack due to the assumption that he has a longer period of time to plan and execute it. As a result of the delay, the Jew has a better chance of reaching his true destination safely. |
| Genesis 33:17 | left Aram-naharaim and came to Sukkot, and spent eighteen months there, as it is stated: “And Jacob journeyed to Sukkot, built himself a house, and made booths [ sukkot ] for his cattle” | Megillah 17a:7 | The Gemara raises an objection: But <b>ultimately,</b> Jacob was in <b>Laban’s house for</b> only <b>twenty years.</b> Why, then, is he faulted for being away from his father for twenty-two years? <b>Rather,</b> he was punished <b>because on his journey</b> back from Aram-naharaim <b>he tarried</b> another <b>two years</b> before returning home to his parents, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Jacob <b>left Aram-naharaim and came to Sukkot, and spent eighteen months there, as it is stated: “And Jacob journeyed to Sukkot, built himself a house, and made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] for his cattle”</b> (Genesis 33:17). The Gemara understands this verse to mean that first he made booths [<i>Sukkot</i>], to live in during the summer, and then he built a house in the winter, and afterward he again made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] during the next summer, indicating that he must have been there for eighteen months. <b>He then was in Bethel for six months, and he brought offerings,</b> totaling two years in all. In this way, all the various calculations of years are reconciled. |
| Genesis 33:18 | as it is written: “And Jacob came whole | Shabbat 33b:10 | Rabbi Shimon <b>said: Since a miracle transpired</b> for me, <b>I will go</b> and <b>repair something</b> for the sake of others in gratitude for God’s kindness, <b>as it is written: “And Jacob came whole</b> to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and he graced the countenance of the city” (Genesis 33:18). <b>Rav said,</b> the meaning of: And Jacob came whole, is: <b>Whole in his body, whole in his money, whole in his Torah.</b> And what did he do? <b>And he graced the countenance of the city;</b> he performed gracious acts to benefit the city. <b>Rav said:</b> Jacob <b>established a currency for them. And Shmuel said: He established marketplaces for them. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He established bathhouses for them.</b> In any event, clearly one for whom a miracle transpires should perform an act of kindness for his neighbors as a sign of gratitude. <b>He said: Is there something that needs repair? They said to him: There is a place where there is uncertainty with regard to ritual impurity</b> |
| Genesis 33:19 | a hundred kesita ” | Rosh Hashanah26a:18 | The Gemara records a series of similar statements: <b>And Rabbi Akiva said: When I went to Galia,</b> I heard that <b>they called a menstruating woman <i>galmuda</i>,</b> and this clarifies the meaning of that word in Scripture. It should be understood as follows: <b>What</b> does <b><i>galmuda</i></b> mean? <b>She is separated [<i>gemula da</i>] from her husband,</b> as all physical contact between a menstruating woman and her husband is forbidden. <b>And Rabbi Akiva said: When I went to Africa,</b> I heard that <b>they called a <i>ma’a</i>,</b> which is a certain coin, <b><i>kesita</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>significance of this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To explain</b> that the words <b>in the Torah</b> relating to Jacob’s purchase of his field near Shechem: “And he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, from the sons of Hamor for <b>a hundred <i>kesita</i>”</b> (Genesis 33:19), denote <b>a hundred <i>dankei</i>,</b> i.e., a hundred <i>ma’a.</i> |
| Genesis 33:20 | and he called it El, God of Israel” | Megillah 18a:17 | Apropos statements in this line of tradition, the Gemara adds: <b>And Rabbi Aḥa</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, called Jacob El,</b> meaning God? <b>As it is stated:</b> “And he erected there an altar, <b>and he called it El, God of Israel”</b> (Genesis 33:20). It is also possible to translate this as: And He, i.e., the God of Israel, called him, Jacob, El. Indeed, it must be understood this way, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse should be understood as saying that <b>Jacob called the altar El, it should have</b> specified the subject of the verb and written: <b>And Jacob called it</b> El. <b>But</b> since the verse is not written this way, the verse must be understood as follows: <b>He called Jacob El; and who called him El? The God of Israel.</b> |
| Genesis 34:2 | beheld her; | Horayot 10b:11 | He explains: <b>“And Lot cast</b> his eyes” is an allusion to the verse: <b>“His master’s wife cast her eyes</b> upon Joseph and said: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:7). <b>“His eyes”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Samson said: Get her for me, as she is pleasing to my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). <b>“And beheld”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Shechem, son of Hamor,</b> the prince of the land, <b>beheld her;</b> and he took her and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). <b>“The entire plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“For on account of a prostitute a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). <b>“That it was well watered [<i>mashke</i>] everywhere”</b> is an allusion to the verse <b>“I will follow my lovers, givers of my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink [<i>veshikkuyai</i>]”</b> (Hosea 2:7). |
| Genesis 34:2 | “And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her | Nazir 23a:17 | Rabbi Yoḥanan continues to interpret the verse as a series of references to licentiousness. The phrase <b>“and saw”</b> is reminiscent of the verse dealing with Jacob’s daughter Dinah: <b>“And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her</b> and he took her, and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). The verse continues: <b>“All the plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan,”</b> which alludes to the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). The last part of the verse: <b>“That it was well watered everywhere,”</b> recalls: <b>“I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink”</b> (Hosea 2:7). |
| Genesis 34:2 | saw her, | Sanhedrin 70a:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>The one who says</b> that Ham <b>castrated</b> Noah adduces the following proof: <b>Since he injured</b> Noah <b>with</b> respect to the possibility of conceiving <b>a fourth</b> son, which Noah wanted but could no longer have, therefore Noah <b>cursed him by means of</b> Ham’s <b>fourth son.</b> Ham’s sons were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan (see Genesis 10:6), and of all of these, it was Canaan whom Noah cursed (see Genesis 9:25–28). <b>And the one who says</b> that Ham <b>sodomized</b> Noah <b>learned</b> this from a verbal analogy between the words <b>“and he saw”</b> and <b>“and he saw.” Here it is written: “And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father”; and there it is written: “And Shechem, son of Hamor</b> the Hivite, prince of the country, <b>saw her,</b> and he took her, and lay with her, and afflicted her” (Genesis 34:2). This indicates that the term “saw” alludes to sexual intercourse. |
| Genesis 34:2 | and he lay with her and afflicted her” | Yoma 77b:3 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But conjugal relations themselves are called affliction, as it is written:</b> “And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, <b>and he lay with her and afflicted her”</b> (Genesis 34:2). If so, how can it be said that the affliction is in withholding conjugal relations? <b>He said to him: There,</b> Shechem <b>afflicted her from different relations,</b> meaning he slept with her in an unnatural way. That type of relations is clearly an affliction. |
| Genesis 34:7 | “He has done a loathsome act in Israel” | Bava Batra15b:7 | <b>Rabbi Natan says: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of the kingdom of Sheba, as it is stated: “And Sheba fell upon them, and took them away”</b> (Job 1:15). <b>And the Rabbis say: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of</b> the kingdom of <b>the Chaldeans</b> in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>as it is stated: “The Chaldeans formed three bands”</b> (Job 1:17). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Job</b> lived <b>in the days of Jacob and</b> that <b>he married Dina, the daughter of Jacob.</b> As <b>it is written here: “You speak as one of the loathsome women speaks”</b> (Job 2:10), <b>and it is written there</b> in the account of the incident involving Dina: <b>“He has done a loathsome act in Israel”</b> (Genesis 34:7). This concludes the text of the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>And all</b> these <b><i>tanna’im</i> hold that Job was a Jew except for</b> the opinion introduced with the phrase: <b>And some say,</b> according to which Job lived in the time of Jacob, and he was certainly not one of Jacob’s sons. |
| Genesis 34:25 | as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain” | Nedarim 31b:14 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Heaven forbid that Moses our teacher was neglectful of the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision. Rather, this</b> is what <b>he said:</b> If <b>I circumcise</b> the child now <b>and depart</b> to begin my journey, it <b>is a danger</b> for the child, <b>as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25), which indicates that the pain of circumcision lasts for several days and the child may be in danger while in pain. If <b>I circumcise</b> him immediately <b>and wait three days</b> and only then embark on the journey, this is problematic, as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to me: “Go, return into Egypt”</b> (Exodus 4:19), i.e., go immediately. For these reasons Moses did not circumcise the child immediately, but no neglect existed on his part. <b>But</b> according to this explanation, <b>for what reason was Moses punished?</b> |
| Genesis 34:25 | “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain” | Shabbat 134b:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may wash the baby</b> on Shabbat, <b>both before the circumcision and after the circumcision. And one may sprinkle</b> hot water <b>on him by hand but not with a vessel,</b> in order to depart from the usual manner in which this is done. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may wash the baby on the third day</b> following his circumcision, even if <b>that</b> third day <b>occurs on Shabbat.</b> On the third day following circumcision, the baby is considered to be in danger, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the men of Shekhem, who were circumcised: <b>“And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). This teaches us that on the third day the pain of circumcision poses a danger. |
| Genesis 34:25 | it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain” | Shabbat 86a:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the third day</b> after relations <b>is ritually impure,</b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days,</b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the third day,</b> meaning the third day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The mishna cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water. |
| Genesis 35:3 | “To God Who answers [ haoneh ] me in the day of my distress” | Sanhedrin 38b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any place</b> in the Bible from <b>where the heretics</b> attempt to <b>prove their heresy,</b> i.e., that there is more than one god, <b>the response to their</b> claim is <b>alongside them,</b> i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the verses they cite. The verse states that God said: <b>“Let us make man in our image”</b> (Genesis 1:26), employing the plural, <b>but it</b> then <b>states: “And God created man in His image”</b> (Genesis 1:27), employing the singular. The verse states that God said: <b>“Come, let us go down and there confound their language”</b> (Genesis 11:7), but it also states: <b>“And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower”</b> (Genesis 11:5). The verse states in the plural: <b>“There God was revealed [<i>niglu</i>] to him</b> when he fled from the face of his brother” (Genesis 35:7), but it also states in the singular: <b>“To God Who answers [<i>haoneh</i>] me in the day of my distress”</b> (Genesis 35:3). |
| Genesis 35:7 | “There God was revealed [ niglu ] to him | Sanhedrin 38b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any place</b> in the Bible from <b>where the heretics</b> attempt to <b>prove their heresy,</b> i.e., that there is more than one god, <b>the response to their</b> claim is <b>alongside them,</b> i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the verses they cite.

| Genesis 35:10 | “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob; rather, Israel will be your name” | Berakhot 12b:28 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say:</b> The meaning of the expressions: It will not say, and they will no longer mention, are not absolute, as in the verse: <b>“Your name shall no longer be called Jacob; rather, Israel will be your name”</b> (Genesis 35:10).

| Genesis 35:10 | after the incident, | Chullin 101b:9 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> to this <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; <b>and the children of Israel carried Jacob their father,</b> and their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him” (Genesis 46:5). This occurred before the Torah was given at Sinai, and therefore proves that the title “the children of Israel” was in use before the Torah was given. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, this occurred <b>after the incident,</b> i.e., after Jacob wrestled with the angel and after the prophetic vision in which God changed Jacob’s name to Israel (Genesis 35:10). |
| Genesis 35:11 | I am God Almighty, be fruitful and multiply [ perei urvei ]” | Yevamot 65b:5 | The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>On the contrary,</b> the plural term: <b>“And conquer it [<i>vekhivshuha</i>],” indicates</b> that the <b>two</b> of them are included. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is written</b> in the Torah without the letter <i>vav</i>, so that it can be read: <b>And conquer it [<i>vekhivsha</i>],</b> in the singular. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The proof is <b>from here:</b> “And God said to him: <b>I am God Almighty, be fruitful and multiply [<i>perei urvei</i>]”</b> (Genesis 35:11), which is in singular, <b>and it does not state: Be fruitful and multiply [<i>peru urvu</i>]</b> in the plural. |
| Genesis 35:18 | As it is written: “But his father called him Benjamin” | Sotah 36b:9 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this: We require</b> the names to be written <b>“according to their birth,”</b> and Joseph was not called <i>Yehosef</i> from birth. <b>Rather,</b> the explanation is as follows: Throughout <b>the entire Torah,</b> the name of <b>Benjamin is written</b> without a second letter <i>yod</i> between the letters <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i>, <b>and here,</b> where he is born, <b>Benjamin</b> is written <b>in full,</b> spelled with a second <i>yod</i>. <b>As it is written: “But his father called him Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 35:18). Therefore, his name was written on the ephod with a second <i>yod</i>, “according to his birth.” |
| Genesis 35:22 | The incident of Reuben, | Megillah 25a:16 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The incident of Reuben,</b> about which it says: “And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine” (Genesis 35:22), <b>is read</b> from the Torah in public <b>but not translated,</b> so that the uneducated not come to denigrate Reuben. <b>The incident of Tamar</b> (Genesis, chapter 38) <b>is read</b> in public <b>and</b> also <b>translated. The first</b> report of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf,</b> i.e., the Torah’s account of the incident itself (Exodus 32:1–20), <b>is read and translated, but the second</b> narrative, i.e., Aaron’s report to Moses of what had taken place (Exodus 32:21–24) <b>is read but not translated.</b> The verses constituting <b>the Priestly Benediction</b> (Numbers 6:24–26) <b>and the incident of David and Amnon</b> (II Samuel, chapter 13) are <b>read, but not translated.</b> |
| Genesis 35:22 | Kavul, and the sexton of the synagogue was reading: “And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt | Megillah 25b:10 | The <i>Tosefta</i> also states: <b>And these</b> sections are <b>read but are not translated.</b> The acrostic composed of the letters <b><i>reish</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sections included in this category, as the Gemara will explain. The <i>Tosefta</i> states that <b>the incident of Reuben is read but not translated.</b> The name Reuben begins with a <i>reish</i>, the first letter of the mnemonic. And there was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, who went to</b> the village of <b>Kavul, and the sexton of the synagogue was reading: “And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt</b> in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it” (Genesis 35:22). Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to the translator: Stop, translate only the end</b> of the verse. <b>And the Sages praised him</b> for this. |
| Genesis 35:22 | Now the sons of Jacob were twelve” | Shabbat 55b:6 | Having mentioned the sins of some of the significant ancestors of the Jewish people, the Gemara now addresses several additional ancestors. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who says that Reuben sinned</b> with Bilhah <b>is nothing other than mistaken, as it is stated:</b> “And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. <b>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve”</b> (Genesis 35:22). The fact that the Torah stated the number of Jacob’s sons at that point in the narrative <b>teaches that,</b> even after the incident involving Bilhah, <b>all</b> of the brothers <b>were equal</b> in righteousness. Apparently, Reuben did not sin. <b>How</b> then <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And he lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine”?</b> The plain understanding of the verse indicates sin. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches that</b> Reuben <b>rearranged his father’s bed</b> in protest of Jacob’s placement of his bed in the tent of Bilhah and not in the tent of his mother Leah after the death of Rachel. <b>And the verse ascribes to him</b> liability for his action <b>as if he had</b> actually <b>lain with</b> Bilhah. |
| Genesis 35:27 | Kiryat Ha’Arba, | Eruvin 53a:6 | Rather, it is called Machpelah in the sense <b>that it is doubled with</b> the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, who are buried there <b>in pairs.</b> This is similar to the homiletic interpretation of the alternative name for Hebron mentioned in the Torah: <b>“Mamre</b> of <b>Kiryat Ha’Arba,</b> which is Hebron” (Genesis 35:27). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The city is called Kiryat Ha’Arba, the city of four, because it is <b>the city of the four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca,</b> and <b>Jacob and Leah.</b> |
| Genesis 35:27 | Mamre, to Kiryat Arba, the same is Hebron, | Sotah 13a:7 | <b>Once they reached the Cave of Machpelah, Esau came and was preventing them</b> from burying Jacob there. <b>He said to them:</b> It says: “And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to <b>Mamre, to Kiryat Arba, the same is Hebron,</b> where Abraham and Isaac sojourned” (Genesis 35:27). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> It is called <b>Kiryat Arba</b> because there <b>were four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah.</b> Esau said: Jacob <b>buried Leah in his</b> spot, <b>and the</b> spot <b>that is remaining is mine.</b> |
| Genesis 35:29 | said to him: Yes. | Bava Batra16b:15 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Ishmael repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime? From</b> the incident involving <b>Ravina and Rav Ḥama bar Buzi,</b> who <b>were sitting before Rava, and Rava was dozing</b> while they were talking. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ḥama bar Buzi: Is it true that you say</b> that <b>any death with regard to which</b> the word <b><i>gevia</i>,</b> expire, is mentioned <b>is the death of the righteous?</b> Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: Yes.</b> For example: “And Isaac expired [<i>vayyigva</i>], and died” (Genesis 35:29). Ravina objected: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the generation of the flood</b> it states: “And all flesh expired [<i>vayyigva</i>]” (Genesis 7:21), and there they died for their wickedness. Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: We say</b> this only when both <b><i>gevia</i> and <i>asifa</i>,</b> gathering, are used; when these two terms are mentioned together they indicate the death of a righteous person. |
| Genesis 35:29 | “And Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him” | Bava Batra16b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse <b>listed them in the order of their wisdom;</b> that is to say, perhaps in fact Ishmael preceded Isaac but the Torah did not list them in that order. The Gemara answers: <b>But if that is so,</b> consider that the verse states: <b>“And Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him”</b> (Genesis 35:29). <b>What is the reason</b> that the verse there <b>did not list them in the order of their wisdom? Rather, since</b> Ishmael <b>allowed</b> Isaac <b>to precede him,</b> it is clear that he <b>made</b> Isaac <b>his leader, and since he made him his leader, learn from it that he repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime.</b> |
| Genesis 36:12 | “And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, | Sanhedrin 99b:5 | Manasseh <b>said: But did Moses need to write only</b> insignificant matters that teach nothing, for example: <b>“And Lotan’s sister was Timna”</b> (Genesis 36:22), or: <b>“And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz,</b> son of Esau” (Genesis 36:12), or: <b>“And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest and found <i>duda’im</i> in the field”</b> (Genesis 30:14)? <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.

| Genesis 36:20 | recited this verse about him: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah” | Bava Batra115b:4 | Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>recited this verse about him: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:20), <b>and it is written: “And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:24). The first verse portrays Zibeon and Anah as brothers, while the second states that they are father and son. <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Zibeon engaged in sexual intercourse with his mother and begot Anah,</b> so that he was both Anah’s father and his brother. From the fact that the first verse equates Zibeon and Anah by referring to both of them as Seir’s sons despite Anah being a grandson of Seir, it is clear that grandchildren are equal to children, contrary to the Sadducees’ assertion. |
| Genesis 36:20 | into the world, as it is stated: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite, | Pesachim 54a:15 | <b>The interpreters</b> of Torah <b>symbolism [<i>ḥamurot</i>] would say: Anah was</b> the product of an incestuous relationship, and as a result he was spiritually <b>unfit</b> to produce offspring. <b>Therefore,</b> he <b>brought</b> an example of <b>unfitness,</b> i.e., an animal physically unfit to produce offspring, <b>into the world, as it is stated: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite,</b> the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Shoval, and Zibeon, and Anah” (Genesis 36:20). <b>And it is</b> also <b>stated: “And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:24). One verse describes both Anah and Zibeon as sons of Seir, meaning that they are brothers, while the other verse describes Anah as Zibeon’s son. <b>Rather, this teaches that Zibeon cohabited with his mother,</b> the wife of Seir, <b>and fathered Anah from her.</b> He is called Seir’s son although in fact he was the offspring of Seir’s son and Seir’s wife. |
| Genesis 36:20 | which was written: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabit the land, | Shabbat 85a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> when <b>the Sages</b> have <b>an accepted</b> tradition it <b>is a</b> substantial <b>matter,</b> meaning that the tradition is reliable? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You shall not cross your neighbor’s border, which they of the old times have set</b> in your inheritance that you shall inherit” (Deuteronomy 19:14)? It means that <b>you shall not cross the border that the early</b> generations <b>set,</b> establishing the parameters necessary for each plant. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>The early</b> generations <b>set?

| Genesis 36:24 | state: “This is Anah” | Bava Batra115b:5 | The Gemara interrupts the recounting of the <i>baraita</i> and questions Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s inference: <b>But perhaps there were two</b> people named <b>Anah,</b> so that one Anah was Zibeon’s son, and the other his brother? <b>Rabba said: I will state a matter</b> that even <b>King Shapur did not state.

| Genesis 36:24 | this is Anah who found the mules in the wilderness, | Pesachim 54a:14 | <b>Rather, the void</b> of Gehenna was created <b>before the world was created, and its fire</b> was created only <b>on the second day of the week.

| Genesis 36:43 | “This is [ hu ] Esau” | Megillah 11a:17 | The Gemara continues: <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1); the term <i>hu</i>, this is, comes to teach that <b>he</b> remained as he was <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end.</b> Similarly, wherever the words “this is” appear in this manner, the verse indicates that the individual under discussion remained the same from beginning to end, for example: <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Esau”</b> (Genesis 36:43); <b>he</b> remained <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end. “This is [<i>hu</i>] Dathan and Abiram”</b> (Numbers 26:9); <b>they</b> remained <b>in their wickedness from beginning to end. “This is [<i>hu</i>] the king Ahaz”</b> (II Chronicles 28:22); <b>he</b> remained <b>in his wickedness from beginning to end.</b> |

It is stated: <b>“And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan”</b> (Genesis 37:1), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And Joseph brought evil report of them to his father”</b> (Genesis 37:2), which led to the sale of Joseph. <b>And it is stated: “And Israel dwelt</b> in the land of Egypt <b>in the land of Goshen”</b> (Genesis 47:27), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the time drew near that Israel was to die”</b> (Genesis 47:29). It is stated: <b>“And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree”</b> (I Kings 5:5), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom”</b> (I Kings 11:14). |
| Genesis 37:2 | firstborn to emerge from Rachel, as it is written: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph” | Bava Batra123a:13 | <b>Rather, doesn’t your teacher Rabbi Yonatan say like this: It was appropriate for</b> the child receiving the status of <b>firstborn to emerge from Rachel, as it is written: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2), indicating that Joseph was Jacob’s primary progeny. <b>But Leah advanced</b> ahead of Rachel <b>with</b> appeals for <b>mercy,</b> i.e., with prayer, and thereby earned the status as firstborn for her firstborn. <b>But because of</b> the <b>modesty that Rachel possessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, returned</b> the status as firstborn <b>to her.</b> This is why Jacob gave the status as firstborn to Joseph. |
| Genesis 37:2 | “These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, | Berakhot 55b:2 | From the same source, <b>Rabbi Levi said: One should always anticipate</b> fulfillment of a <b>good dream up to twenty-two years</b> after the dream. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Joseph, as it is written</b> in the story of Joseph’s dream: <b>“These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,</b> was feeding the flock with his brethren” (Genesis 37:2); <b>and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh</b> King of Egypt” (Genesis 41:46). <b>From seventeen to thirty how many</b> years <b>are they? Thirteen; and</b> add <b>seven years of plenty and two of famine;</b> the total is <b>twenty-two</b> and only then was the dream fulfilled when his brothers came and bowed down to him. |
| Genesis 37:2 | “And Joseph brought evil report of them to his father” | Sanhedrin 106a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everywhere that it is stated: And he dwelt, it is nothing other than an expression of pain,</b> of an impending calamity, <b>as it is stated: “And Israel dwelt in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab”</b> (Numbers 25:1). It is stated: <b>“And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan”</b> (Genesis 37:1), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And Joseph brought evil report of them to his father”</b> (Genesis 37:2), which led to the sale of Joseph. <b>And it is stated: “And Israel dwelt</b> in the land of Egypt <b>in the land of Goshen”</b> (Genesis 47:27), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the time drew near that Israel was to die”</b> (Genesis 47:29). It is stated: <b>“And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree”</b> (I Kings 5:5), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom”</b> (I Kings 11:14). |
| Genesis 37:2 | descended from his father Jacob, as it is stated: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph” | Sotah 36b:16 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joseph was deserving of having twelve tribes descend from him,</b> the same <b>as</b> twelve tribes <b>descended from his father Jacob, as it is stated: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2). This implies that everything that happened to Jacob was destined to happen to Joseph. <b>However,</b> he did not merit this because <b>his semen was emitted from between his fingernails. And even so,</b> the offspring that were meant to descend from him <b>descended from his brother Benjamin,</b> who had ten sons. <b>And they were all named after</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel,</b> Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard” (Genesis 46:21). |
| Genesis 37:10 | “Shall we, I and your mother and your brothers, come and bow down [ lehishtaḥavot ] to you to the ground?” | Berakhot 34b:3 | Having mentioned Solomon bowing, the Gemara distinguishes between various types of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> means bowing <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with his face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as</b> regarding Solomon <b>it is stated:</b> He finished praying and <b>“he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees.”</b> Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with <b>one’s hands and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> in Jacob’s question to Joseph in response to his dream: <b>“Shall we, I and your mother and your brothers, come and bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10). |
| Genesis 37:10 | “Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [ lehishtaḥavot ] to you to the ground?” | Megillah 22b:16 | Apropos Rav’s practice of prostrating himself, the Gemara continues with a discussion of different forms of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> indicates falling <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with one’s face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as it is stated</b> with regard to Solomon: He finished praying and “he rose from before the altar of the Lord, <b>from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees”</b> (I Kings 8:54). Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with one’s <b>arms and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> that Jacob asked, in response to Joseph’s dream: <b>“Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10). |
| Genesis 37:10 | “Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [ lehishtaḥavot ] to you to the ground” | Shevuot 16b:9 | The Gemara discusses the different forms of bowing in greater detail. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> indicates falling <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikkod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means descending <b>upon</b> one’s <b>knees, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to Solomon: “He rose from before the altar of the Lord, <b>from kneeling [<i>mikero’a</i>] upon his knees”</b> (I Kings 8:54). <b><i>Hishtaḥava’a</i>, this</b> is prostrating oneself while <b>spreading </b>one’s <b>arms and legs</b> in total submission, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that Jacob asked, in response to Joseph’s relating of his dream: <b>“Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground”</b> (Genesis 37:10), i.e., spread out completely on the ground. |
| Genesis 37:14 | Go now, see whether it is well with you brothers and well | Chullin 91b:3 | <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the source is <b>from here,</b> the verse that describes when Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers: “And he said to him: <b>Go now, see whether it is well with you brothers and well</b> with the flock; and bring me back word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem” (Genesis 37:14). The verse indicates that Jacob sent Joseph at a time when he could see his brothers, i.e., during the day. This shows that a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night. |
| Genesis 37:14 | “And he sent him from the valley [ emek ] of Hebron” | Sotah 11a:1 | This is <b>as it is written</b> there: “Thus said the Lord: <b>Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house”</b> (II Samuel 12:11), and this prophecy was fulfilled through Absalom. <b>Similarly, you can say</b> about Joseph, who was sent by his father to inquire as to the well-being of his brothers, where the verse states: <b>“And he sent him from the valley [<i>emek</i>] of Hebron”</b> (Genesis 37:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: From the deep [<i>amukka</i>] counsel of that righteous individual who is interred in Hebron,</b> i.e., Abraham, <b>as it is written:</b> “And He said unto Abram: <b>Know that your seed shall be a stranger</b> in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13). The journey Joseph took to his brothers set in motion the descent of the Jewish people to Egypt. |
| Genesis 37:16 | where [ eifo ] are they feeding their flocks?” | Bava Batra15a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16). |
| Genesis 37:21 | “And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands, | Berakhot 7b:8 | <b>While my son,</b> Reuben, <b>even though Joseph took his birthright from him by force, as it is written:</b> “And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; <b>but, since he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph,</b> son of Israel” (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>Nevertheless, he was not jealous of him, as it is written</b> when Joseph’s brothers sought to kill him: <b>“And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands,</b> saying ‘Let us not take his life’” (Genesis 37:21). |
| Genesis 37:21 | first, as it is stated: “And Reuben heard and delivered him from their hands” | Makkot 10a:14 | § <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: For what</b> reason <b>was Reuben privileged to be enumerated first in the rescue,</b> as the first city of refuge listed is Bezer (see Deuteronomy 4:43), which is located in the tribal portion of Reuben? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he began the rescue</b> of Joseph <b>first, as it is stated: “And Reuben heard and delivered him from their hands”</b> (Genesis 37:21). |
| Genesis 37:24 | and the pit was empty, there was no water in it” | Chagigah 3a:14 | The Gemara cites another statement of Rabbi Tanḥum. <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Natan bar Manyumi taught in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> with regard to Joseph: “And they took him, and cast him into the pit; <b>and the pit was empty, there was no water in it”</b> (Genesis 37:24). <b>By inference from that which is stated: “And the pit was empty,” don’t I know that there was no water in it? Rather,</b> this teaches that <b>there was no water in it, but there were snakes and scorpions in it.</b> |
| Genesis 37:24 | and the pit was empty, there was no water in it” | Shabbat 22a:1 | <b>A Hanukkah lamp that one placed above twenty cubits is invalid, just as</b> a <b><i>sukka</i></b> whose roofing is more than twenty cubits high, <b>and just as an alleyway</b> whose beam, its symbolic fourth partition in order to place an <i>eiruv</i>, is more than twenty cubits high, are invalid. The reason is the same in all three cases: People do not usually raise their heads and see objects at a height above twenty cubits. As there is a requirement to see all of these, they are deemed invalid when placed above that height. <b>And</b> the Gemara cites another statement that <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rav Natan bar Manyumi taught in the name</b> of <b>Rav Tanḥum: What</b> is the meaning of the verse <b>that is written</b> with regard to Joseph: “And they took him, and cast him into the pit; <b>and the pit was empty, there was no water in it”</b> (Genesis 37:24)? <b>By inference from that which is stated: And the pit was empty, don’t I know that there was no water in it? Rather, why does the verse say: There was no water in it?</b> The verse comes to emphasize and teach that <b>there was no water in it, but there were snakes and scorpions in it.</b> |
| Genesis 37:31 | “And they killed a goat, and dipped the coat [ ketonet ] in the blood” | Arakhin 16a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Doesn’t Rabbi Anani bar Sason say: Why</b> was the <b>passage</b> in the Torah that discusses the <b>priestly vestments</b> (Leviticus 8) <b>juxtaposed to</b> the <b>passage</b> that discusses <b>offerings</b> (Leviticus, chapters 1–7)? <b>To tell you</b> that <b>just as offerings atone, so too the priestly vestments atone.</b> For what does each garment atone? The <b>tunic [<i>ketonet</i>] atones for bloodshed, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers after they plotted to kill him: <b>“And they killed a goat, and dipped the coat [<i>ketonet</i>] in the blood”</b> (Genesis 37:31). The <b>trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”</b> (Exodus 28:42). |
| Genesis 37:31 | “And they killed a goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood” | Zevachim 88b:6 | The <b>tunic atones for bloodshed, as it is stated</b> with regard to the brothers of Joseph after they plotted to kill him: <b>“And they killed a goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood”</b> (Genesis 37:31). The <b>trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, as it is stated</b> with regard to fashioning the priestly vestments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”</b> (Exodus 28:42). The <b>mitre atones for the arrogant. From where</b> is this derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item</b> that is placed <b>at an elevation,</b> i.e., on the head of a priest, <b>shall come and atone for</b> the sin of <b>an elevated</b> heart. |
| Genesis 37:32 | Discern now whether it is your son’s coat | Sotah 10b:7 | The verse continues: “And she said: <b>Discern, please,</b> whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff” (Genesis 38:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: With</b> use of the word <b>discern</b> Judah <b>informed his father</b> that Joseph was lost, and also <b>with</b> use of the word <b>discern they informed</b> Judah about the signs. The Gemara explains: <b>With</b> the word <b>discern he informed</b> Jacob his father when he brought him the coat of Joseph and said to his father: “And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said: This have we found. <b>Discern now whether it is your son’s coat</b> or not” (Genesis 37:32). <b>With</b> the word <b>discern they informed him:</b> “And she said: <b>Discern, please, whose are</b> these.” |
| Genesis 37:36 | as it is stated: “And the Midianites sold him into Egypt | Sotah 43a:2 | A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> It was <b>not for nothing</b> that specifically <b>Pinehas went to war</b> with Midian; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>to exact</b> the rightful <b>judgment of his mother’s father,</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the Midianites sold him into Egypt</b> to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s” (Genesis 37:36). The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Pinehas came,</b> on his mother’s side, <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took himself a wife from the daughters of Putiel;</b> and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <b>What, is it not that</b> Pinehas <b>came from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, who</b> was also called Putiel because he <b>fattened [<i>pittem</i>] calves for idol worship?</b> They answer: <b>No;</b> he was descended <b>from Joseph, who mocked [<i>pitpet</i>] his desire</b> by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife. |
| Genesis 38:1 | “And it came to pass at that time, and Judah descended from his brothers” | Sanhedrin 102a:5 | The verse states: <b>“At the time of their punishment, they shall perish”</b> (Jeremiah 51:18). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at the time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“In an acceptable time have I answered you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “in an acceptable time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for good.</b> The verse states: <b>“On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them”</b> (Exodus 32:34). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “on the day when I punish” indicates that <b>it is a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass at that time, and Judah descended from his brothers”</b> (Genesis 38:1). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at that time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> |
| Genesis 38:1 | greatness, as it is written: “And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down [ vayyered ] | Sotah 13b:7 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> with regard to one who initiates performance of a mitzva but does not complete it when capable of doing so: <b>He is also demoted [<i>moridin</i>] from his</b> position of <b>greatness, as it is written: “And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down [<i>vayyered</i>]</b> from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah” (Genesis 38:1). Usage of the term “went down” indicates that the rest of Judah’s brothers had demoted him from his position of greatness because he began the process of saving Joseph, but he did not complete it. |
| Genesis 38:2 | that a merchant can be called a kena’ani ? As it is written: “And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain kena’ani … | Pesachim 50a:15 | <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that a merchant can be called a <i>kena’ani</i>? As it is written: “And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain <i>kena’ani</i>…</b>and he took her, and went in unto her” (Genesis 38:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>kena’ani</i></b> in this context? <b>If you say</b> it refers to <b>an actual Canaanite, is it possible that Abraham warned Isaac</b> not to marry a Canaanite woman, and <b>Isaac warned Jacob</b> to the same effect, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>Judah went and married</b> a Canaanite woman? <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> She was <b>the daughter of a merchant, as it is written: “As for the merchant [<i>kena’an</i>], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves</b> to oppress” (Hosea 12:8). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this meaning of the word can be understood from the following verse, which describes Tyre: <b>“Whose traders are princes, whose merchants [<i>kinaneha</i>] are the honorable of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 23:8). |
| Genesis 38:9 | as it is written: “And it came to pass when he had intercourse with his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground” | Yevamot 34b:3 | The Gemara answers: The <i>Tosefta</i> actually means that what they did was <b>similar to the act of Er and Onan</b> in some ways, but <b>not similar to the act of Er and Onan</b> in other ways. The Gemara elaborates: <b>It was similar to the act of Er and Onan</b> in that there was a spilling of semen, <b>as it is written: “And it came to pass when he had intercourse with his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground”</b> (Genesis 38:9). Yet it was <b>not similar to the act of Er and Onan, as there</b> Er and Onan engaged in sexual intercourse in <b>an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>while here</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring to sexual intercourse <b>in a typical manner.</b> |
| Genesis 38:9 | “That he spilled it on the ground” | Yevamot 34b:4 | The Gemara continues to clarify what took place: <b>Granted, Onan</b> engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with her, <b>as it is written with regard to his</b> act: <b>“That he spilled it on the ground”</b> (Genesis 38:9). <b>However, from where do we</b> derive that <b>Er</b> engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with her? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: As it is written</b> with regard to Onan: <b>“And He slew him also”</b> (Genesis 38:10). This indicates that <b>he, too, died the same death</b> for performing the same transgression as his brother. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Onan</b> engaged in anal intercourse because he did not want Tamar to give birth <b>as</b> “he knew that <b>the seed would not be his”</b> (Genesis 38:9). <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Er, what is the reason he acted</b> in <b>this</b> way? The Gemara responds: He did so in order <b>that she not become pregnant and become less beautiful</b> as a result of her pregnancy. |
| Genesis 38:10 | “And the thing that he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, | Niddah 13b:3 | <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who brings himself into</b> a state of <b>arousal,</b> they <b>do not bring him within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> The proof is that <b>it is written here,</b> with regard to Onan, son of Judah: <b>“And the thing that he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord,</b> and He slew him also” (Genesis 38:10), <b>and it is written there: “For You are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with You.</b> The boasters shall not stand in Your sight…But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness will I come into Your house; I will bow down toward Your holy Temple in fear of You” (Psalms 5:5–8). This demonstrates that whoever does evil, like Onan, shall not sojourn with God. |
| Genesis 38:10 | “And He slew him also” | Yevamot 34b:4 | The Gemara continues to clarify what took place: <b>Granted, Onan</b> engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with her, <b>as it is written with regard to his</b> act: <b>“That he spilled it on the ground”</b> (Genesis 38:9). <b>However, from where do we</b> derive that <b>Er</b> engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with her? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: As it is written</b> with regard to Onan: <b>“And He slew him also”</b> (Genesis 38:10). This indicates that <b>he, too, died the same death</b> for performing the same transgression as his brother. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Onan</b> engaged in anal intercourse because he did not want Tamar to give birth <b>as</b> “he knew that <b>the seed would not be his”</b> (Genesis 38:9). <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Er, what is the reason he acted</b> in <b>this</b> way? The Gemara responds: He did so in order <b>that she not become pregnant and become less beautiful</b> as a result of her pregnancy. |
| Genesis 38:11 | Tamar, | Yevamot 59a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a High Priest: <b>“A widow…he shall not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), which prohibits him from marrying any widow, <b>whether</b> she is <b>a widow from betrothal or a widow from marriage.</b> The Gemara is surprised by this statement: This is <b>obvious,</b> as the verse is referring to a widow without further specification. The Gemara answers: It is necessary; <b>lest you say that one should derive</b> a verbal analogy between the words <b>“widow”</b> and <b>“widow,”</b> based upon the usage of that term in a verse with regard to <b>Tamar,</b> Judah’s daughter-in-law (Genesis 38:11), as follows: <b>Just as there,</b> Tamar was a widow <b>from marriage, so too here</b> the verse is referring only to a widow <b>from marriage.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. |
| Genesis 38:12 | Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died” | Sotah 13b:8 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The episode with regard to Judah also indicates that one who initiates performance of a mitzva but does not complete it will <b>also bury his wife and children</b> as Judah did, <b>as it is written: “And</b> in process of time <b>Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died”</b> (Genesis 38:12), <b>and it is written</b> further: “And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; <b>but Er and Onan died</b> in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 46:12). |
| Genesis 38:13 | Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah | Sotah 10a:16 | § <b>It is written</b> with regard to Samson: <b>“And Samson went down to Timnah,</b> and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines” (Judges 14:1), <b>and it is written</b> in the Torah passage concerning the incident of Judah and Tamar: “And it was told to Tamar, saying: <b>Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah</b> to sheer his sheep” (Genesis 38:13). The verses contain an apparent contradiction as to whether Timnah was a place to which one must descend or a place to which one must ascend. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> These terms do not refer to the manner of traveling to Timnah but are used figuratively. Concerning <b>Samson, who was disgraced there</b> in Timnah, the term indicating <b>descent is written with regard to his</b> journey. Concerning <b>Judah, who was elevated there,</b> the term indicating <b>ascent is written with regard to his</b> journey. |
| Genesis 38:14 | and sat in the entrance of Enaim [ befetaḥ einayim ], | Sotah 10a:19 | The verse states with regard to Tamar: “And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, <b>and sat in the entrance of Enaim [<i>befetaḥ einayim</i>],</b> which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife” (Genesis 38:14). The <i>amora’im</i> dispute the meaning of the word <i>einayim</i>. <b>Rabbi Alexandri says:</b> This <b>teaches that she went and she sat at the entrance</b> of the home <b>of Abraham our forefather, a place that all eyes hope to see it,</b> as she was certain that Judah would pass there. <b>Rabbi Ḥanin</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>a place called Enaim, and similarly</b> the verse <b>states</b> in the list of cities in Eretz Yisrael in the portion of Judah: <b>“Tappuah and Enam”</b> (Joshua 15:34). |
| Genesis 38:15 | From Tamar, as it is written: “When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face” | Megillah 10b:14 | The Gemara responds: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Any bride who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets</b> will <b>emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar, as it is written: “When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). Can it be that <b>because</b> Tamar <b>covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> On the contrary, a harlot tends to uncover her face. |
| Genesis 38:15 | “When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face” | Sotah 10b:2 | The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident of Judah and Tamar. It is written: <b>“When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). The Gemara asks: <b>Because she had covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> Prostitutes usually uncover their faces in order to attract men. |
| Genesis 38:20 | Rabbi Elazar said: The verse states: “And Judah sent the kid of the goats” | Chullin 113a:20 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The verse states: “And Judah sent the kid of the goats”</b> (Genesis 38:20). |
| Genesis 38:24 | And Judah said: Bring her forth, and let her be burned” | Avodah Zarah36b:7 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Licentious</b> sexual intercourse was <b>also</b> prohibited earlier, as <b>they decreed</b> a prohibition in this regard <b>in the court of Shem, as it is written:</b> “It was told to Judah, saying: Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by harlotry. <b>And Judah said: Bring her forth, and let her be burned”</b> (Genesis 38:24). This proves that the prohibition against licentious intercourse with a gentile was in force long before the time of the students of Shammai and Hillel. |
| Genesis 38:24 | an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And it came to pass about three months | Niddah 8b:17 | § The mishna teaches: The time of <b>a pregnant woman</b> is sufficient <b>from</b> the point in her pregnancy when the existence of <b>her fetus is known</b> to all who see her. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> time must pass for <b>the fetus to be known? Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Three months. And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for the matter,</b> that a fetus is discernable after three months of pregnancy, there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And it came to pass about three months</b> after, that it was told to Judah, saying: Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot” (Genesis 38:24). |
| Genesis 38:25 | as it is stated: “As she was brought forth, | Berakhot 43b:8 | <b>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said; and some say Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said; and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is preferable,</b> from an ethical perspective, <b>for one to throw himself into a fiery furnace rather than humiliate another in public. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar,</b> the daughter-in-law of Judah, when she was taken out to be burned, <b>as it is stated: “As she was brought forth,</b> she sent to her father-in-law, saying I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong, and she said examine these, to whom does this seal, cord and staff belong?” (Genesis 38:25). Despite her dire situation, she did not reveal that she was pregnant with Judah’s child; rather, she left the decision to him, to avoid humiliating him in public. |
| Genesis 38:25 | “When she was brought forth [ mutzet ], | Sotah 10b:4 | The verse describes Tamar’s court hearing: <b>“When she was brought forth [<i>mutzet</i>],</b> she sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child” (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>When she was <i>mitutzet</i>.</b> The word <i>mutzet</i> also carries the implication of being found. What then, is taught by the use of that term? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: After her signs,</b> which she was using to prove that she was impregnated by Judah, <b>were brought out,</b> the evil angel <b>Samael came and distanced them</b> from each other in an attempt to prevent Judah’s admission and Tamar’s survival, which would enable the birth of King David. The angel <b>Gabriel</b> then <b>came and moved</b> the signs <b>closer</b> again. Therefore, the word <i>mutzet</i> is used, as it alludes to the signs being found again. |
| Genesis 38:25 | “She sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child” | Sotah 10b:6 | The verse concerning Tamar then states: <b>“She sent to her father-in-law, saying: By the man whose these are, am I with child”</b> (Genesis 38:25). The Gemara comments: <b>And let her say to him</b> explicitly that she was impregnated by him. <b>Rav Zutra bar Tuviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is more amenable for a person to throw himself into a fiery furnace</b> if faced with the choice of publicly embarrassing another or remaining silent even if it leads to being burned, <b>and not humiliate another in public. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar,</b> as she was prepared to be burned if Judah did not confess, rather than humiliate him in public. |
| Genesis 38:25 | Discern, please, | Sotah 10b:7 | The verse continues: “And she said: <b>Discern, please,</b> whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff” (Genesis 38:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: With</b> use of the word <b>discern</b> Judah <b>informed his father</b> that Joseph was lost, and also <b>with</b> use of the word <b>discern they informed</b> Judah about the signs. The Gemara explains: <b>With</b> the word <b>discern he informed</b> Jacob his father when he brought him the coat of Joseph and said to his father: “And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said: This have we found. <b>Discern now whether it is your son’s coat</b> or not” (Genesis 37:32). <b>With</b> the word <b>discern they informed him:</b> “And she said: <b>Discern, please, whose are</b> these.” |
| Genesis 38:26 | “And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I [ mimmenni ]” | Makkot 23b:12 | The Gemara cites a somewhat similar statement. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: In three places the Divine Spirit appeared</b> before all to affirm that the action taken was appropriate: <b>In the court of Shem, in the court of Samuel the Ramathite, and in the court of Solomon.</b> The Gemara elaborates: This occurred <b>in the court of Shem, as it is written</b> in the context of the episode of Judah and Tamar: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I [<i>mimmenni</i>]”</b> (Genesis 38:26). <b>How did</b> Judah <b>know</b> that Tamar’s assertion that she was bearing his child was correct? <b>Perhaps, just as he went to her</b> and hired her as a prostitute, <b>another person went to her</b> and hired her <b>as well,</b> and he is not the father. Rather, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said:</b> It is <b>from Me [<i>mimmenni</i>]</b> that these <b>secrets emerged.</b> God affirmed that her assertion was correct and that it was His divine plan that Judah would father a child from Tamar. |
| Genesis 38:26 | “And Judah acknowledged them, and said: She is more righteous than I; | Sotah 10b:9 | The verse states: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them, and said: She is more righteous than I;</b> forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son” (Genesis 38:26). <b>This is</b> the same <b>as Rav Ḥanin bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private</b> by not committing adultery with the wife of Potiphar, <b>merited that one letter from the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, was added to his</b> name, <b>as it is written: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>bihosef</i> ] for a testimony in his name,</b> when He went forth against the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6). In this verse the name Joseph is written with an additional letter <i>heh</i>, found in the ineffable name of God. |
| Genesis 38:26 | as it is written: “And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I” | Sotah 7b:8 | The Gemara questions the source for Reuben’s admission. <b>Granted, with regard to Judah we have found</b> a source <b>that he admitted</b> his sin with Tamar, <b>as it is written: “And Judah acknowledged them and said: She is more righteous than I”</b> (Genesis 38:26). Judah admitted that he was the one who had impregnated Tamar. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that Reuben admitted</b> his sin? |
| Genesis 39:1 | “And Joseph was brought down to Egypt” | Bava Metzia117a:6 | § The Gemara relates: An incident occurred with <b>these two</b> people <b>who were residing</b> in the same house, <b>one</b> in the <b>upper</b> story, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> in the <b>lower</b> story. The <b>plaster</b> of the floor of the upper story <b>broke,</b> so that <b>when</b> the resident of <b>the upper</b> apartment would <b>wash</b> with <b>water,</b> it would <b>run</b> down <b>and</b> cause <b>damage to the lower</b> story. The question was: <b>Who</b> must <b>repair</b> the ceiling? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: The upper</b> resident <b>repairs</b> it, <b>and Rabbi Elai says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Yosei: The lower</b> resident <b>repairs</b> it. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the following verse can serve as <b>a mnemonic</b> device to remember who issued which ruling: <b>“And Joseph was brought down to Egypt”</b> (Genesis 39:1). Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Yosei, indicated by Joseph, is the Sage who maintains that the owner of the lower story, indicated by: Brought down, must repair the ceiling. |
| Genesis 39:1 | “And Joseph was brought down [ hurad ] to Egypt” | Sotah 13b:11 | After describing that Judah “went down” from his greatness, the Gemara discusses a similar term employed with regard to Joseph, as the verse states: <b>“And Joseph was brought down [<i>hurad</i>] to Egypt”</b> (Genesis 39:1). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Do not read</b> the word as <b>“<i>hurad</i>,”</b> meaning that he was passively brought down, <b>but</b> rather read it as <b><i>horid</i>,</b> meaning: He, Joseph, brought down others, <b>as</b> Joseph <b>brought down the astrologers [<i>itztagninei</i>] of Pharaoh from their</b> position of <b>eminence</b> because he knew the interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams when they did not. |
| Genesis 39:1 | bought him | Sotah 13b:12 | The continuation of that verse states: <b>“And Potiphar, an officer [<i>seris</i>] of Pharaoh’s,</b> the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <b>bought him</b> from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there” (Genesis 39:1). <b>Rav says: He purchased</b> the handsome Joseph <b>for himself,</b> for the intended purpose of homosexual intercourse, but was unable to fulfill his desires, as the angel <b>Gabriel came and castrated</b> Potiphar <b>[<i>seireso</i>].</b> Then <b>Gabriel came</b> again <b>and</b> further <b>mutilated</b> him <b>[<i>fero</i>]</b> in the same part of his body. This is alluded to in the verses that write Potiphar’s name differently: <b>Initially, it is written “Potiphar”</b> (Genesis 39:1) <b>and in the end it is written “Potiphera”</b> (Genesis 41:45). The change in his name indicates that a part of himself was mutilated. |
| Genesis 39:5 | the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph” | Berakhot 42a:8 | <b>Abaye said</b> that on a similar note, <b>we too will say: Immediately</b> following the entrance of <b>Torah scholars</b> into a house, a <b>blessing</b> rests upon that house, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Laban and Jacob: <b>“The Lord has blessed me because of you”</b> (Genesis 30:27). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead, that the proof is <b>from here, as it is stated:</b> “And it was from when he placed him in charge of his house and over all that he owned, <b>the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph”</b> (Genesis 39:5). |
| Genesis 39:5 | is written with regard to Joseph: “The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake” | Sanhedrin 39b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that Ahab <b>said to</b> Obadiah: It <b>is written with regard to Jacob:</b> “And Laban said to him: If now I have found favor in your eyes, <b>I have observed the signs, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake”</b> (Genesis 30:27). It <b>is written with regard to Joseph: “The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake”</b> (Genesis 39:5). <b>The house of that man,</b> i.e., my house, <b>was not blessed. Perhaps you do not fear God?</b> Immediately, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: “Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly,” but the house of Ahab is not fit for blessing</b> like the houses of those masters. |
| Genesis 39:7 | “His master’s wife cast her eyes | Horayot 10b:11 | He explains: <b>“And Lot cast</b> his eyes” is an allusion to the verse: <b>“His master’s wife cast her eyes</b> upon Joseph and said: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:7). <b>“His eyes”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Samson said: Get her for me, as she is pleasing to my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). <b>“And beheld”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Shechem, son of Hamor,</b> the prince of the land, <b>beheld her;</b> and he took her and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). <b>“The entire plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“For on account of a prostitute a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). <b>“That it was well watered [<i>mashke</i>] everywhere”</b> is an allusion to the verse <b>“I will follow my lovers, givers of my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink [<i>veshikkuyai</i>]”</b> (Hosea 2:7). |
| Genesis 39:7 | “That his master’s wife lifted up her eyes” | Nazir 23a:16 | Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>“And Lot lifted up</b> his eyes” employs the same expression as a verse that refers to Joseph’s temptation: <b>“That his master’s wife lifted up her eyes”</b> (Genesis 39:7), which is clearly referring to sin. The phrase used in reference to Lot, <b>“his eyes,”</b> is stated similarly to Samson’s appraisal of the Philistine girl he sought to marry: <b>“For she is pleasing in my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). |
| Genesis 39:9 | “How can I do this great wickedness, | Arakhin 15b:19 | <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations it is written</b> that when Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Joseph he responded: <b>“How can I do this great wickedness,</b> and sin against God” (Genesis 39:9). <b>With regard to bloodshed it is written,</b> after Cain murdered his brother: “And Cain said to the Lord: <b>My punishment is greater than I can bear”</b> (Genesis 4:13). The Torah describes each of these three cardinal sins with the word “great” in the singular, whereas malicious speech is described with the plural term “great things,” indicating that it is equivalent to all three of the other transgressions together. |
| Genesis 39:9 | and sin to God” | Makkot 9a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that based on the formulation of the verse one concludes that it was a sin exclusively vis-à-vis God, where Joseph says to Potiphar’s wife: “And how can I perform this great evil, <b>and sin to God”</b> (Genesis 39:9), may one also infer that it was a sin <b>vis-à-vis God and not vis-à-vis man?</b> Joseph is referring to adultery, which is punishable by execution according to the Noahide laws as well. <b>Rather,</b> in that case it means that although he performed a sin vis-à-vis God, <b>his judgment is given over to</b> the ruling of <b>man; here too,</b> in the verse about Abimelech, it can be explained that although he performed a sin vis-à-vis God, <b>his judgment is given over to</b> the ruling of <b>man.</b> There is no proof from this verse with regard to the status of one who says that it is permitted to perform a transgression. |
| Genesis 39:9 | “And sin against God” | Sanhedrin 109a:10 | <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money; “and sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies. “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money, as it is written: “And your eye is wicked against your poor brother</b> and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>“And sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph and the wife of Potiphar: <b>“And sin against God”</b> (Genesis 39:9). <b>“Before the Lord”; this</b> is referring to <b>blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>God. “Exceedingly [<i>meod</i> ]”</b> is referring to <b>bloodshed, as it is stated: “Moreover Manasseh shed very [<i>meod</i> ] much blood”</b> (II Kings 21:16). |
| Genesis 39:9 | “And how can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God” | Sanhedrin 109a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda says: “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies; “and sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money. “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph and the wife of Potiphar: <b>“And how can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God”</b> (Genesis 39:9). <b>“And sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money, as it is written:</b> “And your eye is wicked against your poor brother, and you give him nothing…<b>for it shall be reckoned to you as a sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>“Before the Lord”; this</b> is referring to <b>blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>God. “Exceedingly”</b> means <b>that they had intent and sinned</b> and did not sin unwittingly or driven by lust. |
| Genesis 39:10 | “And he did not listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her” | Avodah Zarah5a:5 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is tied to him like a dog</b> and does not leave him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Joseph and Potiphar’s wife: <b>“And he did not listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10). This teaches that Joseph refused <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> which would have meant that he would have had <b>“to be with her” in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Genesis 39:10 | “That he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her” | Sotah 3b:14 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is chained to him</b> and accompanies him <b>like a dog, as it is stated</b> concerning Joseph’s refusal to commit adultery with the wife of Potiphar: <b>“That he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10), which is understood to mean: If he would agree <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> the result would be that he would have <b>“to be with her”</b> forever, as the transgression would accompany him <b>to the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Genesis 39:10 | She gave him a thousand talents of silver to submit to her, “to lie with her and be with her” | Yoma 35b:12 | One day <b>she said to him: Submit to me</b> and have relations with me.<br><b>He said to her: No.</b> <br><b>She said to him: I will incarcerate you in the prison. He said to her:</b> I do not fear you, as it is stated: <b>“God releases prisoners”</b> (Psalms 146:7). <br><b>She said to him: I will</b> cause you to be <b>bent over</b> with suffering. <br>He said: <b>“God straightens those who are bent over”</b> (Psalms 146:8). <br>She said <b>I will blind your eyes.</b> <br>He said to her <b>“God opens the eyes of the blind”</b> (Psalms 146:8). <br><b>She gave him a thousand talents of silver to submit to her, “to lie with her and be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10), <b>and he refused.</b> |
| Genesis 39:11 | came into the house to do his labor; | Shabbat 49b:8 | <b>Rav Yosef raised a dilemma:</b> The term his labor is written with regard to Joseph: “And it came to pass about this time, that he <b>came into the house to do his labor;</b> and there was none of the men of the house there within” (Genesis 39:11). <b>Is it</b> included <b>in the count</b> of the thirty-nine instances <b>or not? Abaye said to him: And let us bring a Torah scroll and count</b> the instances of the word labor and thereby determine whether or not there are thirty-nine instances without that one. <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in a case of similar uncertainty: <b>They did not move from there until they brought a Torah scroll and counted them?</b> |
| Genesis 39:11 | As it is written: “And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work” | Sotah 36b:11 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the situation where <b>Joseph</b> sanctified God’s name in private? <b>As it is written: “And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work”</b> (Genesis 39:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that both</b> Joseph and Potiphar’s wife stayed in the house, as they <b>intended to</b> perform <b>a matter of sin.</b> With regard to the phrase <b>“when he went into the house to do his work,” Rav and Shmuel</b> engage in a dispute with regard to its meaning. <b>One says:</b> It means that he went into the house <b>to do his work, literally. And one says: He entered</b> the house <b>in order to fulfill his</b> sexual <b>needs</b> with her. |
| Genesis 39:11 | “And there was none of the men of the house | Sotah 36b:12 | The verse continues: <b>“And there was none of the men of the house</b> there within” (Genesis 39:11). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible</b> that in such <b>a large</b> and important <b>house like the house of that wicked man</b> that <b>no one was in there? The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: That day was their festival day and they all went to their house of idol worship; and she told them</b> that <b>she was sick</b> and could not go, as <b>she said</b> to herself: <b>I have no day on which Joseph will attend to me like this day.</b> |
| Genesis 39:12 | “And she caught him by his garment, saying: | Sotah 36b:13 | The verse states: <b>“And she caught him by his garment, saying:</b> Lie with me” (Genesis 39:12). <b>At that moment his father’s image [<i>deyokeno</i>] came and appeared to him in the window.</b> The image <b>said to him: Joseph,</b> the names of <b>your brothers are destined to be written on the stones of the ephod, and you</b> are to be included <b>among them. Do you desire your name to be erased from among them, and to be called an associate [<i>ro’eh</i>] of promiscuous women? As it is written: “But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his riches”</b> (Proverbs 29:3), as he loses his honor, which is more valuable than wealth. |
| Genesis 40:10 | “And in the vine were three branches [ sarigim ]; | Chullin 92a:5 | Similarly, with regard to the dream of Pharaoh’s butler, the verse states: <b>“And in the vine were three branches [<i>sarigim</i>];</b> and as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes” (Genesis 40:10). <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: These</b> three branches refer to the <b>three proud princes [<i>sarei ge’im</i>] who emerge from the Jewish people in each and every generation.</b> There are <b>times</b> when <b>two are here</b> in Babylonia <b>and one is in Eretz Yisrael,</b> and there are <b>times</b> when <b>two are in Eretz Yisrael and one is here</b> in Babylonia. When this was stated in the study hall, <b>the Sages</b> present <b>turned their eyes toward Rabbana Ukva and Rabbana Neḥemya, the sons of the daughter of Rav,</b> who were from the family of the Exilarch and were two leaders of the generation who resided in Babylonia. |
| Genesis 40:10 | Rabban Gamliel said: | Chullin 92a:9 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> In order to understand this verse (Genesis 40:10) <b>we still need</b> the explanation <b>of</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>HaModa’i, who</b> is an expert in matters of <i>aggada</i>, as he <b>interprets all of</b> the phrases in the verse as referring to <b>one location. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Temple,</b> the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest. “And as it was budding [<i>poraḥat</i>], its blossoms shot forth”; these are the young priests [<i>pirḥei khehunna</i>]. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the</b> wine <b>libations.</b> |
| Genesis 40:16 | “The baker saw | Berakhot 55b:18 | With regard to Joseph’s interpretation of these dreams, the Gemara asks, it is written: <b>“The baker saw</b> that the interpretation was good” (Genesis 40:16); <b>from where did</b> the baker <b>know</b> that the interpretation was good? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that each</b> of them <b>was shown his dream and the interpretation of the other’s dream.</b> That is how he knew that it was the correct interpretation. |
| Genesis 41:1 | two years, as it is written: “And it came to pass at the end of two years of days [ yamim ]” | Nazir 5a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that <i>yamim</i> means <b>two years, as it is written: “And it came to pass at the end of two years of days [<i>yamim</i>]”</b> (Genesis 41:1). The Gemara rejects this: <b>We derive</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>yamim</i></b> in a case <b>where it does not have</b> the term <b>years</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> as in the case of Absalom, <b>from</b> another usage of the term <b><i>yamim</i> that does not have</b> the term <b>years</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., the verse about houses of walled cities. <b>And this</b> usage of the term <i>yamim</i> <b>that does have</b> the term <b>years</b> mentioned <b>with it will not prove</b> otherwise. |
| Genesis 41:12 | “Each man according to his dream he did interpret” | Berakhot 55b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all dreams follow the mouth is a verse</b> cited as corroboration? The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that all dreams follow the mouth</b> of the interpreter? <b>As it is stated</b> in the story of the dreams of Pharaoh’s two ministers. The butler said to Pharaoh: <b>“And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was”</b> (Genesis 41:13). <b>Rava said,</b> one must attach a caveat to this: <b>This is only</b> in a case where <b>it is interpreted for him</b> in a manner <b>akin to the dream,</b> where the interpretation is relevant to the dream, <b>as it is stated</b> in the story of Joseph’s interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh’s two ministers: <b>“Each man according to his dream he did interpret”</b> (Genesis 41:12). |
| Genesis 41:12 | “And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew” | Megillah 13b:8 | The Megilla continues: <b>“In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate,</b> two of the king’s chamberlains, <b>Bigthan and Teresh,</b> of those that guarded the doors, <b>became angry,</b> and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus” (Esther 2:21). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, caused a master to become angry with his servants</b> in order <b>to fulfill the will of a righteous man. And who is this?</b> It is <b>Joseph, as it is stated</b> in the chief butler’s account of how Pharaoh had become angry with him and with the chief baker and sent them to jail: <b>“And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew”</b> (Genesis 41:12). |
| Genesis 41:13 | “And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was” | Berakhot 55b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all dreams follow the mouth is a verse</b> cited as corroboration? The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that all dreams follow the mouth</b> of the interpreter? <b>As it is stated</b> in the story of the dreams of Pharaoh’s two ministers.

| Genesis 41:14 | rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Genesis 41:32 | as it is stated: “And for that the dream was doubled | Berakhot 55b:20 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan also said: Three dreams are fulfilled: A dream of the morning, a dream that one’s fellow dreamed about him, and a dream that is interpreted within a dream. And some say that a dream that is repeated</b> several times is also fulfilled, <b>as it is stated: “And for that the dream was doubled</b> unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass” (Genesis 41:32). |
| Genesis 41:43 | “And they cried before him, Avrekh ” | Bava Batra4a:5 | The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>reikha</i>?</b> It denotes <b>royalty, as it is written: “I am today a tender [<i>rakh</i>] and anointed king”</b> (II Samuel 3:39). <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the meaning of the word is learned <b>from here,</b> from the term describing Joseph after he was appointed viceroy to the king: <b>“And they cried before him, <i>Avrekh</i>”</b> (Genesis 41:43). |
| Genesis 41:44 | Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When Pharaoh said to Joseph: “And without you no man shall lift up his hand | Sotah 36b:19 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When Pharaoh said to Joseph: “And without you no man shall lift up his hand</b> or his foot in all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:44), <b>Pharaoh’s astrologers said: You will appoint a slave whose master bought him for twenty silver</b> coins <b>to rule over us? He said to them: I perceive royal characteristics [<i>ginnunei malkhut</i>] in him</b> and see that he was not initially a slave. |
| Genesis 41:45 | and in the end it is written “Potiphera” | Sotah 13b:12 | The continuation of that verse states: <b>“And Potiphar, an officer [<i>seris</i>] of Pharaoh’s,</b> the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <b>bought him</b> from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there” (Genesis 39:1). <b>Rav says: He purchased</b> the handsome Joseph <b>for himself,</b> for the intended purpose of homosexual intercourse, but was unable to fulfill his desires, as the angel <b>Gabriel came and castrated</b> Potiphar <b>[<i>seireso</i>].</b> Then <b>Gabriel came</b> again <b>and</b> further <b>mutilated</b> him <b>[<i>fero</i>]</b> in the same part of his body. This is alluded to in the verses that write Potiphar’s name differently: <b>Initially, it is written “Potiphar”</b> (Genesis 39:1) <b>and in the end it is written “Potiphera”</b> (Genesis 41:45). The change in his name indicates that a part of himself was mutilated. |
| Genesis 41:46 | and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh | Berakhot 55b:2 | From the same source, <b>Rabbi Levi said: One should always anticipate</b> fulfillment of a <b>good dream up to twenty-two years</b> after the dream. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Joseph, as it is written</b> in the story of Joseph’s dream: <b>“These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,</b> was feeding the flock with his brethren” (Genesis 37:2); <b>and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh</b> King of Egypt” (Genesis 41:46). <b>From seventeen to thirty how many</b> years <b>are they? Thirteen; and</b> add <b>seven years of plenty and two of famine;</b> the total is <b>twenty-two</b> and only then was the dream fulfilled when his brothers came and bowed down to him. |
| Genesis 41:46 | And it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh” | Megillah 17a:3 | If we calculate these <b>sixty-three</b> years <b>and</b> the <b>fourteen until Joseph was born, this</b> means that Jacob should have been <b>seventy-seven</b> at the time of Joseph’s birth. <b>And it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh”</b> (Genesis 41:46). <b>This</b> indicates that Jacob should have then been at least <b>a hundred and seven</b> years old when Joseph was thirty. Add the <b>seven</b> years <b>of plenty and</b> the <b>two of famine,</b> and <b>this</b> would then indicate that Jacob should have been <b>a hundred and sixteen</b> years old when he arrived in Egypt in the second year of the famine. |
| Genesis 41:50 | As it is stated: “And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came” | Taanit 11a:4 | Similarly, <b>Reish Lakish said: It is prohibited for a person to have conjugal relations in years of famine,</b> so that children not be born during these difficult years. <b>As it is stated: “And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came”</b> (Genesis 41:50). It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Nevertheless, <b>those without children may have marital relations in years of famine,</b> as they must strive to fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. |
| Genesis 41:57 | in other lands? The verse states “And all the land came to Egypt | Pesachim 119a:6 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Joseph collected all the silver and gold in the world and brought it to Egypt, as it is stated: “And Joseph collected all the money found</b> in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 47:14). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that he collected the money <b>that</b> was <b>in the land of Egypt and that</b> was <b>in the Land of Canaan. From where</b> do I derive that he also collected all the money <b>that</b> was <b>in other lands? The verse states “And all the land came to Egypt</b> to buy food from Joseph, because the famine was sore in all the earth” (Genesis 41:57). |
| Genesis 42:1 | as it is stated: “And Jacob said to his sons: Why do you show yourselves?” | Taanit 10b:6 | With regard to one who <b>forgot</b> the fast <b>and ate and drank, he should not show himself before the community</b> while satiated, <b>and he should not indulge in luxuries.</b> One should not think that because one has already eaten, his fast is completely nullified, and one may conduct himself as if it were not a fast day at all. Rather, one should minimize one’s eating, <b>as it is stated: “And Jacob said to his sons: Why do you show yourselves?”</b> (Genesis 42:1). <b>Jacob said to his sons: Do not show yourselves when you are satiated, not before</b> the members of the house of <b>Esau, nor before</b> those of <b>Ishmael, so that they not be jealous of you,</b> as they suffer from hunger. This teaches that one should not show he is full when others are hungry. |
| Genesis 42:6 | other than Joseph, as it is stated: “And Joseph was the governor of the land, and he was the provider [ hamashbir ] to all the people of the land” | Sanhedrin 92a:3 | <b>And if one teaches</b> the student <i>halakha</i> rather than withholding it, <b>what is his reward? Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says: He is privileged</b> to receive <b>blessings like Joseph, as it is stated</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“But blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides [<i>mashbir</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And <i>mashbir</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>other than Joseph, as it is stated: “And Joseph was the governor of the land, and he was the provider [<i>hamashbir</i>] to all the people of the land”</b> (Genesis 42:6). |
| Genesis 42:8 | spoke well to you, as it is stated: “And Joseph knew his brothers and they knew him not” | Bava Metzia39b:8 | The case <b>came before Rav Ḥisda. He said to</b> the brother: Mari bar Isak <b>spoke well to you, as it is stated: “And Joseph knew his brothers and they knew him not”</b> (Genesis 42:8). This <b>teaches that</b> Joseph <b>left</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>without the trace of a beard, and he came with the trace of a beard.</b> This proves that it is possible for brothers not to recognize each other. Mari bar Isak may be telling the truth when he claims he does not recognize you. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> the brother: <b>Go bring witnesses that you are his brother.</b> The brother <b>said to him: I have witnesses, but they fear</b> Mari bar Isak <b>because he is a violent man.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Mari bar Isak: <b>You go bring witnesses that he is not your brother.</b> |
| Genesis 42:8 | as it is written: “And Joseph recognized his brothers but they recognized him not” | Ketubot 27b:11 | Proof that one is not suspected of both concealing the truth and lying is cited, <b>as</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>of Mari bar Isak, and some say</b> it was <b>Ḥana bar Isak,</b> where someone claiming to be his <b>brother came to him from Bei Ḥoza’a,</b> a district located far from the Jewish population centers in Babylonia. This brother <b>said to him: Apportion me</b> a share <b>in my father’s property.</b> Mari <b>said to him: I do not know you.</b> The brother <b>came before Rav Ḥisda</b> seeking a legal remedy. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> Your brother <b>is speaking well</b> and his response is well founded, <b>as it is written: “And Joseph recognized his brothers but they recognized him not”</b> (Genesis 42:8). This <b>teaches that</b> Joseph <b>left</b> the land of Canaan <b>without the trace of a beard and came</b> to meet his brothers <b>with the trace of a beard.</b> |
| Genesis 42:8 | as it is written: “And Joseph recognized his brothers but they did not recognize him” | Yevamot 88a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>If we do not know him,</b> even if she married <b>by one witness, why</b> should she <b>leave?</b> The testimony of the witness who says the husband is dead should be accepted. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>when two</b> others <b>came and said: We were with him from when he left until now, and it is you who do not recognize him,</b> as his appearance has changed over the course of time. This is <b>as it is written: “And Joseph recognized his brothers but they did not recognize him”</b> (Genesis 42:8), <b>and Rav Ḥisda said</b> that this verse <b>teaches that</b> Joseph <b>left</b> his brothers <b>without a full beard, and he came with a full beard,</b> which is why they failed to recognize him. This shows that one’s appearance can change so much over time that even his own family members are unable to identify him. |
| Genesis 42:13 | Jacob’s sons. | Bava Batra110b:9 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And paternal brothers inherit</b> from one another <b>and bequeath</b> to each other. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> It <b>is derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word: <b>Brothers,</b> stated with regard to inheritance, and the word: <b>Brothers,</b> found in the verses concerning <b>Jacob’s sons.</b> When Jacob’s sons speak to Joseph, they state: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:13), and in the passage discussing inheritance the verse states: “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10). <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse concerning Jacob’s sons, the word brothers is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers, as the twelve of them shared only the same father, <b>so too here,</b> where this term is used with regard to inheritance, the verse is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers. |
| Genesis 42:13 | brothers, | Yevamot 17b:6 | The Gemara objects on another count: <b>Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>brotherhood</b> from the term <b>brotherhood from Lot, as it is written</b> that Abraham said to Lot: <b>“For we are brothers”</b> (Genesis 13:8). From here one could conclude that the word brothers means relatives and not necessarily brothers. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is</b> more <b>reasonable to derive from the children of Jacob, due to</b> the fact that the word “brothers” <b>is free</b> in its context and is therefore available to be used in a verbal analogy: <b>Since it could have written: We your servants are twelve children of our father,</b> but instead it <b>writes:</b> “Twelve <b>brothers,</b> the children of one man” (Genesis 42:13), <b>learn from here</b> that this comes <b>to render</b> the word “brothers” <b>free</b> so that it may be allocated to another matter, i.e., the definition of brothers. |
| Genesis 42:28 | “And their heart failed them and they turned trembling to one to another, saying: What is this that God has done to us?” | Taanit 9a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan sat down and wondered</b> aloud about this verse, <b>saying: Is there anything that is written in the Writings that is not alluded to in the Torah</b> at all? I cannot think of any hint of this idea in the Torah itself. The child <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that <b>this</b> idea is really <b>not alluded to</b> in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it written,</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers: <b>“And their heart failed them and they turned trembling to one to another, saying: What is this that God has done to us?”</b> (Genesis 42:28). This verse exemplifies the notion that when one sins and encounters troubles, he wonders why it is happening to him. |
| Genesis 42:30 | “The man, the lord of the land, spoke [ dibber ] harshly to us” | Makkot 11a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all</b> instances of <b>speaking [<i>dibbur</i>]</b> indicate <b>harsh language?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers: <b>“The man, the lord of the land, spoke [<i>dibber</i>] harshly to us”</b> (Genesis 42:30). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Then <b>they</b> who feared the Lord <b>spoke [<i>nidberu</i>]</b> with one another” (Malachi 3:16), that the term <b>“they spoke” is nothing other than a term of gentleness, and likewise,</b> the same is true of the verse which <b>states: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] peoples under us”</b> (Psalms 47:4), meaning that God will calmly and gently conduct the nations under the influence of the Jewish people? The Gemara answers: The meaning of <b><i>dibber</i> is discrete</b> and the meaning of <b><i>yadber</i> is discrete.</b> There is a difference between the two conjugations of the same root. |
| Genesis 42:36 | Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away; | Chullin 95b:14 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: But this</b> is provided <b>that</b> the sign <b>has been established</b> by repeating itself <b>three times.</b> This is based on a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And Jacob their father said to them: Me you have bereaved of my children: <b>Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away;</b> upon me are all these things come” (Genesis 42:36). If calamity were to befall Benjamin, that would establish a pattern of three tragedies. |
| Genesis 42:37 | “Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you” | Bava Batra173b:10 | <b>Rav Ḥisda objects to this: This</b> incident involving Benjamin is not a case of a standard guarantor, but a case of <b>an unconditional guarantee, as it is written,</b> also in the context of Benjamin, that Reuben said: <b>“Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you”</b> (Genesis 42:37). One who undertakes unconditional responsibility for a loan has a different status than a standard guarantor, as will soon be elaborated. Therefore, a biblical source has yet to be adduced to teach that one can become a standard guarantor. |
| Genesis 42:38 | harm at the hand of Heaven, | Ketubot 30a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana? Abaye said: It states</b> the word <b>harm at the hands of man,</b> in the verse “But if any harm follow, then you shall give a soul for a soul” (Exodus 21:23) and <b>it states</b> the word <b>harm at the hand of Heaven,</b> in the verse in which Jacob states: “My son shall not descend with you…and harm befalls him on the way” (Genesis 42:38). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>harm that is stated at the hands of man,</b> e.g., one who kills and is liable to be executed, one is <b>exempt from the</b> associated <b>payment, so too,</b> with regard to <b>harm that is stated at the hand of Heaven,</b> one is <b>exempt from the</b> associated <b>payment.</b> |
| Genesis 43:9 | “I will be his guarantor; of my hand shall you request him” | Bava Batra173b:9 | § <b>Rav Huna said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay a loan he has guaranteed? <b>As it is written</b> that Judah reassured his father concerning the young Benjamin: <b>“I will be his guarantor; of my hand shall you request him”</b> (Genesis 43:9). This teaches that it is possible for one to act as a guarantor that an item will be returned to the giver. |
| Genesis 43:9 | “If I do not bring him to you… | Makkot 11b:1 | Apropos declarations that take effect even if they were stated conditionally and the condition was not fulfilled, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ostracism</b> that was declared <b>conditionally requires nullification,</b> even though the condition was not fulfilled. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? It is derived <b>from Judah, as it is written</b> with regard to his request that his father allow the brothers to take Benjamin to Egypt: <b>“If I do not bring him to you…</b>I would have sinned to you for all days” (Genesis 43:9), i.e., I will remain ostracized as a sinner. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let Reuben live and not die”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:6), followed immediately by the verse: <b>“And this for Judah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7)? Why was the blessing of Judah linked to that of Reuben? |
| Genesis 43:11 | “If it must be so now [ eifo ], do this” | Bava Batra15a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16). |
| Genesis 43:16 | “Slaughter [ tevo’aḥ ] and prepare; | Chullin 85a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon, what is the reason</b> he holds that an ineffective slaughter is not considered an act of slaughter? <b>Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said:</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derives</b> his opinion <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“Slaughter [<i>tevo’aḥ</i>] and prepare;</b> for the men shall dine with me at noon” (Genesis 43:16). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse is referring to an act of <b>slaughter</b> that is <b>fit</b> to render the meat permitted, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a mother and its offspring, only an act of <b>slaughter</b> that is <b>fit</b> to render the meat permitted is considered an act of slaughter. |
| Genesis 43:16 | and slaughter the animals, and prepare | Chullin 91a:21 | <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> also <b>said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: Bring the men into the house, <b>and slaughter the animals, and prepare</b> the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon” (Genesis 43:16)? Joseph commanded his steward: <b>Expose the place of the slaughter</b> on the neck of the animal <b>to them</b> so that the brothers will know that it is being slaughtered correctly. <b>“And prepare”</b> teaches that Joseph instructed the steward to <b>remove the sciatic nerve in their presence</b> so that the brothers would know that it had been fully removed. The Gemara comments that this opinion is <b>according to the one who said</b> that <b>the sciatic nerve was forbidden to</b> the children of Jacob even before the Torah was given, when they still had the status of <b>descendants of Noah.</b> |
| Genesis 43:29 | et Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son” | Bava Batra123b:1 | “And he lifted up his eyes, and saw <b><i>et</i> Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son”</b> (Genesis 43:29), which would render the count of seventy incorrect. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said:</b> There <b>was a goodly pearl [<i>margalit</i>] in my hand, and you are trying to have me lose it.</b> He continued: <b>So said Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: This</b> missing seventieth person is <b>Jochebed, whose conception was on the journey,</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born within the walls,</b> i.e., in Egypt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59). <b>Her birth</b> was <b>in Egypt, but her conception</b> was <b>not in Egypt.</b> Accordingly, the family had seventy persons upon arrival, but she could not have been listed as descending to Egypt. |
| Genesis 43:34 | And se’et means nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And he took portions [ masot ] from before him” | Bava Metzia53b:1 | <b>even in Jerusalem,</b> although ritually pure second tithe cannot be desacralized in Jerusalem? It is <b>as it is stated: “For you are unable to carry [<i>se’et</i>] it…</b>and you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:24–25). <b>And <i>se’et</i> means nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And he took portions [<i>masot</i>] from before him”</b> (Genesis 43:34). Since ritually impure second-tithe produce may not be consumed, Rabbi Elazar holds that one may desacralize it even if it had been brought into Jerusalem. |
| Genesis 43:34 | nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And portions [ masot ] were taken to them from before him” | Makkot 19b:9 | It is <b>as Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to second-tithe</b> produce <b>that became impure that</b> one <b>may redeem it even in Jerusalem?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Because you are unable to carry it [<i>se’eto</i>],</b> as the place is too far from you…and you shall turn it into money” (Deuteronomy 14:24–25). <b>And <i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And portions [<i>masot</i>] were taken to them from before him”</b> (Genesis 43:34), referring to gifts of food. Therefore, the phrase: You are unable <i>se’eto</i>, means: You cannot eat it, referring to a case where it is impure. The Torah states that in that case one may redeem the produce even if it is in Jerusalem, not at a distance. |
| Genesis 43:34 | eating, as it is stated: “And portions [ masot ] were taken to them from before him” | Pesachim 36b:5 | <b>And</b> it is derived by means of a verbal analogy that this <b>carrying [<i>se’et</i>] is nothing other</b> than <b>eating, as it is stated: “And portions [<i>masot</i>] were taken to them from before him”</b> (Genesis 43:34). In light of this parallel language, the Gemara understands the phrase “so that you are not able <i>se’eto</i>” to mean: So that you are not able to eat it. Like second-tithe produce that has not yet been taken into Jerusalem, second-tithe produce in the capital that cannot be eaten due to ritual impurity can be redeemed and taken out of the city. Consequently, second tithe can indeed be considered food that may be eaten “in all of your habitations.” |
| Genesis 43:34 | nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And he took portions [ masot ] from before him” | Sanhedrin 112b:15 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And let him redeem it</b> in Jerusalem, <b>as Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to second-tithe</b> produce <b>that became impure, that one may redeem it even in Jerusalem?</b> As <b>the verse states:</b> “And if the way is too long for you <b>so that you are unable to carry it [<i>se’eto</i>]…</b>and you shall turn it into money” (Deuteronomy 14:24–25). <b>And <i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than eating, as it is stated: “And he took portions [<i>masot</i>] from before him”</b> (Genesis 43:34), indicating that second-tithe produce that cannot be eaten, whether due to the distance from Jerusalem or due to its impurity, may be redeemed. The Gemara answers: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> It is not a case where the second-tithe produce became impure; rather, it is a case <b>where</b> an item <b>purchased</b> with second-tithe money became impure. |
| Genesis 43:34 | as it is written: “And they drank and became drunk with him” | Shabbat 139a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Joseph’s brothers <b>too did not sample the taste of wine</b> during the intervening period, due to their remorse, <b>as it is written: “And they drank and became drunk with him”</b> (Genesis 43:34). <b>By inference: Until now there was no drunkenness,</b> as they abstained from drinking. <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Mallai, holds: <b>It was drunkenness</b> of <b>which there was none; however, there was drinking</b> on the part of the brothers during the intervening years. |
| Genesis 44:3 | “As soon as the morning was or , the men were sent away, | Pesachim 2a:3 | To clarify the meaning of the word <i>or</i>, the Gemara analyzes biblical verses and rabbinic statements. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a verse: <b>“As soon as the morning was <i>or</i>, the men were sent away,</b> they and their donkeys” (Genesis 44:3). <b>Apparently, <i>or</i> is day.</b> The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Is it written: The light was morning? “The morning was light” is written.</b> In this context, <i>or</i> is a verb not a noun, <b>as the one who said:</b> The <b>morning lightened. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person</b> should <b>always enter</b> an unfamiliar city <b>with “it is good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), i.e., before sunset, while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to light upon its creation. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he</b> should <b>leave with “it is good,”</b> meaning after sunrise the next morning. |
| Genesis 44:3 | as it is stated: “As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away” | Taanit 10b:11 | The Gemara further explains: <b>And bring the sun into the city,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person</b> should <b>always leave</b> the place where he has spent the night <b>with “it is good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), i.e., after sunrise, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to the creation of light. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one comes into an unfamiliar city <b>he</b> should <b>enter with “it is good,”</b> before sunset, <b>as it is stated: “As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away”</b> (Genesis 44:3). |
| Genesis 44:12 | was found | Pesachim 7b:14 | The Gemara cites the relevant verses included in the above derivation. <b>Finding</b> in one context is derived <b>from finding</b> in another context by verbal analogy, as <b>it is written here: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it is written there: “And he searched, starting with the eldest, and ending with the youngest; and</b> the goblet <b>was found</b> in Benjamin’s sack” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And</b> the word <b>finding</b> in this verse is connected <b>to searching in that same</b> verse by juxtaposition, as the verse says: “And he searched... and was found.” |
| Genesis 44:12 | and it says: “And he searched, starting with the eldest, | Pesachim 8a:1 | <b>because the light of a lamp is effective for searching. And even though there is no proof for</b> this <b>matter, there is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter, as it is stated: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it says: “And he searched, starting with the eldest,</b> and ending with the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s sack…” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And it says: “At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps”</b> (Zephaniah 1:12), <b>and it says: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts”</b> (Proverbs 20:27). |
| Genesis 44:16 | what can we speak, and how can we justify [ nitztadak ]” | Shabbat 105a:5 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is another abbreviation in the Bible: “And Judah said: What can we say to my master, <b>what can we speak, and how can we justify [<i>nitztadak</i>]”</b> (Genesis 44:16), which stands for: <b>We are honest [<i>nekhonim</i>], we are righteous [<i>tzaddikim</i>], we are pure [<i>tehorim</i>], we are innocent [<i>dakkim</i>], we are holy [<i>kedoshim</i>].</b> |
| Genesis 45:3 | When Rabbi Elazar reached this verse, he cried: “And his brethren could not answer him, for they were affrighted at his presence” | Chagigah 4b:8 | The Gemara similarly relates: <b>When Rabbi Elazar reached this verse, he cried: “And his brethren could not answer him, for they were affrighted at his presence”</b> (Genesis 45:3). He said, in explanation of his emotional reaction: <b>If the rebuke of</b> a man of <b>flesh and blood</b> was <b>such</b> that the brothers were unable to respond, when it comes to <b>the rebuke of the Holy One, Blessed be He, all the more so. When Rabbi Elazar reached this verse, he cried: “And Samuel said to Saul: Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up”</b> (I Samuel 28:15). He said: <b>If Samuel the righteous was afraid of judgment</b> when he was raised by necromancy, as he thought he was being summoned for a Divine judgment, <b>all the more so</b> that <b>we</b> should be afraid. |
| Genesis 45:6 | “For these two years the famine has been in the land” | Avodah Zarah9b:3 | <b>But</b> as the Jubilee Year itself is counted as one year of a Sabbatical cycle, <b>he should take, from</b> every <b>hundred</b> years that passed, <b>two</b> years, <b>and add it to the details,</b> i.e., the remaining decades and single years. <b>And</b> then <b>he should calculate</b> with <b>the details</b> by dividing them <b>into Sabbatical</b> cycles. <b>And</b> from the remainder <b>he will know how many years in the</b> current <b>Sabbatical</b> cycle have passed. <b>And your mnemonic</b> that two years must be deducted from every century is the following verse: <b>“For these two years the famine has been in the land”</b> (Genesis 45:6). |
| Genesis 45:12 | “And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin” | Megillah 16b:3 | The verse states: <b>“And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 45:12). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Joseph <b>said to</b> his brothers as follows: <b>Just as I</b> certainly <b>harbor no</b> resentment <b>in my heart toward my brother Benjamin, for he was not</b> even <b>present when I was sold, so too, I harbor no</b> resentment <b>toward you.</b> The verse continues: <b>“That it is my mouth [<i>ki fi</i>] that speaks to you”</b> (Genesis 45:12), i.e., <b>As my mouth [<i>kefi</i>] is, so is my heart.</b> |
| Genesis 45:14 | “And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck [ tzavarei | Megillah 16b:2 | The Gemara elaborates on certain elements in the story of Joseph and his brothers. The verse states with regard to Joseph: <b>“And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck [<i>tzavarei</i></b>] and wept” (Genesis 45:14). The wording of the verse gives rise to a question, as the word <i>tzavarei</i> is plural, meaning necks: <b>How many necks did Benjamin have,</b> such that the verse should use the plural <i>tzavarei</i> rather than the singular <i>tzavar</i>? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This intimates <b>that</b> Joseph <b>cried over the two Temples that were destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Benjamin and were destined to be destroyed.</b> The same verse continues: <b>“And Benjamin wept on his neck”</b> (Genesis 45:14); <b>he cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Joseph and was destined to be destroyed.</b> |
| Genesis 45:22 | five changes | Megillah 16a:24 | Before continuing its midrashic interpretation of the rest of the book of Esther, the Gemara expounds a verse concerning Joseph that relates to the Megilla: <b>“To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave</b> three hundred pieces of silver, and <b>five changes</b> of clothing” (Genesis 45:22). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible that in the</b> very <b>thing from which that righteous man</b> Joseph <b>had suffered,</b> as his father’s show of favoritism toward him aroused the enmity of his brothers, |
| Genesis 45:23 | “And to his father he sent after this manner ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt” | Megillah 16b:4 | The verse states: <b>“And to his father he sent after this manner ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 45:23). The Gemara asks: <b>What are “the good things of Egypt”</b> that are mentioned but not specified here? <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: He sent him aged wine, which the elderly find pleasing.</b> |
| Genesis 45:24 | “See that you not fall out by the way” | Taanit 10b:7 | § The Gemara presents another piece of advice related to the story of Joseph and his brothers. Joseph said to them: <b>“See that you not fall out by the way”</b> (Genesis 45:24). <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Joseph said to his brothers: Do not become occupied in a matter of <i>halakha</i>, lest you fall out on the way.</b> If you discuss a <i>halakha</i> while traveling you might get into an argument, and it is important for travelers to remain on good terms. |
| Genesis 46:2 | “And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob, | Berakhot 13a:12 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse reverts back</b> and God Himself refers to Jacob as Jacob, <b>as it is written</b> before his descent to Egypt: <b>“And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob,</b> and he said, ‘Here I am’” (Genesis 46:2). |
| Genesis 46:4 | to Jacob, to whom You said: “I will go down to Egypt with you” | Shabbat 89b:3 | <b>And</b> the Jewish people <b>will say before Him: Master of the Universe, to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go <b>to Abraham, to whom You said: “Know certainly</b> that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years” (Genesis 15:13), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf?</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Isaac, who blessed Esau</b> and said: <b>“And it shall come to pass when you shall break loose,</b> that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck” (Genesis 27:40), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> Or perhaps we should go <b>to Jacob, to whom You said: “I will go down to Egypt with you”</b> (Genesis 46:4), <b>and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.</b> And if so, <b>to whom shall we go?</b> Shall we go to our Patriarchs, who do not have mercy on us? Rather, <b>now God</b> Himself <b>says</b> what punishment we deserve. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Since you made yourselves dependent on Me, “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow.”</b> |
| Genesis 46:5 | and the children of Israel carried Jacob their father, | Chullin 101b:9 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> to this <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; <b>and the children of Israel carried Jacob their father,</b> and their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him” (Genesis 46:5). This occurred before the Torah was given at Sinai, and therefore proves that the title “the children of Israel” was in use before the Torah was given. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, this occurred <b>after the incident,</b> i.e., after Jacob wrestled with the angel and after the prophetic vision in which God changed Jacob’s name to Israel (Genesis 35:10). |
| Genesis 46:12 | but Er and Onan died | Sotah 13b:8 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The episode with regard to Judah also indicates that one who initiates performance of a mitzva but does not complete it will <b>also bury his wife and children</b> as Judah did, <b>as it is written: “And</b> in process of time <b>Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died”</b> (Genesis 38:12), <b>and it is written</b> further: “And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; <b>but Er and Onan died</b> in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 46:12). |
| Genesis 46:15 | called her a daughter, | Bava Batra120a:1 | The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that this is Jochebed? Jochebed was then <b>130 years old and</b> the verse <b>called her a daughter,</b> indicating one who is very young. Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of Jacob’s descendants who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <b>as Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: This</b> “daughter of Levi” is <b>Jochebed, whose conception</b> occurred <b>on the journey</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born within the walls,</b> i.e., having entered Egypt, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59). |
| Genesis 46:15 | with Dinah, as it is written: “And [ ve’et ] his daughter Dinah” | Bava Batra123a:21 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s family. <b>Abba Ḥalifa Karoya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: In the total</b> tally of Jacob’s family members who descended to Egypt, <b>you find seventy,</b> as stated in the verse: “All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). By contrast, <b>in their individual</b> listing, when the family members of each of his sons are listed by name, <b>you find seventy-less-one.</b> How can this be resolved? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: A twin</b> sister <b>was</b> born <b>with Dinah, as it is written: “And [<i>ve’et</i>] his daughter Dinah”</b> (Genesis 46:15). The term <i>et</i> implies an unspecified additional person. Abba Ḥalifa Karoya replied: <b>If that is so,</b> one would have to say that <b>a twin</b> sister <b>was</b> born <b>with Benjamin, as it is written:</b> |
| Genesis 46:15 | “These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah” | Niddah 31a:24 | <b>The Sages taught: At first,</b> people <b>would say</b> that if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female. But the Sages did not explain</b> from which verse this <b>matter</b> is derived, <b>until Rabbi Tzadok came and explained</b> that <b>it</b> is derived from the following verse: <b>“These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah”</b> (Genesis 46:15). From the fact that the verse <b>attributes the males to the females,</b> as the males are called: The sons of Leah, <b>and</b> it attributes <b>the females to the males,</b>in that Dinah is called: His daughter, it is derived that if the woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male, whereas if the man emits seed first, she bears a female. |
| Genesis 46:15 | calls her a daughter? | Sotah 12a:14 | The verse is referring to Jochebed as <b>“a daughter of Levi”</b> (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that this is Jochebed? Jochebed <b>was</b> then <b>130 years old and</b> the verse still <b>calls her a daughter?</b> Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The “daughter of Levi” <b>is Jochebed, whose conception was on the road,</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born between the walls,</b> i.e., in Egypt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59). |
| Genesis 46:21 | as it is stated: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, | Sotah 36b:16 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joseph was deserving of having twelve tribes descend from him,</b> the same <b>as</b> twelve tribes <b>descended from his father Jacob, as it is stated: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2). This implies that everything that happened to Jacob was destined to happen to Joseph. <b>However,</b> he did not merit this because <b>his semen was emitted from between his fingernails. And even so,</b> the offspring that were meant to descend from him <b>descended from his brother Benjamin,</b> who had ten sons. <b>And they were all named after</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel,</b> Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard” (Genesis 46:21). |
| Genesis 46:23 | “And the sons of Dan: Hushim” | Bava Batra143b:6 | <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that one does refer to a single son using the plural term sons, as it is written: <b>“And the sons of Dan: Hushim”</b> (Genesis 46:23). <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Perhaps</b> this verse should be understood <b>as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught,</b> that Hushim is not the name of Dan’s son but <b>that they,</b> Dan’s sons, <b>were as numerous as</b> the <b>groups [<i>ḥushim</i>] of reeds. Rather, Rava said:</b> One can prove this usage of the term sons in the verse: <b>“And the sons of Pallu: Eliab”</b> (Numbers 26:8). <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This can be proven from another verse: <b>“And the sons of Ethan: Azariah”</b> (I Chronicles 2:8). |
| Genesis 46:27 | you find seventy, | Bava Batra123a:21 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s family. <b>Abba Ḥalifa Karoya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: In the total</b> tally of Jacob’s family members who descended to Egypt, <b>you find seventy,</b> as stated in the verse: “All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27).

| Genesis 47:2 | “And from among his brothers he took five men, | Bava Kamma92a:19 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“And from among his brothers he took five men,</b> and presented them to Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2). <b>Who are these five</b> men? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Those whose names were repeated</b> in the blessings with which Moses later blessed the twelve tribes. They are Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali (see Deuteronomy 35). Since they were weak, Joseph brought them before Pharaoh. |
| Genesis 47:6 | as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle” | Berakhot 63b:22 | <b>Rabbi Yosei began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts, and taught:</b> It is said: <b>“You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as the Egyptians, who only befriended Israel,</b> even when they hosted them, <b>for their own benefit,</b> as Pharaoh said to Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle”</b> (Genesis 47:6), are treated <b>this way, all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions</b> without concern for personal gain, be treated this way. |
| Genesis 47:12 | sustain the poor, as it is written: “And Joseph sustained [ vaykhalkel ] his father and his brethren” | Nazir 3a:6 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that he vowed to <b>sustain the poor, as it is written: “And Joseph sustained [<i>vaykhalkel</i>] his father and his brethren”</b> (Genesis 47:12). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> in the mishna, the case is one <b>where the individual was holding his hair</b> when he made his pronouncement, so that it was clear that he was referring to growing his hair. |
| Genesis 47:14 | Shmuel said: Joseph collected all the silver and gold in the world and brought it to Egypt, as it is stated: “And Joseph collected all the money found | Pesachim 119a:6 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Joseph collected all the silver and gold in the world and brought it to Egypt, as it is stated: “And Joseph collected all the money found</b> in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 47:14). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that he collected the money <b>that</b> was <b>in the land of Egypt and that</b> was <b>in the Land of Canaan. From where</b> do I derive that he also collected all the money <b>that</b> was <b>in other lands? The verse states “And all the land came to Egypt</b> to buy food from Joseph, because the famine was sore in all the earth” (Genesis 41:57). |
| Genesis 47:21 | “And as for the people, he removed them city by city” | Chullin 60b:15 | <b>Similarly,</b> a difficult verse describes Joseph’s treatment of the Egyptians: <b>“And as for the people, he removed them city by city”</b> (Genesis 47:21). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> of this information? It teaches Joseph’s love for his brothers, as he transferred the entire Egyptian population <b>so that they would not call his brothers exiles.</b> |
| Genesis 47:22 | to food? As it is written: “And they ate their allotment [ ḥukkam ], which Pharaoh gave them” | Beitzah 16a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“statute [<i>ḥok</i>]” is a term</b> relating <b>to food? As it is written: “And they ate their allotment [<i>ḥukkam</i>], which Pharaoh gave them”</b> (Genesis 47:22). <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> One can learn that <i>ḥok</i> is referring to food <b>from here: “Feed me with my allotted [<i>ḥukki</i>] bread”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Genesis 47:27 | in the land of Goshen” | Sanhedrin 106a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everywhere that it is stated: And he dwelt, it is nothing other than an expression of pain,</b> of an impending calamity, <b>as it is stated: “And Israel dwelt in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab”</b> (Numbers 25:1). It is stated: <b>“And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan”</b> (Genesis 37:1), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And Joseph brought evil report of them to his father”</b> (Genesis 37:2), which led to the sale of Joseph. <b>And it is stated: “And Israel dwelt</b> in the land of Egypt <b>in the land of Goshen”</b> (Genesis 47:27), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the time drew near that Israel was to die”</b> (Genesis 47:29). It is stated: <b>“And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree”</b> (I Kings 5:5), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom”</b> (I Kings 11:14). |
| Genesis 47:29 | “And the time drew near that Israel was to die” | Sanhedrin 106a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everywhere that it is stated: And he dwelt, it is nothing other than an expression of pain,</b> of an impending calamity, <b>as it is stated: “And Israel dwelt in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab”</b> (Numbers 25:1).

| Genesis 47:30 | “You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place” | Ketubot 111a:22 | § The verse states that Jacob commanded Joseph: <b>“You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place”</b> (Genesis 47:30). <b>Karna said:</b> There are <b>inner matters</b> here, i.e., a secret meaning: <b>Our Patriarch Jacob knew that he was completely righteous, and if the dead of</b> the lands <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael come <b>alive, why did he trouble his sons</b> to bring him to Eretz Yisrael? The reason is that he was concerned <b>lest he not merit the tunnels.</b> |
| Genesis 47:30 | “You shall carry me out from Egypt” | Nazir 65a:6 | § The mishna taught that <b>he removes them and their surrounding</b> earth. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>surrounding</b> earth? <b>Rav Yehuda said: The verse states</b> with regard to Jacob’s instruction to Joseph to transfer his remains to Eretz Yisrael: <b>“You shall carry me out from Egypt”</b> (Genesis 47:30), which indicates: <b>Take</b> some earth out from Egypt <b>with me,</b> i.e., take the earth that is near the corpse. |
| Genesis 47:31 | “And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed” | Megillah 16b:6 | The Gemara expresses astonishment at the use of this parable: Are you calling Joseph <b>a fox? What, was he inferior to his brothers</b> such that in relation to them you call him a fox? <b>Rather, if such a statement was stated, it was stated as follows,</b> not in connection with this verse, but rather in connection with a different verse. The verse states: <b>“And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed”</b> (Genesis 47:31). With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> as Jacob had to bow down before his son Joseph, who had reached greatness. |
| Genesis 48:1 | as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is sick” | Bava Metzia87a:15 | <b>Until Jacob, there was no illness</b> leading up to death; rather, one would die suddenly. <b>Jacob came and prayed for mercy, and illness was</b> brought to the world, allowing one to prepare for his death, <b>as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is sick”</b> (Genesis 48:1), which is the first time that sickness preceding death is mentioned in the Bible. <b>Until Elisha, one did not fall ill and</b> then <b>heal,</b> as everyone who fell ill would die. <b>Elisha came and prayed for mercy and he was healed, as it is written: “Now Elisha fell ill with his illness from which he was to die”</b> (II Kings 13:14). <b>By inference,</b> one can derive that <b>he</b> had previously <b>fallen ill</b> with <b>other illnesses</b> from which he did not die. |
| Genesis 48:1 | prayed for mercy and there was weakness, as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill” | Sanhedrin 107b:17 | Apropos the death of Elisha, the Gemara says: <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Abraham there was no aging,</b> and the old and the young looked the same. <b>Anyone who saw Abraham said: That is Isaac,</b> and <b>anyone who saw Isaac said: That is Abraham. Abraham prayed for mercy, that he would undergo aging, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age”</b> (Genesis 24:1). There is no mention of aging before that verse. <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Jacob there was no weakness,</b> i.e., illness. Jacob <b>prayed for mercy and there was weakness, as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill”</b> (Genesis 48:1). <b>Until</b> the time of <b>Elisha, there was no ill person who recovered, and Elisha came and prayed for mercy and recovered, as it is stated: “And Elisha was fallen ill of his illness from which he was to die”</b> (II Kings 13:14). That is the first mention of a person who was ill and who did not die from that illness. |
| Genesis 48:4 | “And said to me: Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a congregation of peoples” | Horayot 5b:15 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this: From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps Jerusalem is different, as</b> Jerusalem <b>was also</b> in the tribal land of <b>Benjamin.</b> Accordingly, it was shared by two tribes. <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that proof that a tribe is characterized as a congregation is derived from another verse, <b>as it is written</b> that Jacob recounted what God said to him when he returned from Paddan: <b>“And said to me: Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a congregation of peoples”</b> (Genesis 48:4). <b>Who was born to him</b> from <b>that time</b> on? Only <b>Benjamin. Conclude from it</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>the Merciful One is saying</b> to Jacob: <b>Another congregation shall be now born to you.</b> Apparently, one tribe is characterized as a congregation. |
| Genesis 48:4 | Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ya’akov, said: The tribe of Levi is not characterized as a congregation, as it is written: “Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a congregation of peoples; | Horayot 6b:2 | <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ya’akov, said: The tribe of Levi is not characterized as a congregation, as it is written: “Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a congregation of peoples;</b> and I will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession” (Genesis 48:4). It is derived from here that <b>any</b> tribe <b>that has</b> an ancestral <b>possession</b> bequeathed to it <b>is characterized as a congregation, and any</b> tribe <b>that does not have</b> an ancestral <b>possession</b> bequeathed to it <b>is not characterized as a congregation.</b> The tribe of Levi has no ancestral land, and the priests who are from the tribe of Levi have no ancestral land. |
| Genesis 48:5 | verse states: “Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine” | Bava Batra123a:10 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the term “one portion” is referring to <b>a mere palm tree</b> or some other relatively small extra gift, instead of a full, equal share? Abaye <b>said to him: For you,</b> i.e., to answer your question, the <b>verse states: “Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine”</b> (Genesis 48:5). Evidently, Joseph’s children together received portions equal to that of Reuben and Simeon together, i.e., two full portions. |
| Genesis 48:5 | “Ephraim and Manasseh shall be like Reuben and Simeon to me” | Horayot 6b:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, the twelve tribes are lacking</b> in number, as without the tribe of Levi there are only eleven. <b>Abaye said</b> that it is stated: <b>“Ephraim and Manasseh shall be like Reuben and Simeon to me”</b> (Genesis 48:5), and they are counted as two tribes. <b>Rava said: But isn’t it written: “After the name of their brethren shall they be called in their inheritance”</b> (Genesis 48:6), indicating that it is <b>with regard to inheritance</b> that <b>they are likened</b> to tribes, <b>but not with regard to another matter?</b> |
| Genesis 48:5 | And your mnemonic is “Ephraim and Manasseh will be to me like Reuben and Simeon” | Ketubot 72b:5 | § The mishna stated: <b>Abba Shaul says: Also</b> a woman <b>who curses</b> her husband’s <b>parents in his presence</b> violates the precepts of Jewish women. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Even <b>when she curses his parents in the presence of his children</b> and not in his presence she is considered one who violates Jewish custom. <b>And your mnemonic is “Ephraim and Manasseh will be to me like Reuben and Simeon”</b> (Genesis 48:5), which teaches that grandchildren have the status of children. Cursing one’s husband’s parents in front of his children is tantamount to doing so in front of the husband himself. <b>Rabba said:</b> An example is <b>that she said in the presence of</b> her husband’s <b>son: May a lion devour</b> your <b>grandfather.</b> |
| Genesis 48:5 | “Your two sons who were born [ noladim ] to you in the land of Egypt” | Nedarim 30b:11 | With regard to the distinction between the terms in the mishna, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Is this to say that</b> the word <b><i>noladim</i> means those who will be born</b> in the future? <b>But if that is so,</b> it says in the verse: <b>“Your two sons who were born [<i>noladim</i>] to you in the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 48:5), <b>does it also</b> mean <b>those who will be born?</b> The verse is referring to Manasseh and Ephraim, who were already alive. |
| Genesis 48:6 | Rava said: But isn’t it written: “After the name of their brethren shall they be called in their inheritance” | Horayot 6b:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, the twelve tribes are lacking</b> in number, as without the tribe of Levi there are only eleven. <b>Abaye said</b> that it is stated: <b>“Ephraim and Manasseh shall be like Reuben and Simeon to me”</b> (Genesis 48:5), and they are counted as two tribes. <b>Rava said: But isn’t it written: “After the name of their brethren shall they be called in their inheritance”</b> (Genesis 48:6), indicating that it is <b>with regard to inheritance</b> that <b>they are likened</b> to tribes, <b>but not with regard to another matter?</b> |
| Genesis 48:6 | It is stated here: “He shall succeed in the name of his brother,” and it is stated there: “They shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance” | Yevamot 24a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: Do <b>you say</b> that he succeeds in the name of his brother <b>for inheritance, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only to</b> inherit <b>his name?</b> If, e.g., the deceased brother was named <b>Yosef, they</b> must <b>call</b> the son born from levirate marriage <b>Yosef,</b> or if his name was <b>Yoḥanan,</b> then <b>they</b> must <b>call him Yoḥanan.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here: “He shall succeed in the name of his brother,” and it is stated there: “They shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance”</b> (Genesis 48:6). <b>Just as</b> the word <b>“name” stated there</b> in Genesis is referring explicitly to <b>inheritance, so too,</b> the word <b>“name” stated here</b> in Leviticus means with regard <b>to inheritance.</b> |
| Genesis 48:7 | “And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died on me” | Sanhedrin 22b:4 | It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man dies only to his wife,</b> i.e., it is primarily she who suffers the pain and sadness resulting from his death, <b>and a woman dies only to her husband. A man dies only to his wife, as it is stated: “And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died”</b> (Ruth 1:3), <b>and a woman dies only to her husband, as it is stated</b> in Jacob’s parting words to Joseph: <b>“And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died on me”</b> (Genesis 48:7). |
| Genesis 48:10 | Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age” | Yoma 28b:7 | When <b>they were in Egypt</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when <b>they were in the desert,</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16). <b>Abraham our Patriarch</b> was himself <b>an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years”</b> (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <b>Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old</b> and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, <b>Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age”</b> (Genesis 48:10). |
| Genesis 48:14 | “Guiding his hands [ yadav ] wittingly, | Menachot 93b:16 | Reish Lakish <b>raised objections against him</b> from <b>twenty-four</b> occasions where the Torah writes: <b>His hands,</b> for example: <b>“His own hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30); <b>“his hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall contend for him,</b> and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7); <b>“Guiding his hands [<i>yadav</i>] wittingly,</b> for Manasseh was the firstborn” (Genesis 48:14). Rabbi Elazar <b>was silent,</b> as he had no response. |
| Genesis 48:15 | whereas, with regard to sustenance, it is written: “The God who has been my shepherd | Pesachim 118a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is more difficult than the redemption. While, with regard to the redemption, it is written: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil”</b> (Genesis 48:16), indicating that <b>a mere angel</b> is sufficient to protect a person from all evil; <b>whereas, with regard to sustenance, it is written: “The God who has been my shepherd</b> all my life long to this day” (Genesis 48:15). This verse implies that only God can help one who is struggling to earn a living. |
| Genesis 48:16 | and let them grow into a multitude [ veyidgu ] in the midst of the earth” | Bava Batra118b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that a proof for the notion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants, is <b>from here,</b> Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; <b>and let them grow into a multitude [<i>veyidgu</i>] in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <i>Veyidgu</i> is related etymologically to the word for fish [<i>dag</i>]. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the fish in the sea, water covers them and the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them, so too, the seed of Joseph, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b> |
| Genesis 48:16 | from here: “And let them grow [ veyidgu ] into a multitude in the midst of the earth” | Bava Metzia84a:11 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, the water covers them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them,</b> as they are not seen, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of Joseph, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b> |
| Genesis 48:16 | veyidgu ] in the midst of the earth” | Berakhot 20a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> cited a different proof, from Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Menashe: “The angel who redeems me from all evil shall bless the young and in them may my name be recalled, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, <b>and may they multiply</b> [<b><i>veyidgu</i>] in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <i>Veyidgu</i> is related etymologically to the word fish [<i>dag</i>]. <b>Just as the fish in the sea, water covers them and the evil eye has no dominion over them,</b> so <b>too the seed of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.</b> |
| Genesis 48:16 | “And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth” | Berakhot 55b:12 | <b>Another began and said: One who enters a city and fears the evil eye</b> should <b>hold the thumb [<i>zekafa</i>] of his right hand in his left hand and the thumb of his left hand in his right hand and recite the following: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, come from the descendants of Joseph,</b> over whom <b>the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>];</b> its branches run over the wall” (Genesis 49:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>alei ayin</i>; but rather,</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>, who rise above the eye</b> and the evil eye has no dominion over him. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Derive it <b>from here,</b> from what is stated in Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons: <b>“And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16): <b>Just as fish in the sea are covered by water and the evil eye has no dominion over them</b> as they cannot be seen, <b>so too the offspring of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.

| Genesis 48:16 | a person’s food is more difficult than the redemption. While, with regard to the redemption, it is written: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil” | Pesachim 118a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is more difficult than the redemption. While, with regard to the redemption, it is written: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil”</b> (Genesis 48:16), indicating that <b>a mere angel</b> is sufficient to protect a person from all evil; <b>whereas, with regard to sustenance, it is written: “The God who has been my shepherd</b> all my life long to this day” (Genesis 48:15). This verse implies that only God can help one who is struggling to earn a living. |
| Genesis 48:16 | “And let them grow [ veyidgu ] into a multitude in the midst of the earth” | Sotah 36b:7 | The Gemara cites an alternative source for the assertion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> Jacob blessed Joseph’s children and said: <b>“And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, waters cover them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them, so too,</b> with regard to <b>Joseph’s descendants, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b> |
| Genesis 48:17 | called yad , as it is stated: “And when Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand [ yad yemino ]” | Menachot 37a:1 | <b>Rabbi Yosei HaḤorem says:</b> This is no proof, as <b>we have found that</b> the <b>right</b> hand is also <b>called <i>yad</i>, as it is stated: “And when Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand [<i>yad yemino</i>]”</b> (Genesis 48:17). The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who maintains that the right hand is not called <i>yad</i>, how does he respond to this proof? He maintains that the right hand <b>is called “his right hand [<i>yad yemino</i>],”</b> but it <b>is not called a <i>yad</i> without</b> further <b>specification.</b> |
| Genesis 48:19 | “And his seed shall become a multitude of nations” | Avodah Zarah25a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And where is it alluded</b> to in Genesis that the sun would stand still for Joshua? The verse states in reference to Ephraim, who was Joshua’s ancestor: <b>“And his seed shall become a multitude of nations”</b> (Genesis 48:19). The Gemara asks: <b>When will he become a multitude of nations?</b> He became a multitude of nations <b>at the time when the sun stood</b> in place <b>for Joshua,</b> as it is written: <b>“And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down for an entire day”</b> (Joshua 10:13). |
| Genesis 48:22 | states: “Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow” | Bava Batra123a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> cites additional related verses: <b>And</b> with regard to Jacob’s bequest to Joseph, the verse <b>states: “Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow”</b> (Genesis 48:22). The <i>baraita</i> explains the verse: <b>But</b> is it <b>so that</b> Jacob <b>took</b> the portion <b>with his sword and with his bow? But isn’t it already stated:</b> “Through You do we push down our adversaries; through Your name do we trample those that rise against us. <b>For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me”</b> (Psalms 44:6–7)? <b>Rather,</b> what is the meaning of “with <b>my sword”? This</b> is referring to <b>prayer.</b> What is the meaning of “with <b>my bow”? This</b> is referring to <b>petition.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Genesis 49:1 | “And Jacob called his sons and said, Gather around and I will tell you | Pesachim 56a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> that it is written: <b>“And Jacob called his sons and said, Gather around and I will tell you</b> what will occur to you in the end of days” (Genesis 49:1). <b>Jacob wanted to reveal to his sons</b> when the complete redemption would arrive at <b>the end of days</b> (see Daniel 12:13), <b>but the Divine Presence abandoned him,</b> rendering him unable to prophesy. <b>He said: Perhaps</b> the Divine Presence has abandoned me because, <b>Heaven forfend, one of my descendants is unfit, as</b> was the case with my grandfather <b>Abraham, from whom Ishmael emerged, and</b> like <b>my father Isaac, from whom Esau emerged. His sons said to him: Hear Israel,</b> our father, <b>the Lord is our God, the Lord is One. They said: Just as there is only one</b> God <b>in your heart, so too, there is only one in our hearts. At that moment Jacob our father said</b> in praise: <b>Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever,</b> as all his children were righteous. |
| Genesis 49:3 | my might and the first fruits of my strength” | Yevamot 76a:4 | <b>Abaye said: Is that to say</b> that <b>everyone is</b> like <b>our Patriarch Jacob, with regard to whom it is written:</b> “Reuben, you are my firstborn, <b>my might and the first fruits of my strength”</b> (Genesis 49:3), implying <b>that</b> Jacob <b>never experienced an emission of semen in all his days,</b> so that his eldest son Reuben was conceived from his first drop of seed, i.e., “the first fruits of my strength.” The implication is that there is certainly no need for such measures in order to bring a man to ejaculate. |
| Genesis 49:4 | then you did defile it; he went up to my bed [ yetzu ’ i ]” | Shabbat 55b:8 | <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: He rearranged two beds, one of the Divine Presence and one of his father. And that is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written:</b> “Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father’s bed; <b>then you did defile it; he went up to my bed [<i>yetzu</i>’<i>i</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:4). <b>Do not read it as <i>yetzu’i</i>,</b> in the singular; <b>rather, read it as <i>yetzu</i>’<i>ai</i>, my beds,</b> in the plural, referring to both the bed of his father and to the bed of the Divine Presence, which rests in the tents of the righteous. |
| Genesis 49:6 | as it is stated: “Let my soul not come into their council; to their assembly let my honor not be united” | Sanhedrin 109b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if Korah’s lineage is being interpreted disparagingly, why not <b>let</b> the Torah <b>also include: Son of Jacob [<i>Ya’akov</i>],</b> and interpret it: <b>A son who contorted [<i>she’akav</i>] himself</b> until he reached <b>Gehenna? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Jacob prayed for mercy for himself</b> that his name would not be included in the lineage of Korah, <b>as it is stated: “Let my soul not come into their council; to their assembly let my honor not be united”</b> (Genesis 49:6). <b>“Let my soul not come into their council”; these are</b> the <b>spies.</b> Jacob prayed that his name would not be mentioned in their regard. <b>“To their assembly let my honor not be united”; this</b> is referring to <b>the assembly of Korah.</b> |
| Genesis 49:7 | “ Arur ” | Yoma 52b:4 | The fourth case is the term: <b>“<i>Arur</i>”</b> (Genesis 49:7). This verse can be read: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel,” on account of Levi and Simeon’s treatment of Shechem. Alternatively, this term, which appears at the beginning of the verse, can be read as the last word of the previous verse: “And in their anger they cut off cursed [<i>arur</i>] oxen” (Genesis 49:6–7). According to this interpretation, “cursed oxen” is referring to the oxen of Shechem, who descended from the accursed Canaan. |
| Genesis 49:8 | “Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the nape of your enemies” | Avodah Zarah25a:12 | The Gemara further analyzes the verse in Samuel: <b>And where is it alluded</b> to in Genesis that Judah must be taught to use the bow? The verse states: <b>“Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the nape of your enemies”</b> (Genesis 49:8). The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the form of <b>warfare that requires</b> one’s <b>hand</b> to be held <b>opposite</b> the <b>nape? You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to the use of <b>a bow.</b> This is the referent of the verse in Samuel. |
| Genesis 49:8 | as it is written: “Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies” | Megillah 16a:14 | The Gemara explains that their wise remark, which earned them their distinction, is contained in their advice: <b>“If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews [<i>Yehudim</i>],</b> then you will not prevail over him” (Esther 6:13). The word <i>Yehudim</i> can also refer to people from the tribe of Judah. Haman’s wise men thereby <b>said to him: If he descends from the other tribes, you can</b> still <b>prevail over him, but if he</b> descends <b>from the tribe of</b> either <b>Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, or Manasseh, you cannot prevail over him.</b> With regard to <b>Judah,</b> the proof of this is <b>as it is written: “Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies”</b> (Genesis 49:8), indicating that Judah will emerge victorious over his enemies. And the proof that Haman cannot prevail over <b>the others</b> that were mentioned is <b>as it is written with regard to them: “Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your might”</b> (Psalms 80:3). |
| Genesis 49:9 | a lion’s whelp” | Sotah 11b:20 | <b>Rather,</b> the midwives <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>This nation is compared to an animal [<i>ḥayya</i>],</b> and animals give birth without a midwife. For example, with regard to <b>Judah</b> it is written: “Judah is <b>a lion’s whelp”</b> (Genesis 49:9); with regard to <b>Dan</b> it is written: <b>“Dan shall be a serpent</b> in the way” (Genesis 49:17); with regard to <b>Naphtali</b> it is written: <b>“A hind let loose”</b> (Genesis 49:21); with regard to <b>Issachar</b> it is written: <b>“A large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14); with regard to <b>Joseph</b> it is written: “His <b>first bullock”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17); with regard to <b>Benjamin</b> it is written: <b>“A ravenous wolf”</b> (Genesis 49:27). |
| Genesis 49:10 | “The scepter shall not depart from Judah” | Horayot 11b:3 | <b>Rav Safra taught</b> the exchange in <b>this</b> manner: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> In a case <b>where I</b> perform an unwitting transgression, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: Would I be liable to atone <b>with a male goat</b> as a sin-offering because I am the <i>Nasi</i>, or is my atonement with a ewe or a female goat, like a commoner, because I am not the king? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: There,</b> the Exilarch has authority that is represented by <b>a scepter; here,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, we have lesser authority, which is represented by <b>a staff. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The scepter shall not depart from Judah”</b> (Genesis 49:10); <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>the Exilarch in Babylonia, who reigns over the Jewish people with a rod,</b> as he is authorized by the gentile monarchy to impose his will. <b>“Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet”</b> (Genesis 49:10); <b>these are the descendants of Hillel, who</b> serve in the role of the <i>Nasi</i> and <b>teach Torah to the Jewish people in public,</b> but who are not authorized by the government to impose their will. |
| Genesis 49:10 | as it is taught | Sanhedrin 5a:6 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes” (Genesis 49:10). The term “Shiloh” is understood as a reference to the Messiah, and therefore the verse is interpreted as delineating the authority of Jewish rulers during the exile, before the Messiah comes. <b>“The scepter shall not depart from Judah”; these are the Exilarchs in Babylonia, who</b> are empowered by the government and consequently <b>subjugate the Jewish people</b> as <b>with a scepter. “Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet”; These are the grandchildren of Hillel</b> the Elder <b>who</b> hold the position of <i>Nasi</i> and <b>teach Torah in public,</b> but do not have authority to actually enforce their judgments. |
| Genesis 49:10 | What is his name? The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come” | Sanhedrin 98b:14 | Apropos the Messiah, the Gemara asks: <b>What is his name? The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come”</b> (Genesis 49:10). <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [<i>yinnon</i>] as long as the sun;</b> and may men bless themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [<i>ḥanina</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 16:13). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>] that should relieve my soul is far from me”</b> (Lamentations 1:16). <b>And the Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 53:4). |
| Genesis 49:11 | should anticipate the Messiah, as it is stated: “Binding his foal unto the vine and his donkey’s colt unto the vine branch” | Berakhot 57a:6 | <b>One who sees a vine laden</b> with grapes <b>in a dream,</b> it is an omen that <b>his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine,</b> in the innermost parts of your house” (Psalms 128:3). One who sees <b>a</b> planted <b>vine branch</b> in a dream <b>should anticipate the Messiah, as it is stated: “Binding his foal unto the vine and his donkey’s colt unto the vine branch”</b> (Genesis 49:11). |
| Genesis 49:11 | which is written: “Binding his foal to the vine” | Ketubot 111b:16 | § <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Binding his foal to the vine”</b> (Genesis 49:11), which is interpreted as a prophecy for the future? It means that <b>every grapevine you have in Eretz Yisrael requires a foal to</b> carry the load of its <b>harvest.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine [<i>soreka</i>].”</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Every barren [<i>serak</i>] tree you have in Eretz Yisrael will produce</b> sufficient fruit in the future <b>to load</b> upon <b>two donkeys. And lest you say</b> that these trees <b>do not contain wine, the</b> same <b>verse states: “He washes his garments in wine.” And lest you say</b> that the wine <b>is not red, the verse states: “And from the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14). |
| Genesis 49:11 | the verse states: “And his vesture [ suto ] | Ketubot 111b:17 | <b>And lest you say</b> that this wine <b>does not inebriate</b> those who drink it, <b>the verse states: “And his vesture [<i>suto</i>]</b> in the blood of grapes” (Genesis 49:11). This verse indicates that these wines will induce [<i>mesit</i>] a state of drunkenness. <b>And lest you say</b> that this wine <b>has no flavor, the verse states: “His eyes shall be red [<i>ḥakhlili</i>] with wine”</b> (Genesis 49:12). This unusual term is read homiletically as follows: <b>Each palate [<i>ḥeikh</i>] that tastes it says:</b> This is <b>for me, for me [<i>li li</i>]. And lest you say</b> that the wine <b>is good for the young but it is not good for the old, the verse states: “And his teeth white [<i>leven shinayim</i>] with milk”</b> (Genesis 49:12). <b>Do not read</b> this expression as <b><i>leven shinayim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>leven shanim</i>,</b> one of years, i.e., an elderly person. |

This unusual term is read homiletically as follows: <b>Each palate [<i>ḥeikh</i>] that tastes it says:</b> This is <b>for me, for me [<i>li li</i>]. And lest you say</b> that the wine <b>is good for the young but it is not good for the old, the verse states: “And his teeth white [<i>leven shinayim</i>] with milk”</b> (Genesis 49:12). <b>Do not read</b> this expression as <b><i>leven shinayim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>leven shanim</i>,</b> one of years, i.e., an elderly person. |
| Genesis 49:12 | is better than one who gives him milk to drink, as it is stated: “And his teeth white [ leven shinayim ] with milk” | Ketubot 111b:19 | The Gemara comments: This interpretation <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who whitens his teeth to his friend</b> by smiling at him <b>is better than one who gives him milk to drink, as it is stated: “And his teeth white [<i>leven shinayim</i>] with milk”</b> (Genesis 49:12). <b>Do not read</b> this expression as <b><i>leven shinayim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>libbun shinayim</i>,</b> the whitening of teeth. Likewise, the phrase: With milk, can be read as: Than milk. |
| Genesis 49:13 | Zebulun, as it is written: “Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore” | Pesachim 4a:4 | The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A certain</b> man <b>would</b> regularly <b>walk and say: The bushes on the seashore are cypresses</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>), i.e., items located by the sea are more beautiful than those found in other places. <b>They examined</b> his lineage <b>and found that he descends from</b> the tribe of <b>Zebulun, as it is written: “Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore”</b> (Genesis 49:13). That explains his love of all things close to the sea. |
| Genesis 49:14 | as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey” | Bava Kamma17a:10 | <b>And</b> the fact that <b>he merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes</b> is derived as follows: The reference to the ox in the verse is an allusion to Joseph, who is described as an ox (Deuteronomy 33:17), and one’s reward is that <b>he merits to</b> receive <b>a canopy</b> of honor, <b>as</b> did <b>Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine,</b> a fruitful vine by a fountain; <b>its branches run over the wall.”</b> The branches over the wall in this verse allude to the canopy. <b>And</b> the reference to the donkey is an allusion to the fact that <b>he merits</b> to receive <b>the portion of Issachar,</b> who is described as a donkey, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). |
| Genesis 49:14 | it is written: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey” | Nedarim 20b:11 | <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>it is written: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). The Sages transmitted a tradition that this is an allusion to the incident when Jacob came in from the field riding on a donkey, and Leah went out to greet him, saying: “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:16). Issachar was conceived from their subsequent sexual intercourse. <b>And it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33). The descendants of Issachar were understanding men. It is derived from here that a woman who demands from her husband that he engage in sexual intercourse with her has a positive effect on their children. |
| Genesis 49:14 | as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned [ garem ] donkey” | Niddah 31a:22 | <b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> the same as that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written,</b> with regard to Leah’s conceiving Issachar: <b>“And he lay with her that night”</b> (Genesis 30:16)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, contributed to that act.</b> The manner in which God contributed to this act is derived from another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned [<i>garem</i>] donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). This teaches that God directed Jacob’s <b>donkey</b> toward Leah’s tent so that he would engage in intercourse with her, thereby <b>causing [<i>garam</i>]</b> Leah’s conceiving <b>Issachar.</b> |
| Genesis 49:14 | “A large-boned donkey” | Sotah 11b:20 | <b>Rather,</b> the midwives <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>This nation is compared to an animal [<i>ḥayya</i>],</b> and animals give birth without a midwife.

| Genesis 49:16 | Dan, as it is written: “Dan will judge [ yadin ] his people like one of the tribes of Israel” | Pesachim 4a:3 | With regard to the precision required in language, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain</b> man <b>would</b> regularly <b>say</b> whenever involved in conflict: <b>Adjudicate my case [<i>dunu dini</i>].</b> The Sages <b>said: Learn from it</b> that <b>he descends from</b> the tribe of <b>Dan, as it is written: “Dan will judge [<i>yadin</i>] his people like one of the tribes of Israel”</b> (Genesis 49:16). He expressed himself that way due to his lineage. |
| Genesis 49:16 | as it is stated: “Dan shall judge his people, as one | Sotah 10a:8 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Samson judged the Jewish people as their Father in Heaven</b> does, with complete justice, <b>as it is stated: “Dan shall judge his people, as one</b> of the tribes of Israel” (Genesis 49:16), which is interpreted to mean that Samson, from the tribe of Dan, judges his people just as God, Who is “One.” <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Samson [<i>Shimshon</i>] is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the Lord God is a sun [<i>shemesh</i>] and a shield”</b> (Psalms 84:12). The Gemara comments: <b>If that is so,</b> then his name <b>should not be erased</b> just like other sanctified names are not erased. <b>Rather,</b> he is not called by the name of God but his name <b>is akin to the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> for <b>just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, protects the entire world, so too Samson, in his generation, protected all the Jewish people.</b> |
| Genesis 49:17 | an adder [ shefifon ] in the path that bites the horse’s heels” | Sanhedrin 105a:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Balaam was disabled in one of his legs, as it is stated</b> concerning him: <b>“And he went limping [<i>shefi</i>]”</b> (Numbers 23:3). <b>Samson</b> was disabled <b>in both his legs, as it is stated</b> with regard to Samson, who was from the tribe of Dan, in the prophetic blessing of Jacob: “Dan shall be a serpent by the way, <b>an adder [<i>shefifon</i>] in the path that bites the horse’s heels”</b> (Genesis 49:17). Rabbi Yoḥanan interprets <i>shefifon</i> as the plural of <i>shefi</i>, indicating disability in both legs. <b>Balaam was blind in one of his eyes, as it is stated: “Whose eye is open”</b> (Numbers 24:3), indicating that one eye was open and the other was blind. |
| Genesis 49:17 | a horned snake [ shefifon ] in the path” | Sotah 10a:9 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Balaam was lame in one of his legs, as it is stated</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he went, limping [<i>shefi</i>]”</b> (Numbers 23:3). <b>Samson was lame in</b> both of <b>his two legs, as it is stated</b> that when Jacob mentioned the tribe of Dan in the prophecy that pertained to Samson, he referred to him as: “Dan shall be a serpent in the way, <b>a horned snake [<i>shefifon</i>] in the path”</b> (Genesis 49:17), which is double <i>shefi</i>, i.e., doubly lame. |

| Genesis 49:22 | whom the evil eye had no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [ alei ayin ]” | Bava Batra118b:1 | Joseph’s descendants <b>said to him: We are of the descendants of Joseph,</b> upon <b>whom the evil eye had no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu states</b> a homiletic interpretation: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“<i>alei ayin</i>,” rather</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>,</b> above the eye, i.e., he transcended the influence of the evil eye. Joseph’s descendants were saying that they also do not need to be wary. |
| Genesis 49:22 | said to them: I come from the offspring of Joseph, over whom the evil eye does not have dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [ alei ayin ]” | Bava Metzia84a:10 | <b>The Rabbis said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Isn’t the Master worried about</b> being harmed by <b>the evil eye</b> by displaying yourself in this manner?

He said to them: I descend from the seed of Joseph over whom the evil eye has no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a bountiful vine, a bountiful vine on a spring [ alei ayin ]” | Berakhot 20a:7 | Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was accustomed to go and sit</b> at <b>the gates of the</b> women’s <b>immersion</b> sites. Rabbi Yoḥanan, who was known for his extraordinary good looks, explained this and <b>said: When the daughters of Israel emerge from their immersion, they will look at me, and will have children as beautiful as I.

He said to them: I descend from the seed of Joseph over whom the evil eye has no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a bountiful vine, a bountiful vine on a spring [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22). “<i>Ayin</i>” can mean both “spring” and “eye.” <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said</b> a homiletic interpretation: <b>Do not read</b> it <b><i>alei ayin</i>, rather <i>olei ayin</i>,</b> above the eye; they transcend the influence of the evil eye. |
| Genesis 49:22 | the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [ alei ayin ]; | Berakhot 55b:12 | <b>Another began and said: One who enters a city and fears the evil eye</b> should <b>hold the thumb [<i>zekafa</i>] of his right hand in his left hand and the thumb of his left hand in his right hand and recite the following: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, come from the descendants of Joseph,</b> over whom <b>the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>];</b> its branches run over the wall” (Genesis 49:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>alei ayin</i>; but rather,</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>, who rise above the eye</b> and the evil eye has no dominion over him. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Derive it <b>from here,</b> from what is stated in Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons: <b>“And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16): <b>Just as fish in the sea are covered by water and the evil eye has no dominion over them</b> as they cannot be seen, <b>so too the offspring of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.

| Genesis 49:22 | said to him: The evil eye does not have dominion over the offspring of Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain” | Sotah 36b:6 | The Gemara explains that Joshua <b>said to them: Go and hide yourselves in the forests, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you,</b> as you are such a large number of people. The tribe of Joseph <b>said to him: The evil eye does not have dominion over the offspring of Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> the verse as saying: <b>“By a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Those who rise above</b> the evil <b>eye [<i>olei ayin</i>],</b> teaching that Joseph and his descendants are not susceptible to the evil eye. |
| Genesis 49:22 | “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [ ayin ]” | Zevachim 118b:2 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that a different biblical allusion may be found in what <b>the verse states</b> in the context of Jacob’s blessing to Joseph: <b>“Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22). The Gemara interprets the word fountain homiletically: <b>An eye [<i>ayin</i>] that did not wish to partake or derive benefit from something that was not his,</b> i.e., the wife of Potiphar, <b>shall merit</b> to have offerings of lesser sanctity <b>consumed</b> in Shiloh, in Joseph’s portion of Eretz Yisrael, <b>to the fullest</b> extent <b>of its eyes,</b> i.e., from wherever Shiloh can be seen. |
| Genesis 49:24 | Immediately: “And his bow abode [ teishev ] firm” | Sotah 36b:14 | <b>Immediately: “And his bow abode [<i>teishev</i>] firm”</b> (Genesis 49:24). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> This means <b>that his bow,</b> i.e., his penis, <b>returned [<i>shava</i>] to its strength,</b> as he overcame his desire. The verse about Joseph continues: <b>“And the arms of his hands were made supple”</b> (Genesis 49:24), meaning that <b>he dug his hands into the ground and his semen was emitted between his fingernails.</b> |
| Genesis 49:24 | “By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob” | Sotah 36b:15 | <b>“By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob”</b> (Genesis 49:24): <b>Who caused his</b> name <b>to be etched onto the stones of the ephod?</b> It was <b>only the might of Jacob. “From there, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel”</b> (Genesis 49:24) means: <b>From there,</b> because of Joseph’s ability to withstand this trial, <b>he merited to become a shepherd [<i>ro’eh</i>]</b> of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads like the flock of Joseph”</b> (Psalms 80:2). |

The language of the verse alludes to the fact that Joseph conducted himself like a nazirite and abstained from wine. |
| Genesis 49:27 | “A ravenous wolf” | Sotah 11b:20 | <b>Rather,</b> the midwives <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>This nation is compared to an animal [<i>ḥayya</i>],</b> and animals give birth without a midwife.

| Genesis 49:27 | of the one who tears, | Zevachim 53b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that there was no base on the southeast corner of the altar? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Because it was not in the portion</b> of land <b>of the one who tears,</b> i.e., the tribe of Benjamin, as he is described in the following manner: “Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). <b>As Rav Shmuel, son of Rav Yitzḥak, says:</b> The <b>altar</b> would <b>consume,</b> i.e., occupy, <b>one cubit of the portion of Judah.</b> The part of the altar in Judah’s portion was the southeast corner of the base, and therefore there was no base on that corner. |
| Genesis 49:27 | blood | Zevachim 54a:4 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that the southeast corner of the altar <b>had no base? Rav says:</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that it had no base <b>built</b> on those sides. <b>Levi says:</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that no <b>blood</b> was sprinkled on that side, as the blood was not permitted to be presented there, even though there was a physical base. Based on this dispute, each of them disagreed as to the correct Aramaic translation of the verse: “Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). <b>Rav translates</b> this as: <b>In his portion will the altar be built. Levi translates</b> this as: <b>In his portion will the Sanctuary be built,</b> which means: <b>A place sanctified for blood.</b> |
| Genesis 49:27 | “Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; | Zevachim 54b:9 | The verse following those verses states: <b>“We heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood”</b> (Psalms 132:6). Rava explains the meaning of these words: <b>“In Ephrath”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Joshua, who came from</b> the tribe of <b>Ephraim.</b> This alludes to the fact that David and Samuel were able to locate the highest place in Eretz Yisrael based on the book of Joshua. <b>“We found it in the field of the wood”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Benjamin, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart;</b> in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). A wolf is a wild animal living in the field, and David and Samuel found the location of the Temple in the portion of Benjamin. |
| Genesis 50:5 | in my grave that I have acquired [ kariti ] for me | Chullin 92a:17 | § The Gemara cites homiletical interpretations of other verses that pertain to the leaders of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia. The verse states: <b>“So I bought her [<i>va’ekkereha</i>] to me for fifteen pieces of silver,</b> and a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> of barley” (Hosea 3:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> The term <b><i>kira</i>,</b> which forms the basis of the verb <i>va’ekkereha</i>, <b>is nothing other than language</b> referring to <b>a sale [<i>mekhira</i>], as it is stated</b> that Joseph said: “My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; <b>in my grave that I have acquired [<i>kariti</i>] for me</b> in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5). |
| Genesis 50:5 | which I purchased [ kariti ] for myself, | Rosh Hashanah26a:19 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When I went to the sea towns,</b> I heard that <b>they called a sale <i>kira</i>.</b> And the Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>significance of this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To explain</b> the verse relating to Jacob’s burial plot: “In my grave <b>which I purchased [<i>kariti</i>] for myself,</b> there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5). |
| Genesis 50:5 | in my grave that I have dug [ kariti ] for me | Sotah 13a:8 | The children of Jacob <b>said to</b> Esau: <b>You sold</b> your rights <b>to</b> Jacob. Esau <b>said to them: Though I sold the birthright, did I</b> also <b>sell</b> my rights to the burial site as <b>an ordinary</b> brother?

The Gemara begins its discussion of the burial of Jacob by asking: <b>What is different initially that it is written: “And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,</b> the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 50:7), <b>and afterward</b> it says in the following verse: <b>“And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house;</b> only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen” (Genesis 50:8), indicating that the brothers of Joseph were second in importance to the Egyptians? <b>And what is different at the end that it is written: “And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren,” and afterward</b> it states: <b>“And all that went up with him to bury his father,</b> after he had buried his father” (Genesis 50:14), placing the brothers before the Egyptians? |
| Genesis 50:8 | “And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house; | Sotah 13a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Joseph merited</b> to bury his father, resulting in a display of great honor to his father. The Gemara begins its discussion of the burial of Jacob by asking: <b>What is different initially that it is written: “And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,</b> the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 50:7), <b>and afterward</b> it says in the following verse: <b>“And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house;</b> only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen” (Genesis 50:8), indicating that the brothers of Joseph were second in importance to the Egyptians? <b>And what is different at the end that it is written: “And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren,” and afterward</b> it states: <b>“And all that went up with him to bury his father,</b> after he had buried his father” (Genesis 50:14), placing the brothers before the Egyptians? |
| Genesis 50:10 | written: “And he mourned his father seven days” | Shabbat 152a:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The maggots</b> that eat the flesh of the deceased <b>are as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living, as it says</b> with regard to the dead: <b>“But his flesh is in pain for him,</b> and his soul mourns over him” (Job 14:22). <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person’s soul mourns for him</b> during <b>all seven days</b> of mourning following his death, <b>as it is stated: And his soul mourns over him,” and it is</b> also <b>written: “And he mourned his father seven days”</b> (Genesis 50:10). |
| Genesis 50:10 | As it is written: “And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, | Sotah 13a:4 | The Gemara explains what honor was accorded to the family of Jacob: <b>As it is written: “And they came to the threshing floor of Atad,</b> which is beyond the Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days” (Genesis 50:10). The word atad is the name of the boxthorn bush. <b>And does a boxthorn</b> bush <b>have a threshing floor?</b> Thorns are not collected and eaten. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> This <b>teaches that they surrounded the casket of Jacob with crowns, like this threshing floor that is surrounded with boxthorns, because the children of Esau and the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah</b> all <b>came</b> to the burial of Jacob. |
| Genesis 50:10 | “And there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing” | Sotah 13a:6 | The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s burial. The verse states: <b>“And there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing”</b> (Genesis 50:10). It is <b>taught: Even horses and even donkeys</b> participated in the mourning. |
| Genesis 50:13 | would his brothers not have dealt with it? But isn’t it written: “For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, | Sotah 13a:12 | The Gemara returns to discuss the involvement of Joseph and his brothers in the burial of their father: <b>And if Joseph would not have dealt with</b> the burial of Jacob, <b>would his brothers not have dealt with it? But isn’t it written: “For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan,</b> and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah” (Genesis 50:13)? Since it is evident that the brothers were involved in the burial, why did they not deal with Jacob’s burial needs from the outset? The Gemara answers: <b>They said: Allow</b> Joseph to take care of it, because there is <b>more honor</b> for our father to be prepared for burial <b>by royalty than by common</b> people <b>[<i>hedyotot</i>].</b> |
| Genesis 50:14 | “And all that went up with him to bury his father, | Sotah 13a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Joseph merited</b> to bury his father, resulting in a display of great honor to his father. The Gemara begins its discussion of the burial of Jacob by asking: <b>What is different initially that it is written: “And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,</b> the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 50:7), <b>and afterward</b> it says in the following verse: <b>“And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house;</b> only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen” (Genesis 50:8), indicating that the brothers of Joseph were second in importance to the Egyptians? <b>And what is different at the end that it is written: “And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren,” and afterward</b> it states: <b>“And all that went up with him to bury his father,</b> after he had buried his father” (Genesis 50:14), placing the brothers before the Egyptians? |
| Genesis 50:17 | And now, please | Yoma 87a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who asks forgiveness of his friend should not ask more than three times, as it is stated: “Please, please forgive</b> the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you. <b>And now, please</b> forgive” (Genesis 50:17). The verse uses the word please three times, which shows that one need not ask more than three times, after which the insulted friend must be appeased and forgive. <b>And if</b> the insulted friend <b>dies</b> before he can be appeased, <b>one brings ten people, and stands them at the grave</b> of the insulted friend, <b>and says</b> in front of them: <b>I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and against so-and-so whom I wounded.</b> |
| Genesis 50:18 | “And his brothers even went and fell down before him” | Megillah 16b:5 | Following Jacob’s death, it states concerning Joseph: <b>“And his brothers even went and fell down before him”</b> (Genesis 50:18). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> i.e., if a fox is appointed king, one must bow down before and submit oneself to it. |
| Genesis 50:21 | “And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts” | Megillah 16b:7 | It says with regard to Joseph’s remarks to his brothers: <b>“And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts”</b> (Genesis 50:21). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that he spoke to them words that are acceptable to the heart,</b> and alleviated their fears. This is what he said: <b>If ten lights could not put out one light,</b> as all of you were unable to do me harm, <b>how can one light put out ten lights?</b> |
| Genesis 50:21 | It is written here: “ Vayyinaḥem ,” and it is written there: “And he comforted them [ vayenaḥem otam ] and spoke to their heart” | Sanhedrin 108a:15 | It is written: <b>“<i>Vayyinaḥem</i> the Lord that He made man on the earth [<i>ba’aretz</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:6). The meaning of the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” is subject to a dispute. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> in explanation: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I did well that I prepared graves for</b> people <b>in the earth [<i>ba’aretz</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it <b>inferred</b> that the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” has a positive connotation? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written here: “<i>Vayyinaḥem</i>,” and it is written there: “And he comforted them [<i>vayenaḥem otam</i>] and spoke to their heart”</b> (Genesis 50:21). |
| Genesis 50:25 | On a similar note, you say: “And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, | Ketubot 111a:23 | <b>On a similar note, you say: “And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel,</b> saying: God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> There are <b>inner matters</b> here. <b>Joseph knew concerning himself that he was completely righteous, and if the dead of</b> the lands <b>outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael come <b>alive, why did he trouble his brothers</b> to carry his coffin <b>four hundreds parasangs</b> to Eretz Yisrael? The reason is that he was concerned <b>lest he not merit the tunnels.</b> |
| Genesis 50:25 | during his lifetime, | Sotah 13b:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: For what</b> reason <b>was Joseph called: Bones,</b> even <b>during his lifetime,</b> as he had his brothers take an oath that “God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25)? <b>Because he did not protest for the honor of his father, as</b> the brothers <b>said to</b> Joseph while unaware of his true identity: <b>“Your servant our father”</b> (Genesis 43:28, 44:31), <b>and</b> Joseph <b>said nothing to them</b> in protest that they referred to his father Jacob as Joseph’s servant. |
