| on Job 2:5 | that it brings lament to the world | Yoma 76b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>why does</b> the Bible <b>call</b> it <b>wine</b> and <b>why does it call it <i>tirosh</i>?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>“Wine”</b> suggests <b>that it brings lament to the world</b> because drunkenness causes most sins. There is a phonetic resemblance between the <i>yayin</i>, wine, and <i>ta’aniya va’aniya</i>, sorrow and howling, which Rashi (on Job 2:5) explains as lament. <b>“<i>Tirosh</i>”</b> shows <b>that those who indulge in it become poor [<i>rash</i>].</b> |
