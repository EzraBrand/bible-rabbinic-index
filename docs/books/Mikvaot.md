| Mikvaot 2:2 | Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him, as we learned | Gittin 31b:4 | The mishna teaches that this is <b>the statement of</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> The <i>amora</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found deficient</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it, retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b> |
| Mikvaot 2:2 | ritual bath? As we learned | Kiddushin 79a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of a <b>ritual bath? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of water, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found deficient</b> in its quantity of water, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>All pure items whose</b> purification <b>had been performed in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b> This indicates that the current situation, i.e., the deficient ritual bath, is presumed to extend back until when it was known with certainty to have contained the requisite amount of water. In this case too, the woman should be considered a grown woman at the time of the first betrothal, and the second betrothal should not take effect. |
| Mikvaot 2:2 | As we learned | Niddah 2b:17 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is located <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b> |
| Mikvaot 2:2 | a ritual bath? As we learned | Niddah 2b:2 | With regard to the opinions of both Shammai and Hillel, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>a ritual bath? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b> |
| Mikvaot 3:3 | learned | Chagigah 19a:21 | Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: You</b> already <b>learned</b> it in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 3:3): If there are <b>three depressions in</b> the bed of <b>a stream that</b> are not completely dry, <b>an upper one, a lower one, and a middle one;</b> and <b>the upper and lower ones</b> hold <b>twenty <i>se’a</i> each, while the middle one</b> contains <b>forty <i>se’a</i>, and a flow of rain runs between them,</b> thereby linking the depressions one to another, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> My colleague, Rabbi <b>Meir, would say:</b> One may <b>immerse in the upper one.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Meir holds that the waters of the middle depression, which contains the requisite amount of water for a ritual bath, are considered to have ascended by means of the rainwater into the higher depression. Since Rabbi Yehuda cites his colleague’s statement without comment, he evidently accepts the principle of raising the partition. |
| Mikvaot 3:4 | Rav Pappa says: They said | Gittin 16a:7 | Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa says: They said</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 3:4): In the case of <b>a sick</b> person <b>who experienced a seminal emission, who had nine <i>kav</i> of</b> drawn <b>water poured over him,</b> this is sufficient to render him <b>ritually pure.</b> He need not immerse himself in a ritual bath. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>half of him</b> is purified <b>by immersion and half of him through</b> this act of <b>pouring, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No answer is found for this dilemma either, and the Gemara says that it <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Mikvaot 5:6 | As we learned | Chagigah 19a:1 | whereas <b>here,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to tithes,</b> for which intention to purify oneself is required. <b>And from where do you say</b> this, <b>that non-sacred</b> food <b>does not require</b> the <b>intention</b> that one is purifying himself for the sake of eating it? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 5:6): If <b>a wave containing forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>became detached</b> from the sea <b>and fell on a person or on vessels, they are ritually pure.</b> The mishna <b>teaches that a person is similar to vessels: Just as vessels do not intend</b> to be purified, as they obviously harbor no intentions, <b>so too,</b> the case of <b>a person</b> is referring to a situation <b>in</b> which <b>he does not intend</b> to purify himself, thereby implying that people can be ritually purified even without intention. |
| Mikvaot 5:6 | as we learned | Chullin 31a:20 | Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The halakhic status of <b>her husband is non-sacred, and non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent</b> for purification. <b>And from where do you say</b> so? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 5:6): In the case of <b>a wave that was detached</b> from the sea, <b>and in it</b> were <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and</b> that wave <b>fell on</b> an impure <b>person or on</b> impure <b>vessels, they are ritually pure. What, is it not</b> that <b>a person</b> is <b>similar to vessels? Just as vessels do not intend</b> to be purified and they are purified by the wave, <b>so too, a person does not require intent</b> in order to be purified. |
| Mikvaot 6:2 | as we learned | Chagigah 22a:8 | We know this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 6:2): With regard to <b>vessels that one filled with</b> other <b>vessels and immersed them</b> all together, <b>they are pure,</b> regardless of the width of the opening of the outer vessel. <b>And if he did not immerse, the joining of waters</b> is not effective <b>until they are joined like the</b> width of the <b>tube of a wineskin.</b> This second sentence of the mishna is unclear, and the Gemara seeks to clarify it. <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying</b> here when it says: <b>And if he did not immerse?</b> The Gemara explains. <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: And if he has no need to immerse</b> the outer vessel, as it was already pure, <b>and</b> similarly in a case of two bodies of <b>water</b> that are <b>joined</b> together by means of a hole, it is not valid <b>until</b> the water <b>is joined</b> through a space as wide <b>as the tube of a wineskin.</b> |
| Mikvaot 6:7 | as we learned | Chagigah 21b:4 | <b>Rava</b> disagreed with Rabbi Ila. He <b>said</b> that <b>since</b> the reason for the stringency in <b>the latter clause is due to</b> concern for interposition, this implies that the reason for the stringency in <b>the first clause is not due to interposition,</b> but to a different reason. <b>And</b> with regard to the stringency in <b>the first clause</b> that one may not immerse one vessel within another, <b>this is the reasoning:</b> It is <b>a</b> rabbinic <b>decree</b> to ensure <b>that one not immerse</b> small vessels, such as <b>needles and hooks, inside a vessel whose mouth</b> is less than the width of <b>the tube of a wineskin.</b> In such a case the water in the bottle would not be considered attached to the rest of the ritual bath, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 6:7): <b>The joining of</b> different bodies of water in cases of <b>ritual baths</b> takes place if the opening between the two bodies is at least as wide <b>as</b> the width of <b>the tube of a wineskin,</b> counting both the <b>thickness</b> of the wall of the tube |
| Mikvaot 7:2 | Didn’t we learn | Yevamot 82b:4 | The Gemara raises another objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>But</b> does <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan maintain</b> that <b>with regard to</b> a mixture containing an item that is forbidden <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>we do not require</b> the permitted portion of the mixture to be <b>greater</b> in quantity so that it can nullify the prohibited part? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> otherwise in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>a ritual bath that contains exactly forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, the minimal measure of a fit ritual bath, and <b>one added</b> to it <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of liquid other than water, <b>and</b> then <b>removed</b> from it <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of the mixture, the ritual bath remains <b>fit,</b> as the liquid that was added was nullified in the forty <i>se’a</i> of water, so that when one <i>se’a</i> of the mixture was removed there still remained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of fit water. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>up to the greater part</b> of the ritual bath. |
| Mikvaot 7:2 | one added a se’a and removed a se’a , as we learned | Zevachim 22a:12 | <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The statement of Reish Lakish means <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>one added a <i>se’a</i> and removed a <i>se’a</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that contains</b> the minimum measure of <b>exactly forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, and <b>one added a <i>se’a</i></b> of liquid other than water, <b>and</b> then <b>removed a <i>se’a</i></b> of the mixture, the ritual bath remains <b>fit.</b> The added liquid is considered nullified in the forty <i>se’a</i> of water, so that when one <i>se’a</i> of the mixture is removed, there still remain the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of fit water. <b>And Rav Yehuda bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>up to the greater part</b> of the measure of the ritual bath. Adding and removing such a liquid to the requisite measure for washing of the hands renders the water unfit. |
| Mikvaot 7:3 | dye water, as we learned | Makkot 3b:16 | § <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water into which one sixty-fourth of a <i>log</i> [<i>kortov</i>]</b> of <b>wine fell, and the color of</b> the water <b>is like the color of wine, and</b> that liquid <b>fell into a ritual bath</b> containing less than forty <i>se’a</i>, although the Sages ruled that three <i>log</i> of drawn water invalidate a ritual bath, in this case the liquid <b>does not invalidate it,</b> because the halakhic status of the liquid that fell into the ritual bath is that of wine, and wine does not invalidate a ritual bath. <b>Rav Kahana objects to this: And what</b> is the difference <b>between this</b> case of water into which wine fell <b>and</b> the case of <b>dye water, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:3): <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Dye water in</b> the amount of <b>three <i>log</i> invalidates a ritual bath?</b> The wine, like the dye, colors the water. <b>Rava said to him:</b> The difference is that <b>there</b> the mixture <b>is called dye water,</b> where the water maintains the status of water; <b>here it is called diluted wine.</b> |
| Mikvaot 7:5 | Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as we learned | Chullin 26a:4 | <b>Rava said:</b> It is not necessary to understand the mishna specifically in that manner; rather, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:5): In a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water less one sixty-fourth of a <i>log</i> [<i>kortov</i>],</b> or any small measure of water, <b>into which a <i>kortov</i> of wine fell,</b> increasing the measure of liquid to a total of three <i>log</i>, <b>and the appearance of</b> those three <i>log</i> is <b>like the appearance of wine, and</b> then those three <i>log</i> <b>fell into a ritual bath,</b> completing its requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>it has not invalidated</b> the ritual bath. The reason is that three <i>log</i> of drawn water invalidate the ritual bath, and less than that measure of water fell into the ritual bath. |
| Mikvaot 7:5 | As we learned | Makkot 3b:17 | The Gemara asks with regard to Rav’s statement: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> that three <i>log</i> of water into which a <i>kortov</i> of wine fell <b>reduce the ritual bath</b> into a state where it is no longer valid? <b>Rava said</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement of Rav is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> taught by Rabbi Ḥiyya is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:5): In a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water</b> |
| Mikvaot 7:6 | Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned | Chagigah 19a:16 | In relation to the above, the Gemara explains: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that one <b>whose foot is still in the water</b> is considered to be still immersing himself? <b>Rabbi Pedat said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:6): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that was measured and</b> found to <b>contain exactly forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and</b> then <b>two</b> individuals <b>descended and immersed one after the other, the first one is ritually pure,</b> since he immersed in a valid ritual bath, <b>but the second is ritually impure.</b> Because a small amount of water clings to the first individual, the ritual bath subsequently holds less than the requisite amount. Therefore, it does not purify the second individual. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: If the feet of the first one were</b> still <b>touching the water,</b> so that he had not yet exited the ritual bath entirely while the second one immersed, <b>the second is also ritually pure.</b> This teaches that Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that one who still has a foot in the water is considered to be inside the ritual bath. |
| Mikvaot 7:6 | Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned | Gittin 16a:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> that liquid rendered an item moist enough to render another item moist joins with other liquid is stated only <b>with regard to the issue of ritual baths, and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:6): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that contains precisely forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and two</b> people <b>descended and immersed</b> in it, if <b>both of them</b> immersed <b>at the same time they are ritually pure.</b> |
| Mikvaot 8:3 | raises an objection | Niddah 43a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): If one <b>was having</b> sexual <b>thoughts at night and he arose and found</b> that <b>his flesh</b> was <b>warm, he is ritually impure,</b> despite the fact that he did not sense the emission of semen. This shows that the impurity of a seminal emission applies even if one did not feel it in his entire body. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna interpreted</b> this mishna as referring <b>to</b> one who <b>engaged in intercourse in his dream. Since it is impossible to engage in intercourse without</b> the accompanying <b>sensation,</b> he certainly must have felt it, despite the fact that he was unaware of this when he awoke. |
| Mikvaot 8:3 | hear | Niddah 43a:14 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> and <b>who</b> subsequently <b>immersed but did not urinate</b> before doing so, <b>when he</b> later <b>urinates</b> he is rendered <b>impure,</b> as some semen will also be emitted. The reason that he is rendered impure by this emission, which he does not sense, must be because the uprooting of the semen was accompanied by a sensation. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as the majority</b> of the semen <b>emerged</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation,</b> and therefore he is rendered impure by this small amount even without a sensation. |
| Mikvaot 8:4 | there | Chullin 24b:3 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:4): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission who</b> then <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and did not urinate</b> before immersing, <b>when he urinates he is ritually impure,</b> because residue of the semen remain in his body and was discharged with the urine, rendering him impure. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In</b> the case of <b>an ill</b> person <b>and an elderly</b> person, he is <b>ritually impure; in</b> the case of <b>a young</b> person <b>and a healthy</b> person, he is <b>ritually pure,</b> as the semen was presumably discharged in its entirety at the outset. |
| Mikvaot 8:4 | Let us say | Niddah 34a:13 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:4) <b>supports</b> Rava’s opinion: In the case of <b>a gentile woman who discharged semen</b> that came <b>from a Jew</b> who engaged in intercourse with her, the semen is <b>impure,</b> as it came from a Jew. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a Jewish woman who discharged semen</b> that came <b>from a gentile,</b> the semen is <b>pure. What, is it not</b> correct to say that the mishna means the semen of the gentile is <b>entirely pure,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rava? The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>No,</b> perhaps the mishna means that the semen of a gentile is <b>pure by Torah law</b> but <b>impure by rabbinic law,</b> whereas according to Rava, the semen of a gentile is pure even by rabbinic law. |
| Mikvaot 10:5 | Rabbi Meir, as we learned | Chullin 73a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with</b> whose opinion is this halakhic principle that Ravina cites? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:5): When a vessel is immersed in a ritual bath, it is purified only if all parts of the vessel are submerged at the same time. But with regard to <b>any handles of vessels that are</b> too <b>long and</b> therefore <b>will ultimately be cut off, one</b> must <b>immerse them</b> only <b>until the point of</b> their eventual <b>size.</b> Even though the part of the handle that will be cut off is not submerged, the vessel is nevertheless purified; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Meir holds that even though the handle is still physically attached, since that part of the handle stands to be cut off, it is already regarded as though it were cut off. Consequently, immersing the handle up until that point is regarded as immersing the entire vessel. |
| Mikvaot 10:8 | as we learned | Chullin 71b:12 | Rava elaborates: With regard to <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:8): If someone <b>swallowed a ring</b> that was <b>impure</b> due to having been in contact with a corpse, he is thereby rendered impure. To render himself pure <b>he immerses and</b> then <b>he may partake of his <i>teruma</i>,</b> despite the fact that the impure ring is still inside him. The reason this is permitted is that since the ring in encapsulated inside the person’s body it cannot impart impurity. If <b>he vomited</b> out this ring it remains <b>impure,</b> as it was not purified by his immersion, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it renders him impure</b> upon its exit from his body. |
| Mikvaot 10:8 | as we learn | Chullin 71b:13 | Likewise, <b>we learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an encapsulated pure</b> item cannot be rendered impure, <b>as we learn</b> in the same mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:8): If one <b>swallowed a ritually pure ring and</b> then <b>entered a tent containing a corpse,</b> thereby contracting impurity, <b>and</b> then in order to render him pure someone <b>sprinkled</b> upon him the water that is mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, once on the third day <b>and again</b> on the seventh day as required, <b>and</b> then <b>he immersed,</b> thereby completing the purification process; <b>and</b> then <b>he vomited</b> out the ring, the ring <b>is</b> pure <b>as it</b> always <b>was,</b> i.e., it was not rendered impure from the corpse. |
