| Psalms 1:1 | which is written: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful” | Avodah Zarah18b:11 | § Apropos the earlier discussion of the evils of scornfulness, the Talmud cites several statements that criticize such behavior. <b>R' Shimon ben Pazi taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1)? <b>Since he did not walk</b> in the counsel of the wicked, <b>how</b> could <b>he stand</b> with them? <b>And since he did not stand, how</b> could <b>he sit</b> with them? <b>And since he did not sit</b> with them, <b>how</b> could <b>he</b> have <b>scorned? </b> Since he never joined the company of the wicked, he would have no reason to be involved with them in any manner. |
| Psalms 1:1 | Rabbi Yonatan says: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked” | Avodah Zarah18b:18 | § The Talmud relates an alternative homiletic interpretation of the verse discussed above. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 1:1); <b>this</b> |
| Psalms 1:1 | “Nor stood in the way of sinners” | Avodah Zarah19a:1 | is referring to <b>our forefather Abraham, who did not walk in the counsel of the members of the generation of the dispersion, who were wicked, as it is stated</b> that they said to each other: <b>“Come, let us build us a city, </b> and a tower, with its top in heaven” (Genesis 11:4), a project with a wicked aim. <b>“Nor stood in the way of sinners”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this too is referring to Abraham, <b>who did not join in the stand of</b> the residents of <b>Sodom, who were sinners, as it is stated: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against YHWH exceedingly”</b> (Genesis 13:13). |
| Psalms 1:1 | “Nor sat in the seat of the scornful” | Avodah Zarah19a:2 | <b>“Nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this means <b>that</b> Abraham <b>did not sit in the seat of the Philistines, because they were scorners</b> who engaged in jest and buffoonery. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Philistines in a later period: <b>“And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: Call for Samson, that he may make us sport”</b> (Judges 16:25). |
| Psalms 1:1 | Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is.” He opened with “happy is,” as it is written: “Happy is the man | Berakhot 10a:1 | <b>Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is. ” He opened with “happy is, ” as it is written: “Happy is the man</b> who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked or stood in the way of sinners or sat in the dwelling place of the scornful” (Psalms 1:1). <b>And he concluded with “happy, ” as it is written</b> at the end of the chapter: “Pay homage in purity, lest He be angry, and you perish on the way when His anger is kindled suddenly. <b>Happy are those who take refuge in Him”</b> (Psalms 2:12). We see that these two chapters actually constitute a single chapter. |
| Psalms 1:1 | as it is stated: “Nor sat in the seat of the scornful” | Kiddushin 41a:1 | <b>has managed</b> to acquire <b>only anger [<i>ragzanuta</i>], </b> i.e., nothing beneficial comes through anger; in the end he is left with nothing but the anger itself. <b>And a good person is given the fruit of his actions to taste. And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> person <b>who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishnah, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior, </b> one should <b>vow to not</b> derive <b>benefit from him, </b> and one should have no contact with him, <b>as it is stated: “Nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1). The <b>seat</b> of this person is certainly the <b>seat of the scornful, </b> as he is engaged in nothing but idle matters. |
| Psalms 1:2 | Lest a person say: Since I did not go to theaters and circuses, and did not stand in bestial contests, I will go and indulge in sleep, the verse states: “And he meditates in His law day and night” | Avodah Zarah18b:17 | <b>Lest a person say: Since I did not go to theaters and circuses, and did not stand in bestial contests, I will go and indulge in sleep, the verse states: “And he meditates in His law day and night”</b> (Psalms 1:2). This demonstrates that it is not sufficient simply to avoid transgressions; rather, it is necessary to engage actively in Torah study. |
| Psalms 1:2 | “But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord” | Avodah Zarah19a:5 | § The Talmud returns to its interpretation of the verse that was discussed previously: <b>“But his delight is in the Torah of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 1:2). <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A person can learn Torah only from a place</b> in the Torah <b>that his heart desires, as it is stated: But his delight is in the Torah of YHWH, </b> i.e., his delight is in the part of the Torah that he wishes to study. |
| Psalms 1:2 | and in his Torah he meditates day and night” | Kiddushin 32b:1 | By contrast, <b>here, is it his Torah, </b> that the teacher can forgo its honor? <b>Rava then said: Yes, </b> if he studies, <b>it is his Torah, as it is written: </b> “For his delight is the Torah of YHWH, <b>and in his Torah he meditates day and night”</b> (Psalms 1:2). This indicates that at first it is “the Torah of YHWH,” but after he studies, it becomes “his Torah. ” |
| Psalms 1:3 | “And he shall be like a tree planted [ shatul ] by streams of water” | Avodah Zarah19a:18 | § The Talmud returns to its interpretation of the first verses of Psalms. <b>“And he shall be like a tree planted [<i>shatul</i>] by streams of water”</b> (Psalms 1:3). The students of <b>the school of R' Yannai say: </b> The verse states that a Torah scholar <b>is comparable to a tree</b> that has been uprooted from its original location and <b>replanted [<i>shatul</i>]</b> somewhere else. It does <b>not</b> say that he <b>is comparable to a tree that is planted [<i>natu’a</i>]</b> and remains in one place. This is teaching that <b>anyone who learns Torah from one teacher</b> alone <b>never sees a sign of blessing, </b> as it is necessary to acquire knowledge from many teachers. |
| Psalms 1:3 | “By streams [ palgei ] of water” | Avodah Zarah19b:1 | <b>he will not</b> become confused by the <b>different versions</b> of the same statements he hears from each teacher, as he will have no clear authoritative version from one source. The Talmud continues discussing the verse cited above: <b>“By streams [<i>palgei</i>] of water”</b> (Psalms 1:3). <b>R' Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: </b> Since the root <i>peh</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>gimmel</i> can also refer to dividing, the verse is interpreted as follows: <b>A person should always divide his years into thirds, </b> as follows: <b>One 3rd for Bible, one 3rd for Mishnah</b> and <b>one 3rd for Talmud. </b> |
| Psalms 1:3 | “That brings forth its fruit in its season | Avodah Zarah19b:3 | The Talmud discusses the continuation of the verse cited above: <b>“That brings forth its fruit in its season</b> and whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rava says: If one brings forth fruit in its season, </b> i.e., if he acts in accordance with the precepts of Torah that he learns, then <b>his leaf will not wither, </b> as the Torah will sustain him. <b>But if</b> one does <b>not</b> learn with the intention that his studies should lead to action, then <b>with regard to</b> both <b>the one who is taught and with regard to the one who teaches, the verse states about them: “Not so the wicked; but</b> they are like the chaff that the wind drives away” (Psalms 1:4). |
| Psalms 1:3 | “And whose leaf does not wither” | Avodah Zarah19b:6 | The Talmud cites another discussion with regard to the aforementioned verse: <b>“And whose leaf does not wither”</b> (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> One should know <b>that even</b> the <b>ordinary conversation of Torah scholars require analysis, as it is stated: “And whose leaf does not wither. ”</b> This teaches that even the ordinary conversation of a Torah scholar, which is comparable to the leaves of a tree, has great significance like the actual fruit of the tree. |
| Psalms 1:3 | who brings forth his fruit in his season” | Bava Kamma82a:10 | The Talmud explains the next listed ordinance: <b>And that one should eat garlic Shabbat eve. </b> This is <b>due to</b> the fact that garlic enhances sexual potency, and Friday night is an appropriate time for <b>sex. As it is written</b> concerning the righteous: “And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <b>who brings forth his fruit in his season”</b> (Psalms 1:3); <b>and R' Yehuda says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>This</b> is referring to <b>one who has sex every Shabbat eve. </b> |
| Psalms 1:3 | “that brings forth its fruit in its season” | Ketubot 62b:5 | § <b>When</b> is <b>the</b> ideal <b>time for Torah scholars</b> to fulfill their conjugal obligations? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: </b> The appropriate time for them is <b>from Shabbat eve to Shabbat eve, </b> i.e., on Friday nights. Similarly, it is stated with regard to the verse <b>“that brings forth its fruit in its season”</b> (Psalms 1:3): <b>Rav Yehuda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Huna, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Naḥman: This</b> is referring to one <b>who engages in marital sex, </b> bringing forth his fruit, <b>from Shabbat eve to Shabbat eve. </b> |
| Psalms 1:3 | and whose leaf does not wither” | Sukkah 21b:9 | The Talmud questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And let</b> R' Shimon <b>say: From the statement of Rabban Gamliel. </b> Why did he use the atypical expression: From the conversation of Rabban Gamliel? The Talmud answers: Through this expression <b>he teaches us</b> another matter <b>in passing, like that which R' Aḥa bar Adda said, and some say</b> that <b>R' Aḥa bar Adda said</b> that <b>R' Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even</b> the <b>conversation of Torah scholars require analysis, </b> even when the intention of the speaker was apparently not to issue a halakhic ruling? It is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the righteous: “Which brings forth its fruit in its season <b>and whose leaf does not wither”</b> (Psalms 1:3). This teaches that with regard to a Torah scholar, not only is his primary product, his fruit, significant but even ancillary matters that stem from his conversation, his leaves, are significant. |
| Psalms 1:4 | the one who is taught and with regard to the one who teaches, the verse states about them: “Not so the wicked; but | Avodah Zarah19b:3 | The Talmud discusses the continuation of the verse cited above: <b>“That brings forth its fruit in its season</b> and whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rava says: If one brings forth fruit in its season, </b> i.e., if he acts in accordance with the precepts of Torah that he learns, then <b>his leaf will not wither, </b> as the Torah will sustain him. <b>But if</b> one does <b>not</b> learn with the intention that his studies should lead to action, then <b>with regard to</b> both <b>the one who is taught and with regard to the one who teaches, the verse states about them: “Not so the wicked; but</b> they are like the chaff that the wind drives away” (Psalms 1:4). |
| Psalms 1:5 | in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous” | Sanhedrin 108a:1 | <b>in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 1:5). <b>“Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment”; this</b> is referring to <b>the generation of the flood, </b> about whom it is written: “The wickedness of man was great upon the earth” (Genesis 6:5). <b>“Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”; these are the people of Sodom, </b> about whom it is written: “And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners” (Genesis 13:13). The rabbis <b>said to</b> R' Neḥemya: <b>They will not stand</b> in judgment for resurrection <b>in the congregation of the righteous, but they will stand</b> in judgment <b>in the congregation of the wicked. </b> |
| Psalms 2:3 | kick his sukka and leave, as it is stated: “Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us” | Avodah Zarah3a:13 | <b>Immediately, each and every</b> non-Jew will <b>take</b> materials <b>and go and construct a <i>sukka</i> on top of his roof. And God, </b> will <b>set upon them the heat [<i>makdir</i>] of the sun in the season of Tammuz, </b> i.e., the summer, <b>and each and every one</b> who is sitting in his <i>sukka</i> will be unable to stand the heat, and he will <b>kick his <i>sukka</i> and leave, as it is stated: “Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us”</b> (Psalms 2:3). The Talmud asks: Why does God <b>heat</b> the sun over them? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>God does not deal tyrannically with His creations? </b> The Talmud answers: This is not considered dealing tyrannically with the non-Jews, <b>because for the Jewish people as well, </b> there are <b>times</b> |
| Psalms 2:3 | a mitzva and leave, as it is stated: “Let us tear their bands asunder, | Avodah Zarah3b:6 | <b>And</b> then <b>every one</b> of these converts will <b>tear loose his</b> sign of performance of <b>a mitzva and leave, as it is stated: “Let us tear their bands asunder, </b> and cast away their cords from us” (Psalms 2:3). <b>And God sits and makes sport, </b> i.e., laughs or rejoices, <b>as it is stated: “He that sits in heaven makes sport, </b> YHWH has them in derision” (Psalms 2:4). <b>R' Yitzḥak says: There is no making sport for God but on that day alone. </b> |
| Psalms 2:4 | as it is stated: “He that sits in heaven makes sport, | Avodah Zarah3b:2 | The Talmud resumes its narration: <b>Immediately, God sits and makes sport of</b> those non-Jews, i.e., He laughs at them, <b>as it is stated: “He that sits in heaven makes sport, </b> YHWH has them in derision” (Psalms 2:4). With regard to this verse, <b>R' Yitzḥak says: There is no making sport for God but on that day alone. </b> |
| Psalms 2:4 | as it is stated: “He that sits in heaven makes sport, | Avodah Zarah3b:6 | <b>And</b> then <b>every one</b> of these converts will <b>tear loose his</b> sign of performance of <b>a mitzva and leave, as it is stated: “Let us tear their bands asunder, </b> and cast away their cords from us” (Psalms 2:3). <b>And God sits and makes sport, </b> i.e., laughs or rejoices, <b>as it is stated: “He that sits in heaven makes sport, </b> YHWH has them in derision” (Psalms 2:4). <b>R' Yitzḥak says: There is no making sport for God but on that day alone. </b> |
| Psalms 2:11 | “Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice with trembling” | Berakhot 30b:19 | The Talmud rejects this too: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps, actually I would say to you</b> that it should be read as it is written: <b>Specifically, “in the beauty, ”</b> and it means that one should pray in beautiful clothing, <b>as</b> in the case <b>of Rav Yehuda who would adorn himself and then pray. </b> Rav Yehuda believed that one who comes before the King must wear his most beautiful clothing. The Talmud has yet to find a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one must approach prayer from an atmosphere of gravity. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> it can be derived <b>from here, </b> from this verse: <b>“Serve YHWH in fear and rejoice with trembling”</b> (Psalms 2:11). |
| Psalms 2:11 | so that the Torah would be delivered with reverence, with quaking and with trembling, as it is stated: “Serve the Lord with awe, and rejoice with trembling” | Yoma 4b:2 | <b>R' Matya ben Ḥarash says: The verse</b> calling Moses into the cloud <b>comes only to intimidate</b> Moses, to instill in him a sense of awe of the Creator, <b>so that the Torah would be delivered with reverence, with quaking and with trembling, as it is stated: “Serve YHWH with awe, and rejoice with trembling”</b> (Psalms 2:11). Apropos the end of the verse, the Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“and rejoice with trembling”? </b> Joy and trembling seem contradictory. <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Rav said: Where there is</b> the <b>joy of</b> fulfilling a mitzva, <b>there will be</b> the <b>trembling</b> of the awe of Heaven <b>there. </b> |
| Psalms 2:12 | Happy are those who take refuge in Him” | Berakhot 10a:1 | <b>Every chapter that was dear to David, he began with “happy is” and concluded with “happy is. ” He opened with “happy is, ” as it is written: “Happy is the man</b> who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked or stood in the way of sinners or sat in the dwelling place of the scornful” (Psalms 1:1). <b>And he concluded with “happy, ” as it is written</b> at the end of the chapter: “Pay homage in purity, lest He be angry, and you perish on the way when His anger is kindled suddenly. <b>Happy are those who take refuge in Him”</b> (Psalms 2:12). We see that these two chapters actually constitute a single chapter. |
| Psalms 2:12 | nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Pay homage to bar lest He be angry” | Sanhedrin 92a:1 | <b>the people [<i>leom</i>] shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>], </b> but blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides” (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And</b> the term <b><i>leom</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than fetuses, as it is stated: </b> “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your bowels; <b>and the one <i>leom</i> shall overcome the other <i>leom</i>”</b> (Genesis 25:23). <b>And <i>kabbo</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than curse, as it is stated</b> in the statement of Balaam: <b>“How can I curse one who is not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>] by God? ”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>bar</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Pay homage to <i>bar</i> lest He be angry”</b> (Psalms 2:12), i.e., observe the Torah to avoid God’s wrath. |
| Psalms 3:1 | A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom” | Berakhot 10a:8 | In explaining passages from Psalms, the Talmud relates another instance of a response to the question of a heretic: <b>A certain heretic said to R' Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1), <b>and</b> similarly <b>it is said: </b> “To the chief musician, <i>al tashḥet</i>, <b>a <i>mikhtam</i> of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave”</b> (Psalms 57:1). <b>Which event was first? Since the event with Saul was first, </b> it would have been appropriate <b>to write it first. </b> |
| Psalms 3:1 | As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom” | Berakhot 7b:11 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said</b> other aggadic statements <b>in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: </b> The existence of <b>wayward</b> children <b>in a person’s home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog, </b> the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. <b>As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1). <b>And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me”</b> (Psalms 3:2). <b>While concerning the war of Gog and Magog, </b> which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, <b>it is written: “Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught? </b> The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against YHWH, and against His anointed…He that sits in heaven laughs, YHWH mocks them” (Psalms 2:1–4). <b>Yet</b> in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog <b>“how numerous are my enemies” is not written, </b> as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom. |
| Psalms 3:2 | And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me” | Berakhot 7b:11 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said</b> other aggadic statements <b>in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: </b> The existence of <b>wayward</b> children <b>in a person’s home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog, </b> the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. <b>As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1). <b>And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me”</b> (Psalms 3:2). <b>While concerning the war of Gog and Magog, </b> which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, <b>it is written: “Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught? </b> The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against YHWH, and against His anointed…He that sits in heaven laughs, YHWH mocks them” (Psalms 2:1–4). <b>Yet</b> in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog <b>“how numerous are my enemies” is not written, </b> as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom. |
| Psalms 3:8 | And that is what is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked” | Berakhot 54b:5 | Og <b>wanted to remove it</b> from his head; <b>his teeth were extended to one side</b> of his head <b>and to the other and he was unable to</b> remove it. <b>And that is what is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8). <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the homiletic interpretation of <b>R' Shimon Ben Lakish, as R' Shimon Ben Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “You break the teeth of the wicked”? Do not read</b> it as: <b>You break [<i>shibarta</i>], but rather</b> as: <b>You lengthened [<i>shirbavta</i>]. </b> |
| Psalms 3:8 | And so too, you find with the teeth of the wicked, as it is written: “You have broken the teeth of the wicked” | Megillah 15b:10 | <b>How much</b> was it stretched? <b>R' Yirmeya said: </b> The scepter <b>was two cubits, and he made it twelve</b> cubits. <b>And some say</b> that he made it <b>sixteen</b> cubits, <b>and</b> yet <b>others say twenty-four</b> cubits. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: </b> He made it <b>sixty</b> cubits. <b>And similarly you find with the arm of Pharaoh’s daughter, </b> which she stretched out to take Moshe. <b>And so too, you find with the teeth of the wicked, as it is written: “You have broken the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8), with regard to which <b>Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> it as <b>“You have broken [<i>shibbarta</i>], ” but</b> as: <b>You have enlarged [<i>sheribavta</i>]. Rabba bar Oferan said in the name of R' Elazar, who heard it from his teacher, who</b> in turn heard it <b>from his teacher: </b> The scepter was stretched <b>two hundred</b> cubits. |
| Psalms 3:8 | and similarly you find with regard to the teeth of evildoers, as it is written: “You have broken [ shibbarta ] the teeth of the wicked” | Sotah 12b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that it means <b>her hand, let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> explicitly: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>]. </b> Why use the more unusual term <i>amatah</i>? The Talmud answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches us that her arm extended [<i>ishtarbav</i>]</b> many cubits. <b>As the Master said</b> in another context: <b>And similarly you find with regard to the hand of Pharaoh’s daughter</b> that it extended, <b>and similarly you find with regard to the teeth of evildoers, as it is written: “You have broken [<i>shibbarta</i>] the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8), <b>and Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shibbarta</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>sheribbavta</i>, </b> you have extended. |
| Psalms 3:9 | “Salvation belongs to the Lord; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela” | Shevuot 15b:10 | <b>And they recited</b> the psalm from the verse: <b>“He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of God”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>until</b> they completed the verse: <b>“Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation”</b> (Psalms 91:9). <b>And they would then recite</b> Psalms, chapter 3, which begins: <b>“A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how many are my enemies become, ” until</b> they reached the verse: <b>“Salvation belongs to YHWH; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela”</b> (Psalms 3:9), which is the end of that psalm. |
| Psalms 4:5 | “Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, Selah” | Berakhot 4b:27 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: Even though one recited <i>Shema</i> in the synagogue, it is a mitzva to recite it upon his bed</b> in fulfillment of the verse: “When you lie down. ” <b>R' Yosei said: What verse</b> alludes to the fact that one must recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening, upon his bed, as well? <b>“Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, Selah”</b> (Psalms 4:5). This is understood to mean: Recite <i>Shema</i>, about which it is written, “on your hearts,” upon your bed, and afterward be still and sleep. |
| Psalms 5:4 | with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward” | Berakhot 6b:28 | <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> said: One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering”</b> (Psalms 141:2). <b><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward”</b> (Psalms 5:4). |
| Psalms 5:5 | and He brought them down to earth. He said before Him: Master of the Universe, “You are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You” | Chagigah 12b:11 | The Talmud asks a question: With regard to <b>these</b> things listed above, are they <b>located in heaven? </b> It is obvious that <b>they</b> are <b>located on the earth. As it is written: “Praise YHWH from the earth, sea monsters and all depths, fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind, fulfilling His word”</b> (Psalms 148:7–8). The verse seems to indicate that all these things are found on the earth. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: David requested mercy with regard to them, </b> that they should not remain in heaven, <b>and He brought them down to earth. He said before Him: God!, “You are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5). In other words, <b>You are righteous, O Lord. </b> Nothing <b>evil should sojourn in Your vicinity. </b> Rather, it is better that they remain close to us. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> this place <b>is called “heaven”? As it is written: “And You shall hear</b> in <b>heaven, the <i>Makhon</i> of Your dwelling”</b> (I Kings 8:39). |
| Psalms 5:5 | the group of slanderers, as it is stated: “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil shall not dwell with You” | Sanhedrin 103a:12 | Apropos the previous statement, the Talmud cites an additional statement. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>four groups do not receive the Shekhina: </b> This pertains to <b>the group of cynics, the group of liars, the group of flatterers, </b> and <b>the group of slanderers. </b> This pertains to <b>the group of cynics, as it is written: “He withdrew His hand with cynics”</b> (Hosea 7:5), indicating that God distanced Himself from them. This pertains to <b>the group of liars, as it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7). This pertains to <b>the group of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer shall not come before Him”</b> (Job 13:16). This pertains to <b>the group of slanderers, as it is stated: “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil shall not dwell with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), which means: <b>You are righteous, and there will be no</b> form of <b>evil in Your dwelling. </b> |
| Psalms 5:5 | not good other than evil. And it says: “For You are not a God that desires wickedness, evil will not dwell with You” | Shabbat 149b:9 | <b>Rather, </b> the basis for this idea is <b>from here: “Punishment is also not good for the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 17:26), meaning that it is not good for a righteous person to issue punishment. <b>There is no</b> meaning of <b>not good other than evil. And it says: “For You are not a God that desires wickedness, evil will not dwell with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), meaning that <b>You, God, are righteous and evil shall not dwell</b> with You <b>in Your place of dwelling. </b> Even a righteous person who punishes someone and is called evil and cannot dwell within God’s partition. |
| Psalms 5:5 | as it is written: “For You are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You” | Sotah 42a:6 | <b>The class of slanderers</b> will not greet the Shekhina, <b>as it is written: “For You are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), which means: <b>You, YHWH, are righteous</b> and <b>evil shall not dwell</b> with You <b>in Your dwelling place. </b> “Evil” here is referring to slanderers, as is evident from the continuation of the chapter, which states: “For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open tomb, they make smooth their tongue” (Psalms 5:10). |
| Psalms 5:8 | “But as for me, by Your abundant loving-kindness I will enter Your house, at Your Holy Temple I will bow in reverence for You” | Berakhot 30b:17 | <b>Rather, R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, said, </b> it can be proved <b>from here, </b> as David said: <b>“But as for me, by Your abundant loving-kindness I will enter Your house, at Your Holy Temple I will bow in reverence for You”</b> (Psalms 5:8). Entering into prayer like entering the Holy Temple must be performed reverentially. |
| Psalms 5:10 | in Your dwelling place. | Sotah 42a:6 | <b>The class of slanderers</b> will not greet the Shekhina, <b>as it is written: “For You are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), which means: <b>You, YHWH, are righteous</b> and <b>evil shall not dwell</b> with You <b>in Your dwelling place. </b> “Evil” here is referring to slanderers, as is evident from the continuation of the chapter, which states: “For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open tomb, they make smooth their tongue” (Psalms 5:10). |
| Psalms 5:12 | let them also who love Your name exult in You” | Sotah 31a:12 | It happened that there were <b>these two students who were sitting before Rava, </b> and <b>one said to him: It was read to me in my dream: “How abundant is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You”</b> (Psalms 31:20). <b>And one said to</b> Rava: <b>It was read to me in my dream: “So shall all those who take refuge in You rejoice; they will forever shout for joy, </b> and You will shelter them; <b>let them also who love Your name exult in You”</b> (Psalms 5:12). Rava <b>said to them: You are both completely righteous rabbis. </b> One <b>Sage, </b> the second dreamer, serves God <b>out of love, and</b> one <b>Sage, </b> the first dreamer, serves God <b>out of fear. </b> Each Sage’s dream corresponded to his manner of serving God. |
| Psalms 6:7 | as it is stated: “I am weary with my groaning; every night I speak in my bed; I melt away my couch with tears” | Sanhedrin 107a:12 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Even during the time of his illness he fulfilled</b> the mitzva of <b>conjugal rights for eighteen</b> wives, <b>as it is stated: “I am weary with my groaning; every night I speak in my bed; I melt away my couch with tears”</b> (Psalms 6:7). Even when he was weary and groaning he still spoke in his bed, a euphemism for sex. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: David sought to engage in idol worship</b> during Absalom’s coup, <b>as it is stated: “And it came to pass when David was at the top [<i>rosh</i>] of the ascent, where he would bow to God”</b> (II Samuel 15:32), <b>and <i>rosh</i></b> means <b>nothing other than idol worship, as it is stated: “As for that image, its head [<i>reishei</i>] was of fine gold”</b> (Daniel 2:32). |
| Psalms 7:1 | as it is written: “Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite” | Moed Katan16b:18 | The response to this admonishment <b>is</b> found in the verse, <b>as it is written: “Shiggaion of David, which he sang to YHWH, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite”</b> (Psalms 7:1). <b>Is Cush his name? Saul is his name. Rather, </b> this is a designation that indicates: <b>Just as a Cushite, </b> a native of the ancient kingdom of Cush in eastern Africa, <b>is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Saul was distinguished by his actions, </b> as he was absolutely righteous and performed many good deeds. Therefore, David uses the word <i>shiggaion</i> as an allusion to the error [<i>shegia</i>] that he had made when he sang a song of praise over Saul’s downfall. |
| Psalms 7:12 | It is written: “A God that has indignation every day” | Avodah Zarah4a:18 | <b>Rav Pappa raises a contradiction</b> between the following verses. <b>It is written: “A God that has indignation every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12), and yet the world still exists, <b>and it is written: “Who can stand before His indignation? ”</b> (Nahum 1:6). The Talmud answers: This is <b>not difficult; here, </b> where the verse states that no one can stand before His indignation, it is referring <b>to an individual, </b> whereas <b>there, </b> when it is written that God is indignant every day, it is referring <b>to the community, </b> which can withstand the indignation of God, due to its cumulative merits. |
| Psalms 7:12 | God is furious every day” | Berakhot 7a:7 | The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, God becomes angry, as it is stated: “God vindicates the righteous, <b>God is furious every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12). |
| Psalms 7:12 | God is angry every day” | Sanhedrin 105b:7 | <b>That is what Balaam said to Balak: “How can I curse, whom God has not cursed? </b> And how can I condemn, whom God has not condemned? ” (Numbers 23:8). Since God did not become angry, Balaam was unable to curse the Jewish people. It is written: “And <b>God is angry every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12). <b>And how long is</b> the duration of <b>His wrath? </b> It is <b>one moment, as it is stated: “For His anger endures but a moment; His favor is for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). |
| Psalms 8:2 | “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth that Your majesty is placed above the heavens” | Shabbat 88b:7 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses ascended on High</b> to receive the Torah, <b>the ministering angels said before God: God!, what is one born of a woman</b> doing here <b>among us? </b> God, <b>said to them: He came to receive the Torah. </b> The angels <b>said before Him: </b> The Torah is a <b>hidden treasure that was concealed by You 974 generations before the creation of the world, </b> and <b>You seek to give it to flesh and blood? </b> As it is stated: “The word which He commanded to a thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8). Since the Torah, the word of God, was given to the twenty-6th generation after Adam, the first man, the remaining 974 generations must have preceded the creation of the world. <b>“What is man that You are mindful of him and the son of man that You think of him? ”</b> (Psalms 8:5). Rather, <b>“God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth that Your majesty is placed above the heavens”</b> (Psalms 8:2). The rightful place of God’s majesty, the Torah, is in the heavens. |
| Psalms 8:3 | As it is stated: “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength” | Sotah 30b:16 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili taught: At the time that the Jewish people ascended from the sea they resolved to sing</b> a song of gratitude to God. <b>And how did they recite</b> this song? If <b>a baby</b> was <b>lying on his mother’s lap or an infant</b> was <b>nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Shekhina, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>As it is stated: “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength”</b> (Psalms 8:3). |
| Psalms 8:4 | His fingers, as it is written: “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars, which You have established” | Ketubot 5a:12 | <b>A certain Babylonian, and his name is R' Ḥiyya, responded</b> with a challenge. It is written with regard to creation of the earth: <b>“And His hands formed the dry land”</b> (Psalms 95:5). The Talmud answers: <b>“His hand”</b> is the way it <b>is written. </b> Although the word is vocalized in the plural, it is written in the singular, without the letter <i>yod</i>. <b>But isn’t it written: “Formed, ”</b> in the plural? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The plural is referring to <b>His fingers, as it is written: “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars, which You have established”</b> (Psalms 8:4). |
| Psalms 8:5 | said before him: Master of the Universe: “What is man that You are mindful of him? And the son of man that You think of him?” | Sanhedrin 38b:5 | The angels <b>said before him: God!: “What is man that You are mindful of him? And the son of man that You think of him? ”</b> (Psalms 8:5), i.e., a creature such as this is not worth creating. God <b>outstretched His small finger among them and burned them</b> with fire. <b>And the same</b> occurred with <b>a second group</b> of angels. The <b>3rd group</b> of angels that He asked <b>said before Him: God!, the first</b> two groups <b>who spoke</b> their mind <b>before You, what did they accomplish? The entire world is Yours; whatever You wish to do in Your world, do. </b> God then created the first person. |
| Psalms 8:5 | “What is man that You are mindful of him and the son of man that You think of him?” | Shabbat 88b:7 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses ascended on High</b> to receive the Torah, <b>the ministering angels said before God: God!, what is one born of a woman</b> doing here <b>among us? </b> God, <b>said to them: He came to receive the Torah. </b> The angels <b>said before Him: </b> The Torah is a <b>hidden treasure that was concealed by You 974 generations before the creation of the world, </b> and <b>You seek to give it to flesh and blood? </b> As it is stated: “The word which He commanded to a thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8).

Rather, <b>“God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth that Your majesty is placed above the heavens”</b> (Psalms 8:2). The rightful place of God’s majesty, the Torah, is in the heavens. |
| Psalms 8:6 | Rav and Shmuel, who both say: Fifty measures of understanding were created in the world, and all were given to Moses except one, as it is stated: “Yet you have deprived him of little, of God” | Nedarim 38a:9 | Moses was <b>wealthy, </b> as it is written: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), from which it was derived: The <b>waste</b> of the Tablets of the Covenant <b>shall be yours, </b> and that waste consisted of precious stones. That Moses <b>was wise</b> is derived from the statement of <b>Rav and Shmuel, who both say: Fifty measures of understanding were created in the world, and all were given to Moses except one, as it is stated: “Yet you have deprived him of little, of God”</b> (Psalms 8:6). He lacked only complete knowledge of God. Moses was <b>humble, as it is written: “Now the man Moses was very humble”</b> (Numbers 12:3). |
| Psalms 8:6 | it is stated: “And You have made him a little less than God” | Rosh Hashanah21b:11 | The aforementioned verse states: “The words of YHWH are pure words…purified seven times [<i>shivatayim</i>]. ” <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed about a matter relating to this verse: <b>One</b> of them <b>said: Fifty gates of understanding were created in the world, and all of them were given to Moses, except for one</b> gate, for it is stated: “The words of YHWH are purified <i>shivatayim</i>,” which he understands to mean seven times seven, i.e., forty-nine, and <b>it is stated: “And You have made him a little less than God”</b> (Psalms 8:6). God created fifty gates of understanding, but He made man a little lower than God, giving him only forty-nine of them. |
| Psalms 8:10 | as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth” | Shabbat 89a:1 | <b>idols</b> that you require this special warning? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? </b> God said to him: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you perform labor that you require rest</b> from it? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? “Do not take</b> the name of YHWH your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely. Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? </b> God said to him: <b>“Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you have a father or a mother</b> that would render the commandment to honor them relevant to you? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? </b> God said to him: <b>“You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13) Moses asked the angels: <b>Is there jealousy among you, </b> or <b>is there an evil inclination within you</b> that would render these commandments relevant? <b>Immediately they agreed with God, </b> that He made the right decision to give the Torah to the people, and <b>as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth”</b> (Psalms 8:10), <b>while “that Your majesty is placed above the heavens” is not written</b> because the angels agreed with God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on earth. |
| Psalms 9:7 | “The enemy are come to an end; the wasted places are forever” | Horayot 14a:2 | His son <b>said to him, </b> citing the verse: <b>“Their love as well as their hatred and their envy is long ago perished”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:6): That was long ago and they have already died. Therefore, there is no harm in mentioning their names. R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: </b> But it is also stated: <b>“The enemy are come to an end; the wasted places are forever”</b> (Psalms 9:7). Although the enemies died, the desolation that they created remains. Therefore, although they are dead, their names should not be mentioned. Rabban Shimon <b>said to</b> his father: <b>These matters</b> apply in a case <b>where their actions were effective. </b> In the case of these <b>rabbis, their actions were not effective. </b> R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>then taught him: </b> The rabbis <b>said in the name of R' Meir: If it was</b> considered <b>a substitute, it would not be sacrificed. Rava said: Even R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who is humble, taught: </b> The rabbis <b>said in the name of R' Meir. </b> But <b>he did not say</b> directly: <b>R' Meir said. </b> |
| Psalms 9:18 | “The wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld, all the nations that forget God” | Sanhedrin 105a:11 | <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> It is written: <b>“The wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld, all the nations that forget God”</b> (Psalms 9:18). <b>“The wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld”; these are the sinners of the Jewish people, </b> as only the sinners are sentenced to the netherworld. <b>“All the non-Jews that forget God”; these are the sinners of the non-Jews. </b> From the fact that it is written: “All the non-Jews,” it is apparent that none of the non-Jews have a share in the World-to-Come. This is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer. R' Yehoshua said to him: But is it stated</b> in the verse that the sinners of the Jewish people will be <b>like all of the non-Jews? It is stated only: “All the non-Jews that forget God. ” Rather, the wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld, </b> and <b>who are they? </b> They are <b>all the non-Jews that forget God. </b> non-Jews who fear God do have a share in the World-to-Come. |
| Psalms 9:21 | as it is stated: “Place for them mastery, O Lord” | Sotah 49a:2 | § <b>R' Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says: If it were not for the prayer of David</b> for Israel to have sustenance, <b>all Israel would be sellers of fat [<i>revav</i>], </b> i.e., involved in debased occupations, <b>as it is stated: “Place for them mastery, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 9:21), that is, may God grant them dignity. <b>And R' Ile’a bar Yeverekhya</b> also <b>says: If it were not for the prayer of Habakkuk, two Torah scholars would have to cover themselves with a single cloak</b> due to poverty <b>and engage in Torah study</b> dressed that way, <b>as it is stated: “Lord, I heard Your report and was afraid; O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2). <b>Do not read: “In the midst [<i>bekerev</i>] of the years [<i>shanim</i>], ” but in the closeness [<i>bikrov</i>] of two [<i>shenayim</i>]. </b> In other words, Habakkuk prayed that God would nullify His decree of two Torah scholars having to share a single cloak. |
| Psalms 10:3 | blaspheming. And with regard to this it is stated: “The robber who recites a blessing blasphemes the Lord” | Bava Kamma94a:5 | The Talmud answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> In the case of one <b>who robbed</b> another of <b>a <i>se’a</i> of wheat, </b> then <b>ground it, kneaded it, and baked it, and</b> he then <b>separated <i>ḥalla</i> from it, </b> i.e., he separated the portion of the dough that one is required to separate and then give to a priest, <b>how</b> can he <b>recite the blessing</b> over the separation of <i>ḥalla</i>? <b>This</b> individual is <b>not reciting a blessing, </b> but <b>rather</b> he is <b>blaspheming. And with regard to this it is stated: “The robber who recites a blessing blasphemes YHWH”</b> (Psalms 10:3), which is referring to a robber who recites a blessing upon performing a mitzva with an item he stole. According to R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, although this wheat has been significantly changed, it is still considered a stolen item. |
| Psalms 10:3 | the covetous [ botze’a ] blesses himself, though he despises the Lord” | Sanhedrin 6b:2 | The Talmud presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device alluding to the names of <i>tanna’im</i> in the coming discussion: <b><i>Samekh</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>; <i>beit</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>shin</i>. </b> The <i>Tosefta</i> cites several statements of <i>tanna’im</i> related to compromise and the term <i>botze’a</i>. <b>R' Eliezer ben Yosei HaGelili, says: </b> It is <b>prohibited to mediate</b> a dispute; <b>and anyone who mediates [<i>habotze’a</i>]</b> a dispute <b>is a sinner; and anyone who blesses the mediator is cursing</b> God. <b>And of this, it is stated: </b> “And <b>the covetous [<i>botze’a</i>] blesses himself, though he despises YHWH”</b> (Psalms 10:3). |
| Psalms 10:3 | And | Sanhedrin 7a:3 | § <b>And</b> the various rabbis who offered interpretations of the verse: “And the covetous blesses himself, though he despises YHWH” (Psalms 10:3), <b>disagree with</b> the explanation <b>of R' Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai. As R' Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: This verse was stated only with regard to the incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf, as it is stated: “And Aaron saw this, and he built [<i>vayyiven</i>] an altar [<i>mizbe’aḥ</i>] before it…</b>and said: Tomorrow shall be a feast to YHWH” (Exodus 32:5). <b>What</b> did Aaron <b>see? R' Binyamin bar Yefet says</b> that <b>R' Elazar says: He saw Hur, who</b> had been appointed together with Aaron by Moses to lead the people during Moses’ absence (see Exodus 24:14), <b>slaughtered before him, </b> as he had protested the plan to fashion a calf and had been murdered by the people as a result. The verse is therefore interpreted not as: Aaron built an altar before the calf, but rather: He understood [<i>vayyaven</i>] from the slaughter [<i>mizavuaḥ</i>] before his own eyes; and he then called for a feast. |
| Psalms 10:4 | even the Divine Presence is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God” | Nedarim 22b:2 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Anyone who gets angry, </b> at that moment <b>even the Shekhina is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God”</b> (Psalms 10:4). <b>R' Yirmeya of Difti said: </b> Anyone who gets angry <b>forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:9), <b>and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> With regard to one who gets angry, <b>it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in transgression”</b> (Proverbs 29:22). |
| Psalms 10:5 | As it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times; | Berakhot 7b:18 | From these verses in Psalms and Proverbs, it would seem that one is encouraged to provoke the wicked. The Talmud asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t R' Yitzḥak say: If you see a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling, do not provoke him. </b> As long as he is enjoying good fortune, there is no point in confronting him. <b>As it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times; </b> Your judgments are far beyond him; as for his adversaries, he snorts at them” (Psalms 10:5). The verse teaches us that the ways of the wicked will always succeed. <b>And not only that, but he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far beyond him, ”</b> meaning that even when he is brought to justice, it does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he witnesses his enemies’</b> downfall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them. ”</b> |
| Psalms 10:5 | his undertakings will be successful, as it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times” | Megillah 6b:5 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak</b> also <b>said: If you see a wicked man whom the hour is smiling upon, </b> i.e., who is enjoying good fortune, <b>do not provoke him, as it is stated: “Contend not with evildoers”</b> (Psalms 37:1). <b>And not only that, but</b> if you provoke him, <b>his undertakings will be successful, as it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times”</b> (Psalms 10:5). <b>And not only that, but</b> even if he is brought to court, <b>he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far above him”</b> (Psalms 10:5), as though the trial is far removed from him and does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he will see his enemies</b> fall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his enemies, he hisses at them”</b> (Psalms 10:5). |
| Psalms 10:8 | They said to him: Yes, Nakai shall be executed, as it is written: “In secret places he kills the innocent [ naki ]” | Sanhedrin 43a:23 | Then <b>they brought Nakai in</b> to stand trial. Nakai <b>said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Nakai be executed? </b> But <b>isn’t it written: “And the innocent [<i>naki</i>] and righteous you shall not slay”</b> (Exodus 23:7)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Nakai shall be executed, as it is written: “In secret places he kills the innocent [<i>naki</i>]”</b> (Psalms 10:8). |
| Psalms 10:9 | from this verse: “He lies in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, | Bava Metzia83b:5 | The Talmud relates a story that involves rising early. <b>R' Elazar ben Shimon, found a certain officer [<i>parhagavna</i>] whose</b> responsibility was to <b>arrest thieves. He said to</b> the officer: <b>How are you able</b> to arrest <b>them? Aren’t they likened to beasts, as it is written: </b> “You make darkness and it is night, <b>in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth”</b> (Psalms 104:20)? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say that he said to him</b> a proof <b>from this verse: “He lies in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, </b> he lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him up in his net” (Psalms 10:9). Since the wicked are so devious, <b>perhaps you apprehend the righteous and leave the wicked</b> alone? |
| Psalms 10:15 | as it is written: “Break the arm of the wicked” | Megillah 17b:15 | <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says the blessing of</b> bountiful <b>years as the 9th</b> blessing? <b>R' Alexandri said: </b> This blessing was instituted <b>in reference to those who raise the prices</b> of food. We pray for rain so that the price of produce will not rise as a result of shortages, <b>as it is written: “Break the arm of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 10:15), referring to the wicked, who practice deception and extort the poor. <b>And when David expressed this</b> request, <b>he expressed it in the 9th</b> psalm. Although today it is considered the 10th psalm, the first and second psalms are actually counted as one, and therefore this is the 9th psalm. Therefore, the blessing of the years was fixed as the 9th blessing. |
| Psalms 10:16 | and, for example: “The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land” | Rosh Hashanah32b:3 | The Talmud qualifies the Mishnah’s ruling. <b>However, if one comes to recite</b> verses of <b>Kingship, remembrance, and <i>shofar</i></b> with a theme <b>of the punishment of non-Jews, one may recite</b> them. The Talmud offers examples of these verses: With regard to the verses of <b>Kingship, for example: “YHWH reigns, let the peoples tremble”</b> (Psalms 99:1), <b>and, for example: “YHWH is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land”</b> (Psalms 10:16). With regard to <b>remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom</b> the day of Jerusalem, who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). With regard to the verses of <b><i>shofar</i>, for example: “And YHWH God will sound the</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>and will go with whirlwinds of the south”</b> (Zechariah 9:14), <b>and it is written: “YHWH of hosts will defend them”</b> (Zechariah 9:15), i.e., God will defend the Jewish people against their enemies. |
| Psalms 10:17 | direct their hearts, Your ear will listen” | Berakhot 31a:17 | Returning to the topic of preparation for prayer, <b>A baraita states</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who prays must focus his heart toward Heaven. Abba Shaul says: An indication of</b> the importance of this <b>matter</b> is stated in the verse: “The desire of the humble You have heard, Lord; <b>direct their hearts, Your ear will listen”</b> (Psalms 10:17). In other words, if one focuses his heart in prayer as a result of God directing his heart, his prayer will be accepted as God’s ear will listen. |
| Psalms 11:1 | which is written: “To the leader, of David. In the Lord I put my trust; how can you say to my soul: Flee like a bird to your mountain” | Sanhedrin 107a:7 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “To the leader, of David. In YHWH I put my trust; how can you say to my soul: Flee like a bird to your mountain”</b> (Psalms 11:1)? <b>David said before God: God!, pardon me for that sin</b> with Bathsheba so <b>that</b> the wicked people <b>will not say: The mountain that is among you, </b> i.e., the luminary of the generation, David, <b>was driven</b> from the world due to <b>a bird</b> that led to his transgression. |
| Psalms 11:2 | “For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string” | Sanhedrin 26a:22 | <b>When Sennacherib came and besieged Jerusalem, Shebna wrote a note and shot</b> it over the wall <b>with an arrow. </b> It read: <b>Shebna and his camp have appeased</b> Sennacherib and are ready to surrender; <b>Hezekiah and his camp have not appeased</b> Sennacherib. <b>As it is stated</b> in allusion to this incident: <b>“For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string”</b> (Psalms 11:2). |
| Psalms 11:3 | states: “When the foundations are destroyed, what has the Righteous One done?” | Sanhedrin 26b:3 | <b>And</b> following the aforementioned verse: “For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string,” the next verse <b>states: “When the foundations are destroyed, what has the Righteous One done? ”</b> (Psalms 11:3). <b>Rav Yehuda and Rav Eina</b> interpret this verse. <b>One says: If Hezekiah and his camp are destroyed, what has the Righteous One done? And one says: If the Temple should be destroyed, what has the Righteous One done? And Ulla says: If the intentions of that wicked person, </b> Sennacherib, <b>are not destroyed, what has the Righteous One done? </b> |
| Psalms 12:1 | as it is stated: “For the Leader, on the eighth: | Arakhin 13b:11 | R' Yehuda continues: <b>And</b> the harp that will be played <b>in the days of the Messiah</b> will have <b>eight</b> strings, <b>as it is stated: “For the Leader, on the 8th: </b> A Psalm of David” (Psalms 12:1). This indicates that the psalms that will be recited in the time of the Messiah, son of David, will be played <b>on the 8th string</b> that will be added to the harp. |
| Psalms 12:1 | “For the leader, on the Sheminith : A Psalm of David” | Menachot 43b:11 | <b>And when David entered the bathhouse and saw himself standing naked, he said: Woe to me that that I stand naked without</b> any <b>mitzva. But once he remembered the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision that was in his flesh his mind was put at ease, </b> as he realized he was still accompanied by this mitzva. <b>After he left</b> the bathhouse, <b>he recited a song about</b> the mitzva of circumcision, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“For the leader, on the <i>Sheminith</i>: A Psalm of David”</b> (Psalms 12:1). This is interpreted as a psalm <b>about circumcision, which was given</b> to be performed <b>on the 8th [<i>bashemini</i>]</b> day of the baby’s life. |
| Psalms 12:2 | the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Help, Lord, for the pious man is finished; | Sotah 48a:13 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when the early prophets died the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> was nullified. From</b> the time <b>when the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed the <i>shamir</i></b> worm <b>ceased</b> to exist <b>and</b> also <b>the sweetness of the honeycomb, </b> as the verse says with regard to the laws of the Torah: “More to be desired are they than gold, indeed, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb” (Psalms 19:11). <b>And men of faith ceased from</b> being among <b>the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Help, Lord, for the pious man is finished; </b> for the faithful fail from among the children of men” (Psalms 12:2). |
| Psalms 12:4 | karet , as it is stated: “May the Lord cut off [ yakhret ] all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things” | Arakhin 15b:17 | <b>R' Aḥa ben Ḥanina says: </b> If one has already <b>spoken</b> malicious speech, <b>he has no remedy, as</b> King <b>David, </b> inspired <b>by Holy Spirit, has already</b> cut him off with the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “May YHWH cut off [<i>yakhret</i>] all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>Rather, what is his remedy</b> beforehand, <b>so that he does not come to</b> speak <b>malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar, </b> let him <b>study Torah; and if he is an am ha'aretz</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated: </b> “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, <b>but its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). One who is humble will not come to speak badly about another. |
| Psalms 12:4 | the tongue that speaks great things” | Arakhin 15b:18 | <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught: Anyone who speaks malicious speech increases</b> his <b>sins</b> to the degree that they <b>correspond</b> to the <b>three</b> cardinal <b>transgressions: Idol worship, and forbidden sexual sex, and bloodshed. </b> This can be derived from a verbal analogy based on the word “great. ” <b>It is written here: </b> “May YHWH cut off all flattering lips, <b>the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>And it is written with regard to idol worship: </b> “And Moses returned to YHWH, and said: <b>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, </b> and have made for themselves a god of gold” (Exodus 32:31). |
| Psalms 12:5 | As it is stated: “Who have said: We will make our tongue mighty; our lips are with us: Who is lord over us” | Arakhin 15b:6 | Furthermore, <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Yosei ben Zimra: Anyone who speaks malicious speech</b> is considered <b>as though he denied the fundamental</b> belief in God. <b>As it is stated: “Who have said: We will make our tongue mighty; our lips are with us: Who is lord over us”</b> (Psalms 12:5). |
| Psalms 12:6 | absolute truth causes the Divine Presence to withdraw from Israel, as it is stated: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the Lord” | Sanhedrin 7a:17 | § The Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device indicating the following series of statements about judges and their functions: <b><i>Emet mamon yireh</i>. R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says: Any judge who judges a judgment</b> according to <b>absolute truth</b> [<i>emet</i>] <b>causes the Shekhina to rest among Israel, as it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judges”</b> (Psalms 82:1), indicating that the Shekhina is in the midst of the court. <b>And every judge who does not judge a judgment</b> according to <b>absolute truth causes the Shekhina to withdraw from Israel, as it is stated: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says YHWH”</b> (Psalms 12:6). God will arise and leave the people as a result of oppression. |
| Psalms 12:7 | revealed? Rabbi Abbahu said: The verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words; silver refined in the clear sight [ ba’alil ] of the earth, purified seven times” | Rosh Hashanah21b:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that the term <b><i>alil</i></b> denotes that the new moon is clearly <b>revealed? R' Abbahu said: The verse states: “The words of YHWH are pure words; silver refined in the clear sight [<i>ba’alil</i>] of the earth, purified seven times”</b> (Psalms 12:7). |
| Psalms 12:9 | As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about, | Berakhot 6b:18 | Back to the topic of deference for a synagogue, the Talmud records that <b>Rav Huna said: One who prays behind the synagogue is called wicked, </b> as while the entire congregation is facing one direction to pray, he faces the opposite direction creating the impression that he is treating the synagogue and its congregation with contempt. <b>As it is stated: “The wicked walk round about, </b> when vileness is exalted among the sons of men” (Psalms 12:9). In other words, only the wicked walk round about the synagogue in order to pray. |
| Psalms 14:1 | as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’; | Berakhot 12b:22 | In response, the Talmud cites a <i>baraita</i> where these elements were derived from allusions in the verse, “You shall stray neither after your hearts nor after your eyes, after which you would lust” (Numbers 15:39). <b>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to</b> following opinions <b>of heresy</b> that may arise in one’s heart. The Talmud offers a proof, <b>as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’; </b> they have been corrupt, they have acted abominably; there is none who does good” (Psalms 14:1). The phrase: <b>“After your eyes, ”</b> in <b>this</b> verse refers to following <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, that a person might see and desire, <b>as it is stated: “And Samson said to his father, ‘That one take for me, for she is upright in my eyes’”</b> (Judges 14:3). The passage: <b>“You shall stray after”</b> refers to promiscuity, which in the parlance of the prophets is a metaphor for <b>idol worship, as it is stated: </b> “The children of Israel again <b>went astray after the Be’alim”</b> (Judges 8:33). |
| Psalms 14:1 | states: “The vile man has said in his heart: There is no God, | Yevamot 63b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:32), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is</b> a reference to the children’s <b>father’s wife, </b> their stepmother. With regard to the verse: <b>“I will provoke them with a vile nation”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:21), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is a bad wife whose marriage contract is large. R' Eliezer says</b> that <b>these are apostates, and so too</b> the verse <b>states: “The vile man has said in his heart: There is no God, </b> they have dealt corruptly” (Psalms 14:1), which proves that an apostate is called vile. |
| Psalms 14:4 | “The eaters of My people ate bread, and they call not upon the Lord” | Sanhedrin 104b:12 | With regard to the verse: <b>“The eaters of My people ate bread, and they call not upon YHWH”</b> (Psalms 14:4), <b>Rava says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: Any</b> non-Jew thief <b>who eats the bread of the Jewish people tastes the flavor of bread, and one who does not eat from the bread of the Jewish people does not taste the flavor of bread. </b> Apparently they enjoy only what they steal from the Jewish people. With regard to the people referred to in the phrase <b>“And they call not upon YHWH, ” Rav says: These are the judges</b> who are not God-fearing, <b>and Shmuel says: These are schoolteachers</b> who do not perform their job in the name of God. |
| Psalms 15:2 | “And speaks truth in his heart” | Bava Batra88a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>because one determined to buy</b> the produce, even though he says nothing and performs no act of acquisition, <b>he acquires</b> the produce <b>and becomes obligated in tithes? Rav Hoshaya said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a buyer who is <b>God-fearing, such as Rav Safra, </b> who <b>himself fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“And speaks truth in his heart”</b> (Psalms 15:2). With regard to business matters Rav Safra considered himself bound by his thoughts at the time of negotiations, even if he did not express them verbally or perform any action (see <i>Makkot</i> 24a). A person on the ethical level of Rav Safra acquires the produce and becomes obligated to separate tithes from the moment that he decides to buy it. |
| Psalms 15:4 | But isn’t it written: “But he honors those that fear the Lord” | Ketubot 103b:23 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so</b> that it is correct to behave in such a manner? <b>But isn’t it written: “But he honors those that fear YHWH”</b> (Psalms 15:4), <b>and the Master said: This</b> is referring to <b>Jehoshaphat, king of Judea. When he would see a Torah scholar he would rise from his throne and hug him and kiss him and call to him: My teacher, my teacher, my master, my master. </b> This demonstrates that it is appropriate even for a king to behave with affection toward Torah scholars. |
| Psalms 15:4 | “In his eyes a vile person is despised, | Sanhedrin 47a:1 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught with regard to the verse: <b>“In his eyes a vile person is despised, </b> but he honors them that fear YHWH” (Psalms 15:4). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>Hezekiah, king of Judea, who dragged the bones of his father, </b> Ahaz, <b>on a bier</b> made <b>of ropes, </b> and he did not bury Ahaz in a manner befitting a king in order to disgrace him for his sinful conduct. <b>And if</b> the eulogy and other funeral rites are meant <b>to honor the living, what is the reason</b> that he acted this way, in a manner that brought disgrace upon himself and all of the Jewish people? |
| Psalms 15:5 | anyone who has money and lends it without interest, the verse says about him: “He who has not given his money with interest and who has not taken a bribe against the innocent, he who does these shall never collapse” | Bava Metzia71a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar says: </b> Concerning <b>anyone who has money and lends it without interest, the verse says about him: “He who has not given his money with interest and who has not taken a bribe against the innocent, he who does these shall never collapse”</b> (Psalms 15:5). From this statement, the opposite can also be inferred: <b>You learn</b> from this <b>that</b> concerning <b>anyone who lends</b> his money to others <b>with interest, his property, </b> i.e., his financial standing, <b>collapses. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But we see</b> people <b>who do not lend</b> money <b>with interest and</b> nevertheless their property <b>collapses. R' Elazar says: </b> There is still a difference: <b>Those</b> who do not lend money with interest <b>collapse but</b> then ultimately <b>rise, but these, </b> who lend with interest, <b>collapse and do not rise</b> again. |
| Psalms 16:2 | “I have said to the Lord: You are my Lord; I have no good but in You [ tovati bal alekha ]” | Menachot 53a:15 | When R' Ezra entered his house, R' Perida <b>saw that</b> R' Ezra’s <b>mind was troubled</b> with embarrassment at having to wait outside. Therefore, R' Perida taught a homily to comfort R' Ezra. <b>He began and said</b> an interpretation of the verse: <b>“I have said to YHWH: You are my Lord; I have no good but in You [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:2). R' Perida interpreted: <b>The congregation of Israel said before God: God!, give me credit, as I made Your</b> Name <b>known in the world, </b> as indicated by the phrase: “You are my Lord. ” |
| Psalms 16:3 | known in the world, as it is stated: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent [ ve’addirei ] in whom is all My delight” | Menachot 53a:16 | God <b>said to</b> the congregation of Israel: <b>I give no credit to you [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>]. </b> God explained: <b>I give credit only to</b> the three Patriarchs, <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who</b> were the <b>first who made My</b> Name <b>known in the world, as it is stated: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). The holy in the earth are the Patriarchs, in whom God delights. In this manner R' Perida alluded to the importance of the ancestors of the Jewish people, including Ezra the Scribe, from whom R' Ezra was descended. |
| Psalms 16:3 | are the Jews, as it is stated: “The excellent [ ve’addirei ] in whom is all My delight” | Menachot 53a:18 | R' Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>Addir</i> in the phrase: <b>Let the <i>Addir</i> come, this is God as it is written: “YHWH on high is mighty [<i>addir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). In the phrase: <b>And exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Jews, as it is stated: “The excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). In the phrase: <b>From the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Egyptians, as it is written</b> with regard to the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“The mighty [<i>addirim</i>] sank as lead in the waters”</b> (Exodus 15:10). In the phrase: <b>In the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the waters, as it is stated: “Above the voices of many waters, the mighty [<i>addirim</i>] breakers of the sea”</b> (Psalms 93:4). |
| Psalms 16:4 | as it is written: “I will not pour their libations of blood” | Sanhedrin 60b:6 | The Talmud suggests: <b>And let</b> the Mishnah <b>also count sprinkling</b> the blood of an offering, which is also one of the sacrificial rites in the Temple. <b>Abaye says: Sprinkling</b> the blood of an offering <b>is</b> the same as <b>pouring</b> a libation, since they are essentially one sacrificial rite, <b>as it is written: “I will not pour their libations of blood”</b> (Psalms 16:4), indicating that sprinkling the blood of an offering is also referred to as offering a libation. |
| Psalms 16:8 | on his arm, as it is stated: “I have set the Lord always before me; He is at my right hand, that I shall not be moved” | Sanhedrin 21b:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the one that goes out and comes in with him, he makes it</b> very small, <b>like an amulet, and he hangs</b> it <b>on his arm, as it is stated: “I have set YHWH always before me; He is at my right hand, that I shall not be moved”</b> (Psalms 16:8). This alludes to the small Torah scroll that is always on his right hand. <b>He does not go into the bathhouse with it, nor into the bathroom, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read from it”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19), meaning, it shall remain in <b>a place that is appropriate for reading from it. </b> |
| Psalms 16:8 | “I have set the Lord always before me; | Sanhedrin 22a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if the script was in fact not changed, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“a second [<i>mishne</i>] Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:18)? This serves <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>two Torah scrolls</b> that the king writes, <b>one that goes out and comes in with him, and one that is placed in his treasury. </b> With regard to <b>the one that goes out and comes in with him, he makes it</b> very small, <b>like an amulet, and he hangs</b> it <b>on his arm. As it is stated</b> by King David: <b>“I have set YHWH always before me; </b> He is at my right hand, that I shall not be moved” (Psalms 16:8). This verse alludes to the two Torah scrolls, one that is before him and one that is in his right hand. |
| Psalms 16:8 | “I have set” | Sanhedrin 22a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, i.e., R' Yehuda HaNasi, who does not hold that the king must write and affix the second scroll to his arm, <b>what does he expound from that</b> verse: <b>“I have set”</b> (Psalms 16:8)? The Talmud responds: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥana bar Bizna, as Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>R' Shimon Ḥasida says: One who prays needs to see himself as if the Shekhina is opposite him, as it is stated: “I have set YHWH always before me”</b> (Psalms 16:8). |
| Psalms 16:9 | as it is written: “My flesh also dwells secure” | Bava Batra17a:5 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There were <b>seven</b> people <b>over whom the worm and the maggot had no sway, and they are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written with regard to them, </b> respectively: <b>“With everything, ” “from everything, ” “everything. ” Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is written with regard to them: “By the mouth of YHWH”; Benjamin, son of Jacob, as it is written: “And to Benjamin he said: The beloved of YHWH, he shall dwell in safety by Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:12). Even in death, he rests securely, unbothered by worms. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even David</b> is included, <b>as it is written: “My flesh also dwells secure”</b> (Psalms 16:9). The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> authority, who does not include David, explain this? The Talmud answers: <b>He is asking for mercy, </b> that his flesh should dwell secure and not be subject to worms and maggots, but his request was denied. |
| Psalms 16:10 | Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [ shaḥat ]” | Eruvin 19a:17 | <b>She’ol, as it is written: “Out of the belly of the netherworld [<i>she’ol</i>] I cried and You did hear my voice”</b> (Jonah 2:3). <b>Avadon, as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [<i>avadon</i>]? ”</b> (Psalms 88:12). <b>Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [<i>shaḥat</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:10). <b>And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven, as it is written: “He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit [<i>bor shaon</i>], out of the miry clay [<i>tit hayaven</i>]”</b> (Psalms 40:3). <b>And Tzalmavet, as it is written: “Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death [<i>tzalmavet</i>], </b> bound in affliction and iron” (Psalms 107:10). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Taḥtit, </b> i.e., the underworld, <b>it is</b> known by <b>tradition</b> that this is its name. |
| Psalms 16:10 | so that he will not be in Gehenna while his students are in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For You will not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither will You suffer Your godly one to see the pit” | Yoma 87a:6 | Furthermore: <b>Whoever</b> accumulates <b>merit for the public will not have sin come to his hand, </b> and God protects him from failing; <b>but whoever causes the public to sin has almost no ability to repent. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>whoever</b> accumulates <b>merit for the public will not have sin come to his hand? </b> It is <b>so that he will not be in Gehenna while his students are in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For You will not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither will You suffer Your godly one to see the pit”</b> (Psalms 16:10). On the other hand, <b>whoever causes the public to sin has almost no ability to repent, </b> so that <b>he will not be in the Garden of Eden while his students are in Gehenna, as it is stated: “A man who is laden with the blood of any person shall hasten his steps to the pit; none will support him”</b> (Proverbs 28:17). Since he oppressed others and caused them to sin, he shall have no escape. |
| Psalms 16:11 | of seven strings, as it is stated: “In your presence is fullness [ sova ] of joy, | Arakhin 13b:10 | The Mishnah teaches: The minors <b>would not engage in</b> playing <b>a lyre and in</b> playing <b>a harp; rather, in</b> singing with <b>the mouth</b> in order to provide flavor to the music with their pure, high voices. The Talmud notes: <b>That is to say that a lyre and a harp are</b> two <b>distinct</b> instruments. <b>Let us say that the Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: The harp</b> used <b>in the Temple was</b> an instrument <b>of seven strings, as it is stated: “In your presence is fullness [<i>sova</i>] of joy, </b> in your right hand sweetness for evermore” (Psalms 16:11). <b>Do not read</b> the word as “<b>fullness [<i>sova</i>]” but</b> as <b>seven [<i>sheva</i>]. </b> This indicates that the “sweet harp” (see Psalms 81:3) played in the presence of God, i.e., in the Temple, has seven strings. |
| Psalms 17:3 | which is written: “You have proved my heart; You have visited me in the night: You have tried me, but You find nothing; let no presumptuous thought pass my lips” | Sanhedrin 107a:6 | <b>Immediately, </b> it is written: <b>“And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said: Is not this Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was purified from her impurity, and then she returned to her house”</b> (II Samuel 11:3–4). <b>And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You have proved my heart; You have visited me in the night: You have tried me, but You find nothing; let no presumptuous thought pass my lips”</b> (Psalms 17:3). David <b>said: Oh, that a muzzle would have fallen upon the mouth of the one who hates me, </b> a euphemism for his own mouth, <b>and I would not have said anything like that</b> and I would have withstood the ordeal. |
| Psalms 17:14 | male children, as it is stated: “And whose belly You fill with Your treasure [ utzfunekha ], who have sons in plenty | Berakhot 5b:23 | In praise of that stringency, the rabbis added that <b>R' Ḥama said</b> that <b>R' Ḥanina said</b> that <b>R' Yitzḥak said: One who places his bed facing north to south will</b> be rewarded with <b>male children, as it is stated: “And whose belly You fill with Your treasure [<i>utzfunekha</i>], who have sons in plenty</b> and leave their abundance to their babies” (Psalms 17:14). This verse indicates that one who sets his bed facing north will be rewarded with sons in plenty, as north [<i>tzafon</i>] is etymologically similar to Your treasure [<i>tzfunekha</i>]. |
| Psalms 17:14 | “From death, by Your hand, O Lord, from death | Berakhot 61b:10 | <b>The ministering angels said before God: This is Torah and this its reward? </b> As it is stated: <b>“From death, by Your hand, O Lord, from death</b> of the world” (Psalms 17:14); Your hand, God, kills and does not save. God <b>said</b> the end of the verse <b>to</b> the ministering angels: <b>“Whose portion is in this life. ”</b> And then <b>a bat kol emerged and said: Happy are you, R' Akiva, as you are destined for life in the World-to-Come, </b> as your portion is already in eternal life. |
| Psalms 17:15 | peruta to a poor person, he merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “As for me, I will behold Your face through charity; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness” | Bava Batra10a:13 | <b>R' Dostai ben Yannai, taught: Come and see that the attribute of God is not like the attribute of flesh and blood. </b> An illustration of <b>the attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person brings a great gift to the king, it is uncertain whether</b> the king <b>will accept it from him or will not accept it from him. And if you say that</b> the king <b>will accept it from him, it is uncertain whether</b> the person who brought the gift <b>will</b> eventually <b>see the face of the king, or will not see the face of the king. But God does not</b> act in <b>this way. </b> Even when <b>a person gives a</b> mere <b><i>peruta</i> to a poor person, he merits to receive the Shekhina, as it is stated: “As for me, I will behold Your face through charity; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness”</b> (Psalms 17:15). |

| Psalms 18:33 | “Who girds me [ hame’azreni ] with strength” | Niddah 31a:19 | This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of R' Abbahu, as R' Abbahu raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one of King David’s psalms: <b>“For You have girded me [<i>vatazreni</i>] with strength for battle”</b> (II Samuel 22:40), without the letter <i>alef</i> in <i>vatazreni</i>; <b>and it is written</b> in another psalm: <b>“Who girds me [<i>hame’azreni</i>] with strength”</b> (Psalms 18:33), with an <i>alef</i> in <i>hame’azreini</i>. What is the difference between these two expressions? <b>David said before God: God!, You selected me [<i>zeiritani</i>], </b> i.e., You separated between the procreative part and the rest of the semen in order to create me, <b>and You have girded me [<i>zeraztani</i>] with strength. </b> |

| Psalms 18:37 | which is written: “You have enlarged my steps beneath me, that my feet did not slip” | Sanhedrin 95a:8 | <b>One day</b> David <b>went to hunt</b> with <b>a falcon [<i>liskor bazzai</i>].

| Psalms 19:2 | The Gemara raises an objection: “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of His hands” | Ketubot 5a:13 | <b>The Talmud raises an objection: “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of His hands”</b> (Psalms 19:2). The heavens were created by His hands. The Talmud answers that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: Who attests to the handiwork of the righteous, </b> that they are performing the will of God? It is <b>the heavens.

| Psalms 19:8 | feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect [ temima ], restoring the soul” | Kiddushin 2b:8 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verses do not contradict each other. Here, </b> that verse: “The way in which they must walk” (Exodus 18:20), <b>is referring to the Torah, </b> i.e., the way mentioned here is referring to the path of the Torah, <b>and Torah is referred to</b> in the <b>feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of YHWH is perfect [<i>temima</i>], restoring the soul”</b> (Psalms 19:8). The word <i>temima</i> is in the feminine. Consequently, in reference to the Torah the verse <b>writes: </b> <i>Derekh</i>, <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There, that</b> verse: “Shall flee before you seven ways” (Deuteronomy 28:7), <b>is referring to war, </b> and <b>as it is the way of a man to wage war and it is not the way of a woman to wage war, </b> it is appropriate to speak in the masculine. Therefore, the verse <b>writes</b> the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine. </b> |
| Psalms 19:8 | “The testimony of God is faithful” | Yoma 72b:17 | In the same Psalm the verse states: <b>“The testimony of God is faithful”</b> (Psalms 19:8). <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: </b> This alludes to the fact that the Torah <b>is faithful to testify about those who study it</b> and those who do not. |
| Psalms 19:9 | words of Torah, as it is written: “The precepts of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart” | Arakhin 11a:11 | <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that the source for the requirement to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here: “Because you did not serve YHWH your God with joyfulness, and with goodness of heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:47). <b>What is</b> this <b>service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>with joyfulness and with goodness of heart?

| Psalms 19:9 | because it is stated: “The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart” | Taanit 30a:11 | <b>However, one may read from a place</b> in the Bible <b>that he is unaccustomed to reading, </b> as it will be difficult for him and he will not derive pleasure from it, <b>and he</b> may likewise <b>study from a place</b> of the Talmud <b>that he is unaccustomed to studying.

| Psalms 19:14 | “And I shall be clear from great transgression” | Sanhedrin 107a:16 | David requested: <b>“And I shall be clear from great transgression”</b> (Psalms 19:14), meaning <b>that my transgression</b> with Bathsheba and Uriah <b>will not be written</b> in the Bible.

| Psalms 20:2 | that which is written: “The Lord will answer you on the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you upon high” | Berakhot 64a:6 | <b>And R' Avin HaLevi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “YHWH will answer you on the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you upon high”</b> (Psalms 20:2)? Is God specifically <b>the God of Jacob and not the God of Abraham and Isaac? </b> Rather, <b>from here</b> the general principle is derived: <b>One who owns a beam should approach</b> carrying <b>the thick portion of the beam. </b> A builder, carrying a beam in order to affix it in a building, must calibrate it and measure carefully so that the thick part of the beam fits in its place; so too must Jacob, who fathered and raised the children who would become the people of Israel, continue to pray for them and complete the task of nation-building. |
| Psalms 21:3 | from here: “You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah” | Eruvin 54a:12 | <b>Rava said</b> that this idea is actually derived <b>from here: “You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah”</b> (Psalms 21:3). <b>When have You given him his heart’s desire? When You have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah, </b> i.e., when he converses in words of Torah. |
| Psalms 21:5 | as it is stated: “He asked life of You, You gave it to him; | Sukkah 52a:6 | <b>A baraita states: To Messiah ben David, who is destined to be revealed swiftly in our time, God says: Ask of Me anything and I will give you</b> whatever you wish, <b>as it is stated: “I will tell of the decree; </b> YHWH said unto me: You are My son, <b>this day have I begotten you, ask of Me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, </b> and the ends of the earth for your possession” (Psalms 2:7–8). <b>Once</b> the Messiah ben David <b>saw Messiah ben Yosef, who was killed, he says</b> to God: <b>God!, I ask of you only life; </b> that I will not suffer the same fate. God, <b>says to him: Life? </b> Even <b>before you stated</b> this request, <b>your father, David, already prophesied about you</b> with regard to this matter precisely, <b>as it is stated: “He asked life of You, You gave it to him; </b> even length of days for ever and ever” (Psalms 21:5). |
| Psalms 22:1 | as it is written: “For the leader, about the morning hind” | Yoma 29a:3 | Apropos moonlight and sunlight discussed previously, <b>R' Abbahu said: What is the rationale</b> for the statement of <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi that sunlight diffuses and in that sense is dissimilar to moonlight? It is <b>as it is written: “For the leader, about the morning hind”</b> (Psalms 22:1); <b>just as the antlers of a hind branch out to here and to there, so too, </b> the light of <b>dawn diffuses to here and to there. </b> |
| Psalms 22:2 | said: “My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?” | Megillah 15b:7 | § The Talmud returns to its explanation of the verses of the Megilla. The verse states with regard to Esther: <b>“And she stood in the inner court of the king’s house”</b> (Esther 5:1). <b>R' Levi said: Once she reached the chamber of the idols, </b> which was in the inner court, <b>the Shekhina left her. She</b> immediately <b>said: “My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? ”</b> (Psalms 22:2). <b>Perhaps</b> it is because <b>You judge an unintentional sin as one</b> performed <b>intentionally, and</b> an action <b>done due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond one’s control as</b> one done <b>willingly. </b> |
| Psalms 22:3 | during the day, as it is stated: “O my God, I call by day but You do not answer; and at night, and there is no surcease for me” | Megillah 4a:8 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>said</b> with regard to Purim: <b>A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>to repeat it</b> [<b><i>lishnota</i></b>] <b>during the day, as it is stated: “O my God, I call by day but You do not answer; and at night, and there is no surcease for me”</b> (Psalms 22:3), which alludes to reading the Megilla both by day and by night. |
| Psalms 22:7 | he said: “But I am a worm, and no man” | Chullin 89a:6 | <b>I granted greatness to Abraham, </b> yet <b>he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). I granted greatness <b>to Moses and Aaron, </b> yet Moses <b>said</b> of the two of them: <b>“And what are we”</b> (Exodus 16:7). I granted greatness <b>to David, </b> yet <b>he said: “But I am a worm, and no man”</b> (Psalms 22:7). |
| Psalms 22:21 | a dog, as it is stated: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the hand of the dog” | Megillah 15b:8 | <b>Or perhaps</b> You have left me <b>because</b> in my prayers <b>I called</b> Haman <b>a dog, as it is stated: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the hand of the dog”</b> (Psalms 22:21). <b>She</b> at once <b>retracted and called him</b> in her prayers <b>a lion, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Save me from the lion’s mouth”</b> (Psalms 22:22). |
| Psalms 22:22 | “Save me from the lion’s mouth” | Megillah 15b:8 | <b>Or perhaps</b> You have left me <b>because</b> in my prayers <b>I called</b> Haman <b>a dog, as it is stated: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the hand of the dog”</b> (Psalms 22:21). <b>She</b> at once <b>retracted and called him</b> in her prayers <b>a lion, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Save me from the lion’s mouth”</b> (Psalms 22:22). |
| Psalms 22:30 | death, as it is stated: “All those who go down to the dust shall kneel before Him” | Niddah 30b:24 | <b>And</b> a fetus <b>does not leave</b> the womb <b>until</b> the angels <b>administer an oath to it, as it is stated: “That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear”</b> (Isaiah 45:23). The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“That to Me every knee shall bow”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>death, as it is stated: “All those who go down to the dust shall kneel before Him”</b> (Psalms 22:30). <b>“Every tongue shall swear”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>birth, as it is stated</b> in description of a righteous person: <b>“He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not taken My name in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully”</b> (Psalms 24:4), i.e., he has kept the oath that he took before he was born. |
| Psalms 22:31 | is written: “Their seed shall serve Him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation” | Sanhedrin 110b:12 | <b>It was stated: </b> With regard to <b>a minor</b> who dies, <b>from when, </b> i.e., from what stage, <b>does he come into the World-to-Come? </b> There is a dispute between <b>R' Ḥiyya and R' Shimon bar R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>One</b> of them <b>says: From the moment that he is born, and</b> the other <b>one says: From the moment that</b> he begins to <b>talk. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>The one who says: From the moment that he is born, </b> derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “They shall come and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall be born, that He has done this”</b> (Psalms 22:32). <b>And the one who says: From the moment that</b> he begins to <b>talk, </b> derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “Their seed shall serve Him; it shall be told of YHWH to the coming generation”</b> (Psalms 22:31), as from the moment he talks, he belongs to God. |
| Psalms 22:31 | as it is written: “Their seed shall serve Him” | Sanhedrin 110b:13 | <b>It was stated</b> that additional <i>amora’im</i> expressed opinions about the same matter. <b>Ravina says: From the moment that</b> the child <b>is conceived, </b> even before his birth, he can enter the World-to-Come, <b>as it is written: “Their seed shall serve Him”</b> (Psalms 22:31); even as seed the child merits to enter the World-to-Come. <b>R' Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: From the moment that he is circumcised, as it is written: “I am poor and close to death from youth; I suffered your terrors [<i>emekha</i>], I am numb”</b> (Psalms 88:16). From the moment that one bears the mark that the Jewish people have due to fear of God [<i>eima</i>], he turns to God and he belongs to Him. |
| Psalms 22:31 | it says: “A seed shall serve him; it shall be told | Sotah 20b:14 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If she has merit, it delays</b> punishment <b>for her</b> for <b>three months, equivalent</b> to the time necessary <b>to recognize the fetus; </b> this is <b>the statement of Abba Yosei ben Ḥanan. R' Elazar ben Yitzḥak of Kefar Darom says: </b> Merit delays punishment for <b>nine months, as it is stated: “Then she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28). It is possible to infer from this that if she has merit she will be cleared temporarily, for the length of time required to conceive a child, <b>and there, </b> in Psalms, <b>it says: “A seed shall serve him; it shall be told</b> of YHWH unto the next generation” (Psalms 22:31). This indicates that the <b>seed</b> must <b>be fit to tell</b> of YHWH once it matures, and a child can live only if it is born after the culmination of nine months in the womb. |
| Psalms 22:32 | is stated: “They shall come and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall be born, that He has done this” | Sanhedrin 110b:12 | <b>It was stated: </b> With regard to <b>a minor</b> who dies, <b>from when, </b> i.e., from what stage, <b>does he come into the World-to-Come? </b> There is a dispute between <b>R' Ḥiyya and R' Shimon bar R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>One</b> of them <b>says: From the moment that he is born, and</b> the other <b>one says: From the moment that</b> he begins to <b>talk. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>The one who says: From the moment that he is born, </b> derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “They shall come and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall be born, that He has done this”</b> (Psalms 22:32). <b>And the one who says: From the moment that</b> he begins to <b>talk, </b> derives it from <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “Their seed shall serve Him; it shall be told of YHWH to the coming generation”</b> (Psalms 22:31), as from the moment he talks, he belongs to God. |
| Psalms 23:1 | “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” | Pesachim 118a:1 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the blessing of the song</b> mentioned in the Mishnah? <b>Rav Yehuda said: </b> It is the blessing that begins with: <b>They shall praise You, Lord, our God. And R' Yoḥanan said</b> that one also recites: <b>The breath of all living, </b> a prayer that follows the verses of praise [<i>pesukei dezimra</i>]. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>4th</b> cup, <b>one completes <i>hallel</i> over it and recites the great <i>hallel</i>; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Tarfon. And some say</b> that one recites: <b>“YHWH is my shepherd, I shall not want”</b> (Psalms 23:1), in appreciation of the food he ate at the meal. |
| Psalms 23:4 | is written: “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me” | Pesachim 111a:14 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of that which <b>is written: “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me”</b> (Psalms 23:4)? <b>This is</b> a person <b>who sleeps in the shadow of a single palm tree, and in the shadow of the moon. </b> Despite his dangerous position, he trusts God and is not afraid. The Talmud qualifies the previous statement: <b>And with regard to</b> one who sleeps <b>in the shadow of a single palm tree, we said</b> he is in danger <b>only if the shadow of another</b> palm tree <b>does not fall upon him. However, </b> if <b>the shadow of another</b> palm tree <b>falls upon him, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. </b> |
| Psalms 23:5 | my cup runs over” | Yoma 76a:9 | Similarly, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda said: The manna that fell for the Jewish people would accumulate and ascend until all the kings of the East and West could see it, as it is stated: “You prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies; </b> you anointed my head with oil; <b>my cup runs over”</b> (Psalms 23:5). God prepared food for the Jewish people, so that their enemies would see their greatness over the world. <b>“My cup runs over [<i>revaya</i>]”; Abaye said: We learn from this that the cup of David in the next world holds 221 <i>log</i>, since it is stated: “My cup runs over, ”</b> and the word <b><i>revaya</i> has that numerical value. </b> |
| Psalms 24:1 | “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof” | Arakhin 11b:20 | <b>Rava said, and some say Rav Ashi</b> said: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> the description of the destruction cited in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>The song of the day</b> for Sunday, which is when the <i>baraita</i> says that the Temple was destroyed, is the psalm that begins: <b>“The earth is YHWH’s, and the fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). And yet the verse that the <i>baraita</i> says that the Levites were singing, <b>“And He brought upon them their own iniquity, ” is in the song for Wednesday, </b> not the song for Sunday. <b>Rather, it was merely</b> a portentous <b>lamentation</b> [<b><i>eiliyya</i></b>] <b>that came into their mouths, </b> not an actual song recited over an offering. |
| Psalms 24:1 | The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof” | Arakhin 12a:4 | <b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ashi</b> who said: <b>And can you understand</b> that this song was recited over any offering? <b>The song of the day</b> for Sunday, which is when the <i>baraita</i> says that the Temple was destroyed, is the psalm beginning with the verse: “A psalm of David. <b>The earth is YHWH’s, and the fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). And yet the verse that the <i>baraita</i> says that the Levites were singing: <b>“And He brought upon them their own iniquity, ” is in the song for Wednesday, </b> not the song for Sunday. <b>Rather, it was merely</b> a portentous <b>lamentation that came into their mouths, </b> not a song recited over an offering. Consequently, no proof can be offered from this <i>baraita</i>. |
| Psalms 24:1 | Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s, | Berakhot 35a:21 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is YHWH’s, </b> the world and all those who live in it” (Psalms 24:1). R' Levi expressed this concept differently. <b>R' Levi raised a contradiction: It is written: “The earth and all it contains is YHWH’s, ” and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The heavens are YHWH’s and the earth He has given over to mankind”</b> (Psalms 115:16). There is clearly a contradiction with regard to whom the earth belongs. He himself resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here, </b> the verse that says that the earth is YHWH’s refers to the situation <b>before a blessing</b> is recited, |
| Psalms 24:1 | wherever it is, it is in the treasury [ bei gazza ] of the Merciful One, as it is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness thereof” | Chullin 139a:9 | <b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said: </b> Though it has rebelled, the chicken retains its sanctity, since <b>wherever it is, it is in the treasury [<i>bei gazza</i>] of God, as it is written: “The earth is YHWH’s, and its fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). <b>And so R' Yoḥanan says</b> that the Mishnah is referring <b>to</b> a case where one <b>consecrated his chicken for Temple maintenance, and</b> the chicken then <b>rebelled. R' Shimon ben Lakish said to him: But once it rebels, its sanctity is abrogated. </b> R' Yoḥanan <b>said to him: </b> Wherever it is, <b>it is in the treasury of God, as it is written: “The earth is YHWH’s, and its fullness thereof. ”</b> |
| Psalms 24:1 | as it is stated: “The earth is the Lord’s” | Gittin 47a:9 | <b>And R' Elazar says: Even though a non-Jew has</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to tithes: “The tithe of <b>your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), which teaches that it is only the grain of a Jew that is obligated in tithes <b>and not the grain of a non-Jew; a non-Jew does not have, however, </b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves, </b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The earth is YHWH’s”</b> (Psalms 24:1). |
| Psalms 24:1 | “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness” | Rosh Hashanah31a:2 | § The Talmud expands on the topic of the daily psalms recited by the Levites. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda said in the name of R' Akiva: On the first</b> day of the week, Sunday, <b>what</b> psalm <b>would</b> the Levites <b>recite? </b> The psalm beginning with the phrase: <b>“The earth is YHWH’s, and its fullness”</b> (Psalms 24:1), in commemoration of the first day of Creation, <b>because</b> on that day <b>He acquired</b> the world <b>and transferred</b> it to man, <b>and</b> He <b>was</b> the only <b>ruler in His world, </b> as the angels were not created until the second day. |
| Psalms 24:1 | say: “The earth and all that fills it is God’s, | Shabbat 119a:7 | With regard to <b>the wealthy of other countries, </b> where there are no rabbis, <b>by what</b> virtue <b>do they merit</b> their wealth? He <b>said to him: Because they honor Shabbat, as R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One time I was hosted at</b> the home of <b>a homeowner in Laodicea and</b> they <b>brought before him a table of gold</b> that was so heavy it required <b>sixteen people to carry it, and</b> there were <b>sixteen chains of silver attached to it, and</b> there were <b>bowls and cups and pitchers and flasks attached to it, and</b> there were <b>all sorts of food, and delicacies, and fragrant spices on it.

| Psalms 24:2 | which is written: “For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods” | Bava Batra74b:12 | § The Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the upcoming statements of Rav Dimi: <b>Seas; Gabriel; hungry. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods”</b> (Psalms 24:2)? <b>These are</b> the <b>seven seas and four rivers that surround Eretz Yisrael. And these are</b> the <b>seven seas: The Sea of Tiberias, the Sea of Sodom, </b> i.e., the Dead Sea, <b>the Sea of Ḥeilat, the Sea of Ḥeilata, the Sea of Sivkhi, the Sea of Aspamya, and the Great Sea, </b> i.e., the Mediterranean. <b>And these are the four rivers: The Jordan, the Jarmuth, and the Keiromyon, and the Piga, </b> which are the rivers of Damascus. |
| Psalms 24:4 | “He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not taken My name in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully” | Niddah 30b:24 | <b>And</b> a fetus <b>does not leave</b> the womb <b>until</b> the angels <b>administer an oath to it, as it is stated: “That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear”</b> (Isaiah 45:23). The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“That to Me every knee shall bow”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>death, as it is stated: “All those who go down to the dust shall kneel before Him”</b> (Psalms 22:30). <b>“Every tongue shall swear”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>birth, as it is stated</b> in description of a righteous person: <b>“He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not taken My name in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully”</b> (Psalms 24:4), i.e., he has kept the oath that he took before he was born. |
| Psalms 24:5 | And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from the Lord” | Chagigah 12b:12 | <b><i>Aravot</i>, </b> skies, is the firmament <b>that contains righteousness; justice; righteousness, </b> i.e., charity; <b>the treasuries of life; the treasuries of peace; the treasuries of blessing; the souls of the righteous; the spirits and souls that are to be created; and the dew that God will use to revive the dead. </b> The Talmud proves this statement: <b>Righteousness and justice</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>righteousness, as it is written: “And He donned righteousness as armor”</b> (Isaiah 59:17); <b>the treasuries of life, as it is written: “For with You is the source of life”</b> (Psalms 36:10). <b>And the treasuries of peace</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And he called Him YHWH of peace”</b> (Judges 6:24), implying that peace is God’s name and is therefore found close to Him. <b>And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from YHWH”</b> (Psalms 24:5). |
| Psalms 24:6 | “This is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Your face, Jacob. Selah” | Arakhin 17a:3 | § The verse states: <b>“This is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Your face, Jacob. Selah”</b> (Psalms 24:6). This verse teaches that the level of the generation and those who lead them, i.e., those who seek after Him, are the same. <b>R' Yehuda Nesia and the Rabbis disagree about this. One says: </b> The level of the <b>generation follows</b> the level of the <b>leader, and one says: </b> The level of the <b>leader follows</b> the level of <b>his generation. </b> |
| Psalms 24:7 | was not answered.

Immediately, the gates <b>ran after him to swallow him, </b> as they thought that in the words: “King of glory” he was referring to himself, <b>and they said</b> to him: <b>“Who is the King of glory? ”</b> (Psalms 24:8). <b>He said to them: “YHWH strong and mighty, </b> YHWH mighty in battle” (Psalms 24:8).

| Psalms 25:6 | through kindness and mercy, as it is written: “Remember Your mercies, O Lord, and Your kindnesses, for they are from times of old” | Chagigah 12a:14 | Scriptural proof is provided for this statement as follows: It was created <b>through wisdom and through understanding, as it is written: “YHWH founded earth with wisdom, and established the heavens with understanding”</b> (Proverbs 3:19); <b>through knowledge, as it is written: “With His knowledge the depths were broken up”</b> (Proverbs 3:20); <b>through strength and through might, as it is written: “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, who is girded about with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7); <b>through rebuke, as it is written: “The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke”</b> (Job 26:11); <b>through righteousness and justice, as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>through kindness and mercy, as it is written: “Remember Your mercies, O Lord, and Your kindnesses, for they are from times of old”</b> (Psalms 25:6). |
| Psalms 25:8 | with an introduction from here: “Good and upright is God; therefore He directs sinners along the way” | Makkot 10b:2 | § Apropos that <i>halakha</i>, the Talmud cites that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Ḥanina introduced this portion</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of exile <b>with an introduction from here: “Good and upright is God; therefore He directs sinners along the way”</b> (Psalms 25:8). He said: <b>If He directs sinners</b> by commanding the placing of signs directing them to the city of refuge, it may be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that He will assist and direct <b>the righteous</b> along the path of righteousness. |
| Psalms 25:14 | “The counsel of the Lord is with them who fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it” | Chagigah 3b:8 | R' Elazar <b>said to him</b> in anger: <b>Yosei, extend your hands and catch your eyes, </b> which are about to come out of their sockets. <b>He extended his hands and caught his eyes.

| Psalms 25:14 | “The counsel of the Lord is with those who fear Him; | Niddah 20b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>And why would they call</b> R' Elazar <b>the master of Eretz Yisrael</b> in wisdom? The Talmud explains that there was an incident <b>involving a certain woman who brought blood before R' Elazar</b> for examination, and <b>R' Ami was sitting before him. </b> R' Ami observed that R' Elazar <b>smelled</b> the blood and <b>said to</b> the woman: <b>This is blood of desire, </b> i.e., your desire for your husband caused you to emit this blood, and it is not the blood of menstruation. <b>After</b> the woman <b>left</b> R' Elazar’s presence, <b>R' Ami caught up with her</b> and inquired into the circumstances of her case. <b>She said to him: My husband was</b> absent <b>on a journey, and I desired him. </b> R' Ami <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about</b> R' Elazar: <b>“The counsel of YHWH is with those who fear Him; </b> and His covenant, to make them know it” (Psalms 25:14), i.e., God reveals secret matters to those who fear Him. |
| Psalms 25:14 | as it is written: “The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him” | Sanhedrin 106b:15 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: Doeg and Ahithophel did not comprehend halakhic discussions.

Rather, </b> Doeg and Ahithophel <b>would not conclude halakhic discussions in accordance with halakhic</b> rulings, <b>as it is written: “The secret of YHWH is with those who fear Him”</b> (Psalms 25:14). Since they did not fear God, they did not arrive at halakhic conclusions despite their keen intellect. |
| Psalms 25:14 | “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will show to them His covenant” | Sanhedrin 48b:17 | The curse of those who <b>“hold onto a staff”</b> was fulfilled among Solomon’s descendants <b>in Asa, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“But in the time of his old age, he was diseased in his feet”</b> (I Kings 15:23). <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> This means <b>that he was seized with gout [<i>podagra</i>].

Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: </b> The pain is <b>similar to</b> the pain of <b>a needle</b> piercing <b>live flesh. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>How did</b> Rav Naḥman <b>know</b> what gout is like? The Talmud answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that he himself <b>suffered from</b> the disease. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>he learned it</b> as a tradition <b>from his teacher.

| Psalms 25:14 | “The counsel of the Lord is with them who fear Him [ sod Hashem lire’av ]” | Shabbat 77b:11 | An outer garment is called <b><i>levusha</i>, </b> which is an acronym for <b><i>lo busha</i>, </b> which means no shame, as one who is clothed is no longer ashamed. A broad outer garment is called <b><i>gelima</i>, </b> an allusion to the fact that, by wearing it, one <b>is transformed into</b> an amorphous <b>golem-like</b> figure, as his limbs are indistinguishable. A beautiful coat is termed <b><i>golta</i>, </b> which is an acronym for <b><i>geli ve’eitiv</i>, </b> which means reveal, remove the coat, and only then I will sit, so that the coat will not get dirty. A bed is called <b><i>purya</i>, </b> an allusion to the fact that people <b><i>parin veravin</i>, </b> which means procreate, <b>upon it. </b> An empty pit is called <b><i>bor zinka</i>, </b> which is an acronym for <b><i>bor ze naki</i>, </b> which means that this pit is empty of water. The head covering of Torah scholars is called <b><i>sudara</i>, </b> an acronym for <i>sod yareh</i>, which is a reference to the verse: <b>“The counsel of YHWH is with them who fear Him [<i>sod Hashem lire’av</i>]”</b> (Psalms 25:14). A palace is called <b><i>apadna</i>, </b> which is an acronym for <b><i>apitḥa dein</i>, </b> meaning: To this entrance all come.

| Psalms 26:2 | said before Him: Examine me and subject me to an ordeal, as it is stated: “Examine me, Lord, and subject me to an ordeal; | Sanhedrin 107a:2 | § Apropos Ahithophel, the Talmud relates the events that led to his death. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A person should never bring himself to</b> undergo <b>an ordeal, as David, king of Israel, brought himself to</b> undergo <b>an ordeal and failed. </b> David <b>said before</b> God: <b>God!, for what</b> reason <b>does one say</b> in prayer: <b>God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, and one does not say: God of David? </b> God <b>said</b> to David: <b>They have undergone ordeals before Me, and you have not undergone an ordeal before Me. </b> David <b>said before Him: Examine me and subject me to an ordeal, as it is stated: “Examine me, Lord, and subject me to an ordeal; </b> try my kidneys and my heart” (Psalms 26:2). |

| Psalms 26:8 | David says: “Lord, I love the habitation of Your house” | Megillah 29a:8 | <b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Lord, You have been our dwelling place</b> in all generations” (Psalms 90:1)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>the synagogues and study halls. Abaye said: Initially, I used to study</b> Torah <b>in</b> my <b>home and pray in the synagogue. Once I heard</b> and understood <b>that which</b> King <b>David says: “Lord, I love the habitation of Your house”</b> (Psalms 26:8), <b>I would</b> always <b>study</b> Torah <b>in the synagogue, </b> to express my love for the place in which the Shekhina resides. |
| Psalms 26:11 | I will walk with my integrity” | Sanhedrin 89b:12 | <b>Satan preceded</b> Abraham <b>to the path</b> that he took to bind his son and <b>said to him: “If one ventures a word to you, will you be weary…you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. Your words have upheld him that was falling…but now it comes upon you, and you are weary”</b> (Job 4:2–5). Do you now regret what you are doing? Abraham <b>said to him</b> in response: “And <b>I will walk with my integrity”</b> (Psalms 26:11). |
| Psalms 27:13 | believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” | Berakhot 4a:14 | With regard to David’s statement, “Keep my soul, for I am pious,” the Talmud asks: <b>Did David call himself pious? Isn’t it written: “If I had not [<i>luleh</i></b>] <b>believed to look upon the goodness of YHWH in the land of the living”</b> (Psalms 27:13). The dots that appear over the word <i>luleh</i> in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see <i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i> 34). <b>In the name of R' Yosei, it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Why</b> do <b>dots</b> appear <b>over the word <i>luleh</i>, </b> as if there are some reservations? Because <b>David said before God: God!. I</b> have every <b>confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come</b> since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, <b>but</b> I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and <b>I do not know whether or not I</b> definitely <b>have a portion among them. </b> In any case, apparently David was uncertain whether or not he deserved to receive a portion of God’s reward for the righteous; how, then, could he characterize himself as pious? |
| Psalms 27:14 | pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord” | Berakhot 32b:10 | On a similar note, <b>R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, said: A person who prayed and saw that he was not answered</b> should <b>pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in YHWH, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in YHWH”</b> (Psalms 27:14). One should turn to God with hope, and if necessary turn to God again with hope. |
| Psalms 29:1 | As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord, mighty ones” | Megillah 17b:9 | The Talmud proceeds to explain this order: <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one says</b> the blessing of <b>the Patriarchs, </b> the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i>? <b>As it is stated: “Ascribe to YHWH, mighty ones”</b> (Psalms 29:1), which means that one should mention before YHWH the mighty ones of the world, i.e., the Patriarchs. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> then <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>mighty deeds? As it is stated</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“Ascribe to YHWH glory and strength”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> then <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>holiness? As it is stated</b> in the next verse: <b>“Give to YHWH the glory due to His name; worship YHWH in the beauty of holiness”</b> (Psalms 29:2). |
| Psalms 29:1 | Patriarchs? As it is stated: “Ascribe to the Lord, O you sons of the mighty” | Rosh Hashanah32a:6 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites</b> the blessing of the <b>Patriarchs?

| Psalms 29:1 | “Ascribe [ havu ] unto the Lord, O you sons of might” | Sukkah 55a:4 | <b>And furthermore, </b> contrary to the statement of R' Aḥa, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the intermediate days of the Festival, on the first</b> day, <b>what would they say</b> as the song accompanying the offering on that day? <b>“Ascribe [<i>havu</i>] unto YHWH, O you sons of might”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>On the second</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm that contains the verse: <b>“But unto the wicked [<i>velarasha</i>] God says: </b> What have you to do to declare My statutes? ” (Psalms 50:16). <b>On the 3rd</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm containing the verse: <b>“Who [<i>mi</i>] will rise up for me against the evildoers? ”</b> (Psalms 94:16). |
| Psalms 29:2 | bow to the Lord in the beauty of holiness [ behadrat kodesh ]” | Berakhot 30b:18 | The Talmud rejects this proof as well: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps David is different, as he would excessively afflict himself in prayer</b> in order to atone for his transgression with Bathsheba. Consequently, his cannot serve as a paradigm for proper conduct in prayer. <b>Rather, R' Yehoshua ben Levi said, </b> it can be derived <b>from here, </b> from this verse that David said, not about his own worship, but about worship of God in general: “Give, unto YHWH, the honor of His name, <b>bow to YHWH in the beauty of holiness [<i>behadrat kodesh</i>]”</b> (Psalms 29:2). <b>Do not read: In the beauty of [<i>behadrat</i>]</b> holiness. <b>Rather</b> read: <b>In trembling of [<i>beḥerdat</i>]</b> holiness; one must enter into prayer from an atmosphere of gravity engendered by sanctity. |
| Psalms 29:2 | “Give to the Lord the glory due to His name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” | Megillah 17b:9 | The Talmud proceeds to explain this order: <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one says</b> the blessing of <b>the Patriarchs, </b> the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i>? <b>As it is stated: “Ascribe to YHWH, mighty ones”</b> (Psalms 29:1), which means that one should mention before YHWH the mighty ones of the world, i.e., the Patriarchs. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> then <b>says</b> the blessing of <b>mighty deeds?

| Psalms 29:8 | “The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness” | Rosh Hashanah30b:12 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the daily offering on Rosh HaShana, </b> in <b>the morning it is sacrificed in accordance with its</b> regular <b><i>halakhot</i>, </b> i.e., the Levites recite the regular psalm for that day of the week. When it comes <b>to the additional offering</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite? </b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:2). With regard <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon</b> offering, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite? </b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“The voice of YHWH shakes the wilderness”</b> (Psalms 29:8). |
| Psalms 29:9 | and in his palace all say: Glory” | Zevachim 116a:22 | <b>R' Elazar HaModa’i says: He heard</b> about <b>the giving of the Torah and came. As when the Torah was given to the Jewish people, the voice of</b> God, <b>went from</b> one <b>end of the world to the</b> other <b>end, and all of the kings of the nations of the world were overcome with trembling in their palaces and recited a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: </b> “The voice of YHWH makes the hinds to calve…<b>and in his palace all say: Glory”</b> (Psalms 29:9), i.e., each king in his own palace recited songs of praise to God. |
| Psalms 29:10 | the world, as it is stated: “The Lord sat enthroned at the flood” | Zevachim 116a:23 | At that time, <b>all of</b> the kings <b>gathered around Balaam the wicked, </b> who was the greatest non-Jew prophet, <b>and said to him: What is the tumultuous sound, </b> i.e., the loud noise, <b>that we have heard? Perhaps a flood is coming to</b> destroy <b>the world, as it is stated: “YHWH sat enthroned at the flood”</b> (Psalms 29:10)? Balaam <b>said to them: “YHWH sits as King forever”</b> (Psalms 29:10), which means that <b>God already took an oath</b> after the flood <b>never to bring a flood to the world, </b> as it is stated: “And the waters shall no more become a flood” (Genesis 9:15). |
| Psalms 29:11 | “May the Lord give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The rabbis interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. </b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of YHWH, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May YHWH give strength to His people; YHWH will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 29:11 | refers to phylacteries, as it is stated: “The Lord gave strength to His nation” | Berakhot 6a:18 | Specifically, <b>“His right hand” refers to the Torah, as it is stated</b> in describing the giving of the Torah: <b>“From His right hand, a fiery law for His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>“The arm of His strength, ”</b> His left hand, <b>refers to tefillin, as it is stated: “YHWH gave strength to His nation”</b> (Psalms 29:11), in the form of the mitzva of tefillin. |
| Psalms 29:11 | the blessing of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is peace, as it is stated: “The Lord blesses His people with peace” | Megillah 18a:7 | <b>And why did they see</b> fit to institute that one <b>says</b> the blessing beginning with the words: <b>Grant peace, after the Priestly Benediction? As it is written</b> immediately following the Priestly Benediction: <b>“And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27). The Priestly Benediction is followed by God’s blessing, and <b>the blessing of God is peace, as it is stated: “YHWH blesses His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 29:11 | 974 generations before the world was created, and He seeks to give it to his children, as it is stated: “The Lord will give strength to His people” | Zevachim 116a:25 | They asked: <b>And</b> if so, <b>what is this tumultuous sound that we have heard? </b> Balaam <b>said to them: He has a good</b> and <b>precious item in His treasury, that was hidden away with Him</b> for <b>974 generations before the world was created, and He seeks to give it to his children, as it is stated: “YHWH will give strength to His people”</b> (Psalms 29:11). “Strength” is a reference to the Torah, which is the strength of the Jewish people. <b>Immediately, they all began to say: “YHWH will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 30:6 | a moment? As it is written: “His anger is but for a moment; His favor, for a lifetime” | Avodah Zarah4b:6 | The Talmud further discusses this matter: <b>And how</b> long does <b>His indignation</b> last? It lasts <b>a moment. And how</b> long is <b>a moment? Ameimar, and some say Ravina, said: </b> It lasts <b>as</b> long as it takes <b>to say</b> the word <b>moment [<i>rega</i>]. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> God’s <b>anger</b> lasts for only <b>a moment? As it is written: “His anger is but for a moment; His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Psalms 30:6 | angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime” | Berakhot 7a:15 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that God <b>is</b> only <b>angry for a moment? As it is stated: “His anger is but for a moment, His favor, for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead, <b>from here, </b> as it is stated: <b>“Hide yourself for a brief moment, until the anger passes”</b> (Isaiah 26:20), meaning that God’s anger passes in a mere moment. |
| Psalms 30:6 | one moment, as it is stated: “For His anger endures but a moment; His favor is for a lifetime” | Sanhedrin 105b:7 | <b>That is what Balaam said to Balak: “How can I curse, whom God has not cursed? </b> And how can I condemn, whom God has not condemned? ” (Numbers 23:8). Since God did not become angry, Balaam was unable to curse the Jewish people. It is written: “And <b>God is angry every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12). <b>And how long is</b> the duration of <b>His wrath? </b> It is <b>one moment, as it is stated: “For His anger endures but a moment; His favor is for a lifetime”</b> (Psalms 30:6). |
| Psalms 30:12 | You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>Three transformations: </b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing; </b><b><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12); <b><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; </b><b><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12); <b>and: <b>“Nevertheless YHWH your God would not hearken unto Balaam; </b><br><b>but YHWH your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Psalms 30:13 | repeat it during the day, as it is stated: “So that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent; O Lord, my God, I will give thanks to You forever” | Megillah 4a:10 | The Talmud notes that this ruling <b>was also stated</b> by another <i>amora</i>, as <b>R' Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Ulla Bira’a said: A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>repeat it during the day, as it is stated: “So that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent; O Lord, my God, I will give thanks to You forever”</b> (Psalms 30:13). The dual formulation of singing praise and not being silent alludes to reading the Megilla both by night and by day. |
| Psalms 31:6 | Abaye said: Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse of prayer, such as: “Into Your hand I trust my spirit; You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth” | Berakhot 5a:1 | <b>If one is a Torah scholar, he need not</b> recite <i>Shema</i> on his bed since he is always engaged in the study of Torah and will likely fall asleep engrossed in matters of Torah. <b>Abaye said: Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse of prayer, such as: “Into Your hand I trust my spirit; You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth”</b> (Psalms 31:6). |
| Psalms 31:11 | Sin, as it is written: “My strength fails because of my sin” | Gittin 70a:19 | § <b>Three things diminish a person’s strength, and they are: Fear, </b> traveling on the <b>road, and sin. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>Fear, as it is written: “My heart flutters, my strength fails me”</b> (Psalms 38:11). Traveling on the <b>road, as it is written: “He has weakened my strength on the road”</b> (Psalms 102:24). <b>Sin, as it is written: “My strength fails because of my sin”</b> (Psalms 31:11). |
| Psalms 31:13 | as it is stated: “I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a lost vessel” | Berakhot 58b:6 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees his friend after thirty days</b> have passed since last seeing him <b>recites: Blessed…Who has given us life, sustained us and brought us to this time. </b> One who sees his friend <b>after twelve months recites: Blessed…Who revives the dead. </b> As <b>Rav said: A dead person is only forgotten from the heart after twelve months</b> have elapsed, <b>as it is stated: “I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a lost vessel”</b> (Psalms 31:13), and with regard to the laws of lost objects, it is human nature to despair of recovering a lost object after twelve months (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 28a). |
| Psalms 31:19 | And Reish Lakish says: He brings a curse upon himself, as it is stated: “Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak arrogantly against the righteous, | Bava Metzia75b:10 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Whoever has money and lends it not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses violates</b> the prohibition of: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as this tempts the borrower not to repay his debt. <b>And Reish Lakish says: He brings a curse upon himself, as it is stated: “Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak arrogantly against the righteous, </b> with pride and contempt” (Psalms 31:19), as when the lender comes to claim his money without any proof, people will think he is falsely accusing the borrower, and they will end up cursing him. |
| Psalms 31:20 | one said to him: It was read to me in my dream: “How abundant is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You” | Sotah 31a:12 | It happened that there were <b>these two students who were sitting before Rava, </b> and <b>one said to him: It was read to me in my dream: “How abundant is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You”</b> (Psalms 31:20). <b>And one said to</b> Rava: <b>It was read to me in my dream: “So shall all those who take refuge in You rejoice; they will forever shout for joy, </b> and You will shelter them; <b>let them also who love Your name exult in You”</b> (Psalms 5:12). Rava <b>said to them: You are both completely righteous rabbis. </b> One <b>Sage, </b> the second dreamer, serves God <b>out of love, and</b> one <b>Sage, </b> the first dreamer, serves God <b>out of fear. </b> Each Sage’s dream corresponded to his manner of serving God. |
| Psalms 32:1 | Rav Kahana also said: I consider impudent one who specifies his transgression, as it is stated: “Happy is he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose transgression is covered over” | Berakhot 34b:31 | Employing parallel language, <b>Rav Kahana also said: I consider impudent one who specifies his transgression, as it is stated: “Happy is he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose transgression is covered over”</b> (Psalms 32:1); one who conceals his transgressions indicates that he is ashamed of them, and due to his shame he will be forgiven. |
| Psalms 32:1 | “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden” | Yoma 86b:14 | Furthermore, during confession, <b>one must detail the sin</b> he committed and not suffice with a general admission of sin, <b>as it is stated: </b> “And Moses returned to YHWH and said: <b>Please, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves a god of gold”</b> (Exodus 32:31); this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda ben Bava. R' Akiva says</b> that the verse states: <b>“Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden”</b> (Psalms 32:1), which teaches that one need not detail his sins. <b>But what is</b> the meaning of that <b>which Moses said: “And have made themselves a god of gold”</b> (Exodus 32:31)? It should be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of R' Yannai, as R' Yannai said: Moses said before God: God!, </b> it is the <b>silver and gold that you gave to the Jewish people in abundance, until they said: Enough, </b> which <b>caused them to make a god of gold. </b> Consequently, the phrase: “And have made themselves a god of gold,” is not a description of the sin but an explanation and justification of it. |
| Psalms 32:1 | David said: Let my disgrace not be written, as it is stated: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden” | Yoma 86b:15 | It is said that <b>two good leaders arose for the Jewish people: Moses and David. Moses said: Let my disgrace be written, </b> i.e., may the sin I committed be written explicitly, <b>as it is stated: “Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me”</b> (Numbers 20:12). In contrast, <b>David said: Let my disgrace not be written, as it is stated: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden”</b> (Psalms 32:1). |
| Psalms 32:1 | Rav raised a contradiction: It is written: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden” | Yoma 86b:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav raised a contradiction: It is written: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden”</b> (Psalms 32:1), implying that it is inappropriate for one to reveal his sins, <b>and it is written: “He who hides his transgressions shall not prosper”</b> (Proverbs 28:13). He resolved the contradiction as follows: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring to <b>a publicized sin; </b> since his sin is public knowledge it is fitting for him to also publicize his repentance. <b>There, </b> it is referring <b>to a sin that is not publicized, </b> in which case it is inappropriate to publicize one’s repentance. <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviya</b> said that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Here, </b> it is referring <b>to sins a person commits against another; </b> he must publicize his repentance so that those who hear him may persuade the other to forgive him. <b>There, </b> it is referring <b>to sins a person commits against God, </b> in which case he need not repent publicly. |
| Psalms 32:6 | “For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding, | Berakhot 8a:9 | Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Talmud seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding, </b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>R' Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife, </b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from YHWH” (Proverbs 18:22). |
| Psalms 33:1 | which is written: “Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, praise is comely for the upright [ nava tehilla ]” | Sotah 9a:13 | Having mentioned Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, the Talmud quotes another of his interpretations. <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Rejoice in YHWH, you righteous, praise is comely for the upright [<i>nava tehilla</i>]”</b> (Psalms 33:1)? <b>Do not read</b> the conclusion of the verse as: <b>Praise is comely [<i>nava</i>]; rather, </b> read it as: <b>A house [<i>naveh</i>] of praise. This</b> is referring to <b>Moses and David, whose enemies did not rule over their achievements, </b> as they each built a <i>naveh</i>, a house for YHWH, and this house remained in existence. |
| Psalms 33:5 | as though he filled the whole world in its entirety with kindness, as it is stated: “He loves charity and justice; the earth is full of the kindness of the Lord” | Sukkah 49b:12 | <b>And R' Elazar said: Anyone who performs charity and justice is</b> considered <b>as though he filled the whole world in its entirety with kindness, as it is stated: “He loves charity and justice; the earth is full of the kindness of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 33:5). <b>Lest you say that anyone who comes to leap</b> and perform an act of kindness may simply <b>leap</b> and do so without scrutiny, <b>the verse states: “How precious is your kindness, O God”</b> (Psalms 36:8). It is a precious and rare occurrence to perform an act of kindness properly. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a God-fearing</b> individual does not always encounter the opportunity to perform acts of kindness. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But the kindness of YHWH is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him”</b> (Psalms 103:17). |
| Psalms 33:6 | each and every word that emerges from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, an angel is created, as it is stated: “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their hosts” | Chagigah 14a:3 | <b>Shmuel said to Ḥiyya bar Rav: Son of great ones, come and I will tell you something of the great things that your father would say: Each and every day, ministering angels are created from the River Dinur, and they recite song</b> to God <b>and</b> then immediately <b>cease</b> to exist, <b>as it is stated: “They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness”</b> (Lamentations 3:23), indicating that new angels praise God each morning. The Talmud comments: <b>And</b> this opinion <b>disagrees with</b> that <b>of R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani, as R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: </b> With <b>each and every word that emerges from the mouth of God an angel is created, as it is stated: “By the word of YHWH the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their hosts”</b> (Psalms 33:6). The hosts of heaven are the angels, who, he claims, are created from the mouth of God, rather than from the River Dinur. |
| Psalms 33:6 | an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth” | Megillah 21b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>What are these</b> ten utterances? Presumably, they are the utterances introduced by the words <b>“and</b> God <b>said”</b> in the story of Creation in the first chapter of <b>Genesis. </b> However, <b>there are</b> only <b>nine of these</b> utterances and not ten. The Talmud answers: The expression: <b>“In the beginning”</b> (Genesis 1:1) <b>is also</b> considered <b>an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of YHWH were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth”</b> (Psalms 33:6), which indicates that the first utterance of Creation was the general creation of the entire universe. |
| Psalms 33:6 | an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made” | Rosh Hashanah32a:19 | The Talmud asks: Does it refer to the repetition of the phrase: <b>“And He said” in Genesis? There are</b> only <b>nine</b> such phrases, not ten. The Talmud answers that the phrase <b>“In the beginning” is also</b> considered <b>an utterance, as it is written: “By the word of YHWH were the heavens made”</b> (Psalms 33:6), which indicates that all of creation came into existence through a single utterance, after which all matter was formed into separate and distinct entities by means of the other nine utterances. |
| Psalms 33:6 | that speech is like action? As it is stated: “By the word of God the heavens were made, | Shabbat 119b:2 | <b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> who said: <b>Even an individual who prays on Shabbat evening must recite</b> the passage: “And the heavens and the earth <b>were finished [<i>vaykhullu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:1–3), <b>as Rav Hamnuna said: Anyone who prays on Shabbat evening and recites</b> the passage of <b>vaykhullu, the verse ascribed him</b> credit <b>as if he became a partner with God in the act of Creation. As it is stated: </b> “And the heavens and the earth <b>were finished [<i>vaykhullu</i>]. ” Do not read</b> it as: <b>Were finished [<i>vaykhullu</i>]; rather, </b> as: <b>They finished [<i>vaykhallu</i>]. </b> It is considered as though God and the individual who says this become partners and completed the work together. <b>R' Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that speech is like action? As it is stated: “By the word of God the heavens were made, </b> and all of their hosts by the breath of His mouth” (Psalms 33:6). |
| Psalms 33:7 | Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: When Rabbi Yonatan would reach this verse he would cry. He about whom it is written: “He gathers [ kones ] the waters of the sea like a rampart” | Sanhedrin 103b:9 | <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“For the bed is too short for spreading”? R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says</b> that it means: <b>For his bed is too narrow for two colleagues to spread upon it together, </b> as it is impossible that service of God and idol worship will coexist there. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and the covering [<i>masekha</i>] too narrow [<i>tzara</i>]</b> for when he gathers himself [<i>kehitkanes</i>]”? <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: When R' Yonatan would reach this verse he would cry. He about whom it is written: “He gathers [<i>kones</i>] the waters of the sea like a rampart”</b> (Psalms 33:7), <b>shall a graven image [<i>masekha</i>] be a rival [<i>tzara</i>]? </b> |
| Psalms 33:7 | “He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; he lays up the deep in storerooms” | Taanit 9b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which R' Ḥanina said, </b> concerning the verse: <b>“He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; he lays up the deep in storerooms”</b> (Psalms 33:7): <b>What caused the storerooms to be filled with produce? </b> It was <b>the deep, </b> which is the source of the water that nourishes the produce. The Talmud answers: This explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer. And R' Yehoshua, </b> how does he explain this verse? R' Yehoshua would say: <b>That</b> |
| Psalms 33:7 | said: For He about Whom it is written: “He gathers [ kones ] waters of the sea together as a heap” | Yoma 9b:5 | <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>And the cover [<i>vehamasseikha</i>] is too narrow [<i>tzara</i>] for gathering [<i>kehitkannes</i>]?

| Psalms 33:9 | that which is written: | Shabbat 152a:12 | The Talmud relates that <b>Rav Kahana was reading</b> biblical <b>verses before Rav. When he got to this verse, </b> Rav <b>sighed. </b> Rav Kahana <b>said: </b> We can <b>derive from this that Rav’s desire has ceased. Rav Kahana</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: </b> “For He spoke and it was, He commanded and it stood” (Psalms 33:9)? He understands this to mean that God created man with desires that push him to do things he would not do if he acted purely on the judgment of his intellect, and Rav Kahana therefore interprets the verse in the following manner: <b>“For He spoke and it was”; this is a woman</b> that a man marries. <b>“He commanded and it stood”; these are the children</b> who one works hard to raise. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman is</b> essentially <b>a flask full of feces, </b> a reference to the digestive system, <b>and her mouth is full of blood, </b> a euphemistic reference to menstruation, yet men are not deterred <b>and they all run after her</b> with desire. |
| Psalms 33:15 | a tree; on Rosh HaShana all creatures pass before Him like sheep [ benei maron ], as it is stated: “He Who fashions their hearts alike, Who considers all their deeds” | Rosh Hashanah16a:1 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>At four times</b> of the year <b>the world is judged: On Passover</b> judgment is passed <b>concerning grain; on <i>Shavuot</i> concerning fruits</b> that grow on <b>a tree; on Rosh HaShana all creatures pass before Him like sheep [<i>benei maron</i>], as it is stated: “He Who fashions their hearts alike, Who considers all their deeds”</b> (Psalms 33:15); <b>and on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>they are judged concerning water, </b> i.e., the rainfall of the coming year. |
| Psalms 33:15 | “He who fashions their hearts alike, who considers all their deeds” | Rosh Hashanah18a:14 | <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: And they are all scanned in a single scan. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, learn</b> this in the <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He who fashions their hearts alike, who considers all their deeds”</b> (Psalms 33:15). <b>What is this</b> verse <b>saying? If we say this is what it is saying: That He created everyone and unites</b> all <b>their hearts together, </b> there is a difficulty, <b>since don’t we see that it is not so, </b> as the hearts of people are not united and are not similar to one another? <b>Rather, is this not what it is saying: The Creator sees their hearts together and considers all their deeds</b> with a single scan? |
| Psalms 34:3 | “Praise God with me | Berakhot 48b:6 | <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is not necessary</b> to interpret the verse this way; rather, it should be understood in a slightly different manner, as follows: <b>“And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless, ” that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all; <b>however, the <i>zimmun</i> blessing is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“Praise God with me</b> and we will exalt His name together” (Psalms 34:3). He continues: <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land. Good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: This good mountain and Lebanon. They instituted</b> the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, at Yavne</b> and, as such, it has no biblical source. However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>The verse states: That he gave you. </b> A blessing must be recited over food <b>from</b> the moment that God <b>gave it to you, </b> not only afterward. |
| Psalms 34:4 | Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together” | Berakhot 45a:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the basic mitzva of <i>zimmun</i>, the Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived<b>, </b> that after a meal in which three diners participated, a <i>zimmun</i> must be recited? <b>Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together”</b> (Psalms 34:4), i.e., the one reciting the blessing turns to at least two others to praise God together. <b>R' Abbahu said: </b> The source of the mitzva of <i>zimmun</i> is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “When I call the Name of YHWH, give</b> [plural] <b>praise to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). |
| Psalms 34:8 | states: “The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him, and delivers them” | Menachot 43b:12 | <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Anyone who has tefillin on his head, tefillin on his arm, ritual fringes on his garment, and a <i>mezuza</i> on his doorway is strengthened</b> from <b>all</b> sides <b>so that he will not sin, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). This is interpreted as an allusion to the three mitzvot of tefillin, ritual fringes, and <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “The angel of YHWH encamps round about them that fear Him, and delivers them”</b> (Psalms 34:8). This is interpreted to mean that the angel of YHWH surrounds those who fulfill the mitzvot and saves them from sin. |
| Psalms 34:8 | that it is written: “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them [ vayeḥaltzem ]” | Yevamot 102b:11 | The Talmud challenges further: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that it is written: “The angel of YHWH encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them [<i>vayeḥaltzem</i>]”</b> (Psalms 34:8), doesn’t <i>vayeḥaltzem</i> rather mean: He shall strengthen them? The Talmud answers: The verse means: <b>As a reward for those that fear Him, He shall deliver them from the judgment of Gehenna. </b> Therefore, the Talmud interprets <i>vayeḥaltzem</i> as “delivers them,” not as: Strengthens them. |
| Psalms 34:15 | “Depart from evil, and do good; | Avodah Zarah19b:10 | The psalm continues: <b>“Depart from evil, and do good; </b> seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15). The Talmud explains: <b>Lest one say: I have kept my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile, I will</b> therefore <b>go and indulge in sleep. </b> To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states: “Depart from evil, and do good, ”</b> i.e., it is not enough to avoid evil, but one must actively do good. And the word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion; My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). |
| Psalms 34:15 | greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it” | Berakhot 6b:37 | <b>And R' Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who is aware that another</b> person <b>is accustomed to greet him</b> is not only obligated to return his greeting, but <b>he</b> must <b>greet him first, as it is stated: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>If</b> the other person <b>extended</b> his <b>greeting to him and he did not respond, he is called a robber, as it is stated: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard, the spoils of the poor is in your houses”</b> (Isaiah 3:14). The only way to steal from a pauper who owns nothing is to rob him of his dignity by refusing to return his greeting. |
| Psalms 34:15 | And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it” | Kiddushin 40a:6 | <b>And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>And R' Abbahu says: </b> This <b>is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the term <b>pursuing</b> written with regard to pursuing peace and the term <b>pursuing</b> written in another verse. <b>It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it, ” and it is written there, </b> with regard to acts of kindness: <b>“Pursues righteousness and kindness. ”</b> This teaches that one who pursues peace will also merit life, prosperity, and honor. <b>With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). |
| Psalms 34:15 | bringing about peace, as it is written “Seek peace and pursue it” | Yevamot 109a:19 | One should cling to <b>bringing about peace, as it is written “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). |
| Psalms 34:15 | pursuit. It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it” | Yevamot 109b:1 | <b>And R' Abbahu said: It is derived</b> by verbal analogy from the terms <b>pursuit</b> and <b>pursuit. It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15) <b>and it is written there: “He who pursues righteousness and mercy finds life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), indicating that pursuing peace is a mitzva, just as pursuing righteousness and mercy is. As <b>for the nullification of vows, this is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Natan says: </b> With regard to <b>one who vows, it is as if he built</b> a personal <b>altar</b> when it is prohibited to build an altar outside the Temple. <b>And one who fulfills that</b> vow, <b>it is as if he sacrificed an offering on this</b> personal altar, thereby doubling his sin. Therefore, it is preferable that he ask a halakhic authority to dissolve the vow. |
| Psalms 34:22 | “Evil shall kill the wicked” | Sanhedrin 81b:11 | The Talmud clarifies: <b>And what</b> is the nature of this <b>vaulted chamber? Rav Yehuda says: </b> It is a small chamber that is <b>the full height of</b> the transgressor, and it does not allow him to move in it. The Talmud asks: <b>And where</b> is this punishment <b>intimated? Reish Lakish said</b> that it is intimated in the verse: <b>“Evil shall kill the wicked”</b> (Psalms 34:22). Ultimately, an evildoer finds his demise through his evil, and the result is this harsh form of death. |
| Psalms 35:10 | As it is written: “All of my bones shall say: Lord, who is like You” | Berakhot 25a:4 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: He is prohibited from reciting <i>Shema</i>. What is the reason for Rav Ḥisda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “All of my bones shall say: Lord, who is like You”</b> (Psalms 35:10). Since this praise is undertaken with one’s entire body, he may not recite <i>Shema</i> even if just one limb is not appropriately clean. |
| Psalms 35:13 | “But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, | Berakhot 12b:8 | The Talmud seeks to clarify the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need of mercy? <b>If you say</b> that it is <b>because</b> of what Saul said to his men, <b>as it is written: “And there is none of you that is ill over me or tells unto me”</b> (I Samuel 22:8), meaning that because Saul was a Torah scholar, it would have been appropriate for people to make themselves ill worrying about him; this is not an absolute proof. <b>Perhaps a king is different, </b> and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is <b>from here: </b> When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: <b>“But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, </b> I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13). One must be concerned to the extent that he dresses in sackcloth and fasts for the recovery of a Torah scholar. |
| Psalms 35:15 | which is written: “And when I limped they rejoiced and gathered…they tore and did not cease [ damu ]” | Bava Metzia59a:1 | <b>It is preferable for a person to have sex with a woman</b> whose <b>married</b> status is <b>uncertain and not humiliate another in public. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Talmud answers: It is <b>from that which Rava interpreted, as Rava interpreted: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when I limped they rejoiced and gathered…they tore and did not cease [<i>damu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 35:15)? The term “<i>damu</i>” can also be understood as a reference to blood. Concerning the fasting he undertook to atone for his sin with Bathsheba (see II Samuel, chapters 11–12), <b>David said before God: God!, it is revealed and known before You that if</b> my tormenters <b>were to tear my flesh, my blood [<i>dami</i>] would not flow to the ground, </b> due to excessive fasting. |
| Psalms 35:15 | which is written: “And when I limped they rejoiced and gathered, the wretched gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; they tore and did not cease [ dammu ]” | Sanhedrin 107a:10 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when I limped they rejoiced and gathered, the wretched gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; they tore and did not cease [<i>dammu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 35:15)? <b>David said before God: God!. It is revealed and known before you that if</b> my enemies <b>were to tear my flesh, my blood [<i>dami</i>] would not flow to the ground, </b> due to excessive fasting (see II Samuel 12:16–17). |
| Psalms 35:16 | which is written: “With the flattering mockeries of spitefulness [ maog ] they gnash at me with their teeth” | Sanhedrin 52a:14 | This latter explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “With the flattering mockeries of spitefulness [<i>maog</i>] they gnash at me with their teeth”</b> (Psalms 35:16)? It means that <b>because of the flattery</b> of those people <b>who flattered Korah over matters of eating, </b> i.e., because of the food and drink that he would give them, <b>the minister of Gehenna gnashed his teeth over them, </b> as they eventually sinned and fell into his hands. The word <i>maog</i> is interpreted homiletically here as alluding to <i>uga</i>, cake. |
| Psalms 36:2 | evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart. The <b>evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes”</b> (Psalms 36:2). <b>Middling people are ruled by both</b> the good and evil inclinations, <b>as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul”</b> (Psalms 109:31). |
| Psalms 36:7 | “Your benevolence is like the mighty mountains” | Arakhin 8b:11 | § <b>Rav Pappa says: </b> In the phrase: <b>“Your benevolence is like the mighty mountains”</b> (Psalms 36:7), <b>these</b> acts of benevolence are referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that affect <b>a person. </b> When God punishes someone with benevolence, He afflicts the individual with leprous symptoms on his body that can be resolved in just one week. When the verse continues with the phrase, <b>“Your judgments are like the great deep, ” these</b> judgments are referring to <b>leprous marks</b> that appear on <b>houses, </b> the status of which can take up to three weeks to be determined. |
| Psalms 36:7 | a deficiency? But isn’t it written: “Man and animal You preserve, Lord” | Chullin 5b:5 | § In the previous <i>baraita</i> the rabbis derived from the phrase “from the animal” that people who are similar to an animal are included among those from whom offerings are accepted. The Talmud seeks to understand the meaning of the phrase: Similar to an animal, and asks: <b>And everywhere that</b> the word <b>animal is written</b> and interpreted as referring to a person, does it indicate <b>a deficiency? But isn’t it written: “Man and animal You preserve, Lord”</b> (Psalms 36:7), <b>and Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: These are people who are clever in</b> terms of their <b>intellect, </b> like people, <b>and</b> despite their intelligence they <b>comport themselves</b> humbly and self-effacingly, <b>like an animal. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>There it is written “man and animal. ” Here, </b> the word <b>“animal” alone is written. </b> |
| Psalms 36:7 | say: “Your judgments are like the great deep” | Chullin 63a:4 | The Talmud recounts: <b>When R' Yoḥanan would see a <i>shalakh</i>, he</b> would <b>say: “Your judgments are like the great deep”</b> (Psalms 36:7), as God exacts retribution even upon the fish in the sea. <b>When he would see an ant, he</b> would <b>say</b> the first half of the same verse: <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, ”</b> as God provides sustenance for the tiny ant just as He does for the largest creatures. |
| Psalms 36:7 | “Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains” | Nedarim 37b:8 | <b>The ornamentation of the scribes</b> are expressions that the scribes understood in a manner that differs slightly from its plain understanding. For example: <b>“Then [<i>aḥar</i>] go on”</b> (Genesis 18:5); <b>“then [<i>aḥar</i>] she will go”</b> (Genesis 24:55); <b>“afterward [<i>aḥar</i>] you will be gathered”</b> (Numbers 31:2); <b>“the singers go before, the minstrels follow after [<i>aḥar</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:26); <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains”</b> (Psalms 36:7). |
| Psalms 36:7 | anyone who starves himself over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, satisfies him in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: | Sanhedrin 100a:14 | <b>R' Tanḥum ben Ḥanilai, says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who starves himself over matters of Torah in this world, God satisfies him in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: </b> “Your judgments are like the great deep” (Psalms 36:7), indicating that God is exacting with the righteous and does not reward them in this world, and it is stated thereafter: <b>“They are abundantly satisfied with the plenty of Your house, and You feed them drink of the river of Your pleasures”</b> (Psalms 36:9). |
| Psalms 36:8 | the verse states: “How precious is your kindness, O God” | Sukkah 49b:12 | <b>And R' Elazar said: Anyone who performs charity and justice is</b> considered <b>as though he filled the whole world in its entirety with kindness, as it is stated: “He loves charity and justice; the earth is full of the kindness of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 33:5). <b>Lest you say that anyone who comes to leap</b> and perform an act of kindness may simply <b>leap</b> and do so without scrutiny, <b>the verse states: “How precious is your kindness, O God”</b> (Psalms 36:8). It is a precious and rare occurrence to perform an act of kindness properly. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a God-fearing</b> individual does not always encounter the opportunity to perform acts of kindness. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But the kindness of YHWH is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him”</b> (Psalms 103:17). |
| Psalms 36:9 | “They are abundantly satisfied with the plenty of Your house, and You feed them drink of the river of Your pleasures” | Sanhedrin 100a:14 | <b>R' Tanḥum ben Ḥanilai, says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who starves himself over matters of Torah in this world, God satisfies him in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: </b> “Your judgments are like the great deep” (Psalms 36:7), indicating that God is exacting with the righteous and does not reward them in this world, and it is stated thereafter: <b>“They are abundantly satisfied with the plenty of Your house, and You feed them drink of the river of Your pleasures”</b> (Psalms 36:9). |
| Psalms 36:10 | the treasuries of life, as it is written: “For with You is the source of life” | Chagigah 12b:12 | <b><i>Aravot</i>, </b> skies, is the firmament <b>that contains righteousness; justice; righteousness, </b> i.e., charity; <b>the treasuries of life; the treasuries of peace; the treasuries of blessing; the souls of the righteous; the spirits and souls that are to be created; and the dew that God will use to revive the dead. </b> The Talmud proves this statement: <b>Righteousness and justice</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>righteousness, as it is written: “And He donned righteousness as armor”</b> (Isaiah 59:17); <b>the treasuries of life, as it is written: “For with You is the source of life”</b> (Psalms 36:10). <b>And the treasuries of peace</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And he called Him YHWH of peace”</b> (Judges 6:24), implying that peace is God’s name and is therefore found close to Him. <b>And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from YHWH”</b> (Psalms 24:5). |
| Psalms 37:1 | written: “Do not compete with evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust” | Berakhot 7b:16 | <b>That</b> statement <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita,</i> as <b>R' Dostai ben Matun, says: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, </b> and the keepers of the Torah will fight them. ” <b>And if someone whispered to you, saying, </b> on the contrary, <b>isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “Do not compete with evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust”</b> (Psalms 37:1), meaning that one should avoid provoking the wicked, <b>say to him: </b> Only <b>one whose heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he committed <b>says this. Rather, </b> the true meaning of the verse is: <b>Do not compete with evil-doers, to be like the evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust to be like the unjust. </b> |
| Psalms 37:1 | do not provoke him, as it is stated: “Contend not with evildoers” | Megillah 6b:5 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak</b> also <b>said: If you see a wicked man whom the hour is smiling upon, </b> i.e., who is enjoying good fortune, <b>do not provoke him, as it is stated: “Contend not with evildoers”</b> (Psalms 37:1). <b>And not only that, but</b> if you provoke him, <b>his undertakings will be successful, as it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times”</b> (Psalms 10:5). <b>And not only that, but</b> even if he is brought to court, <b>he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far above him”</b> (Psalms 10:5), as though the trial is far removed from him and does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he will see his enemies</b> fall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his enemies, he hisses at them”</b> (Psalms 10:5). |
| Psalms 37:4 | it is stated: “And you shall delight in God and He will grant you your heart’s desires” | Shabbat 118b:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> One who delights in Shabbat <b>is rescued from the oppression of exile. </b> He derives it by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“And I will cause you to ride on the heights [<i>bamotei</i>] of the world”</b> (Isaiah 58:14), <b>and it is written there: </b> “You are fortunate Israel, who is like you? A nation redeemed by God, the shield that aids you and the sword of your triumph. Your enemies will try to defeat you <b>and you will trample their high places [<i>bamoteimo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who delights in the Shabbat, </b> God <b>grants him his heart’s desires, </b> as <b>it is stated: “And you shall delight in God and He will grant you your heart’s desires”</b> (Psalms 37:4). <b>This delight</b> in God, which is mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When it says: “And you shall call the Shabbat delight, ”</b> one <b>must say: It is the delight of Shabbat. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>With what does one delight</b> in the day of Shabbat? <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: With a dish of beets, and large fish, and heads of garlic. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi</b> said that <b>Rav said: Even</b> with regard to <b>a small item and one prepared it in deference to Shabbat, it is</b> a <b>delight. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the small item mentioned? <b>Rav Pappa said: Small fried fish. </b> |
| Psalms 37:7 | “Resign yourself to the Lord, and wait patiently [ hitḥolel ] for Him; | Gittin 7a:7 | Mar Ukva <b>sent</b> word to <b>him</b> again: <b>They are tormenting me a great deal and I cannot stand them. </b> R' Elazar <b>sent to him</b> in response: <b>“Resign yourself to YHWH, and wait patiently [<i>hitḥolel</i>] for Him; </b> do not fret yourself because of he who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass” (Psalms 37:7). This verse indicates: <b>“Resign yourself to YHWH, ”</b> i.e., do not do anything, <b>and He will strike them down as many corpses [<i>ḥalalim</i>]. Rise before and stay later than them</b> in your visits <b>to the study hall, and they will disappear on their own. </b> The Talmud relates: <b>The matter emerged from the mouth of R' Elazar, and Geneiva, </b> Mar Ukva’s tormentor, <b>was placed in a neck iron [<i>kolar</i>], </b> as one sentenced by the government. |
| Psalms 37:7 | states: “Resign yourself [ dom ] to the Lord, and wait patiently [ vehitḥolel ] for Him” | Zevachim 115b:14 | <b>And likewise in</b> a verse written by <b>David</b> it <b>states: “Resign yourself [<i>dom</i>] to YHWH, and wait patiently [<i>vehitḥolel</i>] for Him”</b> (Psalms 37:7). <b>Although He strikes down many corpses [<i>ḥalalim</i>]</b> around <b>you, you be silent</b> and do not complain. <b>And likewise in</b> a verse written by <b>Solomon</b> it <b>states: “A time to keep silence, and a time to speak”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:7).

| Psalms 37:8 | At that moment, Moses our teacher wanted to kill them, as it is stated: “Cease from anger [ af ] and forsake wrath [ ḥeima ]” | Nedarim 32a:4 | <b>At that moment, Moses our teacher wanted to kill them, as it is stated: “Cease from anger [<i>af</i> ] and forsake wrath [<i>ḥeima</i>]”</b> (Psalms 37:8), which indicates that he wanted to harm them. <b>And there are those who say: He killed</b> the angel named <b>Ḥeima, as it is stated: “Wrath is not in me”</b> (Isaiah 27:4). The Talmud asks: How is it possible to say that he killed Ḥeima? <b>Isn’t it written</b> that Moses himself said much later: <b>“For I was in dread of the anger and wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19)? The Talmud answers: <b>There are two</b> types of <b>wrath. And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the army of Ḥeima</b> remained but not the angel itself. |
| Psalms 37:11 | arrogance is equal to them all. However, with regard to the humble it is written: “The humble will inherit the land and delight themselves in the abundance of peace” | Sukkah 29b:2 | <b>Rav said: On account of four matters the property of homeowners is confiscated by the state treasury [<i>timyon</i>]: On</b> account of <b>those who delay</b> payment of <b>the salary of hired laborers</b> (see Leviticus 19:13; Deuteronomy 24:15); <b>on</b> account of <b>those who withhold the salary of hired laborers</b> and do not pay at all; <b>and on</b> account of <b>those who throw off the yoke</b> of communal responsibility <b>from their</b> own <b>necks and place</b> that yoke <b>on</b> the necks of <b>their friends; and on</b> account of <b>the arrogance</b> of those who, due to their wealth, exercise power over the community. <b>And the</b> punishment for <b>arrogance is equal to them all.

| Psalms 37:19 | would have been fulfilled for me: “They will not be shamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied” | Bava Metzia106a:13 | <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that if there is a regional disaster the cultivator subtracts from the produce he owes as part of his tenancy <b>only if</b> the tenant <b>planted</b> the field <b>and</b> it <b>sprouted and</b> then <b>grasshoppers consumed it, </b> or if he planted it with a different seed, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not plant it at all, </b> the tenant is <b>not</b> entitled to subtract from the amount he owes even if there was a regional disaster. This is <b>because</b> the owner can <b>say to him: Had you planted it, </b> perhaps my merit would have prevented the field from being affected by the epidemic, and the following verse <b>would have been fulfilled for me: “They will not be shamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 37:19). |
| Psalms 37:21 | “The wicked borrows, and pays not” | Bava Batra45a:2 | The Talmud answers: <b>Actually, </b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not have other land, </b> and the reason that he is nevertheless biased in his testimony is that he wants his creditors to be able to collect the debt <b>because he says</b> to himself that it is <b>uncomfortable for him to be</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21). |
| Psalms 37:21 | “The wicked borrows, and pays not” | Bava Batra45a:3 | The Talmud asks: But <b>ultimately, he is also</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21) <b>with regard to the other</b> one, to whom he sold the land. He took money from the buyer, who did not receive anything in exchange, as the land was seized from him. The Talmud answers: He is not concerned about his behavior toward the buyer, <b>as</b> he can <b>say</b> to him: <b>For this</b> very reason <b>I sold it to you without a guarantee, </b> so that if it would be seized from you I would not be liable. |
| Psalms 37:25 | “I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread” | Yevamot 16a:6 | R' Dosa ben Harkinas <b>recited this verse about</b> R' Elazar ben Azarya: <b>“I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”</b> (Psalms 37:25). He interpreted this verse to mean that the son of a Torah scholar also becomes a Torah scholar. <b>He grabbed him and sat him on a bed of gold. </b> R' Yehoshua <b>said to him: R', call your other disciple</b> so <b>that he may sit. He said to him: Who is that? </b> He said to him: <b>Akiva ben Yosef. </b> R' Dosa <b>said to him: You are Akiva ben Yosef, whose name has spread from one end of the world to the other? </b> Even R' Dosa had heard of R' Akiva’s reputation as a great man. <b>Sit, my son, sit.

| Psalms 37:25 | the world: “I have been young, and now am old; | Yevamot 16b:6 | § In relation to a verse cited earlier, <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: This verse was stated by the ministering angel</b> appointed over <b>the world: “I have been young, and now am old; </b> yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread” (Psalms 37:25). <b>Who said this? If we say</b> that it was <b>God is there old age before Him? </b> Could God possibly say: “I have been young, and now am old”? <b>And rather, </b> one could say that <b>David</b> himself <b>said it, </b> from his own experience; but <b>was he indeed so old? </b> After all, David died at the age of seventy. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that <b>the ministering angel</b> appointed over <b>the world said it, </b> as he can speak both of youth and old age, and it is he who reported his observations from around the world. |
| Psalms 37:31 | “The Torah of his God is in his heart” | Moed Katan21b:6 | <b>When they were about to take leave, R' Akiva stood on a large bench and said: Our brothers, the house of Israel, listen! Even had my two sons been bridegrooms, I would have been consoled on account of the honor you have shown</b> them. <b>If you came</b> to console <b>for the sake of Akiva, there are many Akivas in the marketplace</b> whom the Jews do all not come to console. <b>Rather, </b> certainly <b>this is what you said</b> to yourselves: <b>“The Torah of his God is in his heart”</b> (Psalms 37:31), and you wished to show your respect for the Torah. <b>All the more so is your reward doubled, </b> for you have consoled mourners and shown respect for the Torah. <b>Return</b> now <b>to your homes in peace. </b> This indicates that a mourner may greet other people even on the first day of his mourning. |
| Psalms 37:32 | And Rabbi Shimon ben Levi says: A person’s inclination overpowers him every day, and seeks to kill him, as it is stated: “The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him” | Kiddushin 30b:7 | <b>And R' Shimon ben Levi says: A person’s inclination overpowers him every day, and seeks to kill him, as it is stated: “The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him”</b> (Psalms 37:32). <b>And if not</b> for the fact that <b>God assists</b> each person in battling his evil inclination, <b>he could not</b> overcome <b>it, as it is stated: “YHWH will not leave him in his hand”</b> (Psalms 37:33). |

| Psalms 38:11 | Fear, as it is written: “My heart flutters, my strength fails me” | Gittin 70a:19 | § <b>Three things diminish a person’s strength, and they are: Fear, </b> traveling on the <b>road, and sin. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>Fear, as it is written: “My heart flutters, my strength fails me”</b> (Psalms 38:11). Traveling on the <b>road, as it is written: “He has weakened my strength on the road”</b> (Psalms 102:24). <b>Sin, as it is written: “My strength fails because of my sin”</b> (Psalms 31:11). |
| Psalms 38:14 | hears but does not speak is a mute? As it is written: “But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man [ illem ] who does not open his mouth” | Chagigah 2b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one who speaks but does not hear is a deaf</b> person, and one who <b>hears but does not speak is a mute? As it is written: “But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man [<i>illem</i>] who does not open his mouth”</b> (Psalms 38:14). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that this is <b>as people say: His speech has been taken [<i>Ishtakeil Milulei</i>]; </b> the term <i>illem</i> is an acronym for this phrase. |
| Psalms 38:14 | a mute person? As it is written: “And I am like a deaf man, I do not hear, and like the mute man who will not open his mouth” | Gittin 71a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where</b> do we learn <b>that</b> one <b>who speaks but cannot hear, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a deaf person, </b> and that with regard to one <b>who hears but cannot speak, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a mute person? As it is written: “And I am like a deaf man, I do not hear, and like the mute man who will not open his mouth”</b> (Psalms 38:14). <b>And if you wish, say as people say: </b> The word for a mute [<i>ilem</i>] is a contraction of the expression <b>his speech has been taken [<i>ishtakil millulei</i>]. </b> |
| Psalms 38:18 | which is written: “For I am ready to stumble [ letzela ] and my pain is always before me” | Sanhedrin 107a:9 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For I am ready to stumble [<i>letzela</i>] and my pain is always before me”</b> (Psalms 38:18)? <b>Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, was</b> designated as <b>fit for David from the six days of Creation. </b> Rava interprets that the term <i>letzela</i> is referring to Eve, who was taken from the side [<i>tzela</i>] of Adam, the first man, and explains that she was destined for him, just as Eve was destined for Adam. <b>But she came to him through pain. And likewise, the school of R' Yishmael taught: Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, was</b> designated as <b>fit for David, but he partook of her unripe, </b> before the appointed time. David would have ultimately married her in a permitted manner after the death of Uriah. |
| Psalms 39:2 | “I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me” | Gittin 7a:6 | R' Elazar <b>scored</b> parchment <b>and wrote to him</b> the following verse: <b>“I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me”</b> (Psalms 39:2). R' Elazar quoted this verse to allude to the following response: <b>Even though “the wicked is before me, ” “I will keep a curb upon my mouth. ”</b> |
| Psalms 39:3 | and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren, </b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of YHWH your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am YHWH your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather, </b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>God, </b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions, </b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong. ” |
| Psalms 39:13 | as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears” | Bava Metzia59a:5 | <b>R' Elazar says: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked, </b> and prayer is not accepted as it once was, <b>as it is stated</b> in lament of the Temple’s destruction: <b>“Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer”</b> (Lamentations 3:8). Yet, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that the gates of prayer were locked</b> with the destruction of the Temple, <b>the gates of tears were not locked, </b> and one who cries before God may rest assured that his prayers will be answered, <b>as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears”</b> (Psalms 39:13). |
| Psalms 39:13 | as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears” | Berakhot 32b:5 | On the subject of prayer, <b>R' Elazar also said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked</b> and prayer is not accepted as it once was, <b>as it is said</b> in lamentation of the Temple’s destruction: <b>“Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer”</b> (Lamentations 3:8). Yet, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that the gates of prayer were locked</b> with the destruction of the Temple, <b>the gates of tears were not locked, </b> and one who cries before God may rest assured that his prayers will be answered, <b>as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears”</b> (Psalms 39:13). Since this prayer is a request that God should pay heed to the tears of one who is praying, he is certain that at least the gates of tears are not locked. |
| Psalms 40:3 | And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven, as it is written: “He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit [ bor shaon ], out of the miry clay [ tit hayaven ]” | Eruvin 19a:17 | <b>She’ol, as it is written: “Out of the belly of the netherworld [<i>she’ol</i>] I cried and You did hear my voice”</b> (Jonah 2:3). <b>Avadon, as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [<i>avadon</i>]? ”</b> (Psalms 88:12). <b>Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [<i>shaḥat</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:10). <b>And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven, as it is written: “He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit [<i>bor shaon</i>], out of the miry clay [<i>tit hayaven</i>]”</b> (Psalms 40:3). <b>And Tzalmavet, as it is written: “Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death [<i>tzalmavet</i>], </b> bound in affliction and iron” (Psalms 107:10). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Taḥtit, </b> i.e., the underworld, <b>it is</b> known by <b>tradition</b> that this is its name. |
| Psalms 40:6 | which is written: “Many things have You done, O Lord my God, Your wonders and Your thoughts are upon us” | Yevamot 77a:6 | <b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Many things have You done, O Lord my God, Your wonders and Your thoughts are upon us”</b> (Psalms 40:6)? <b>Upon me is not stated, but</b> rather <b>“upon us, ”</b> which <b>teaches that Rehoboam, </b> son of Solomon and grandson of David, was <b>sitting on the lap of David, </b> who <b>said to him: These two verses were stated about me and about you, </b> as Rehoboam’s mother was Na’ama the Ammonite. |
| Psalms 40:8 | scroll by scroll, as it is stated: “Then I said, behold, I come with the scroll of the book that is written for me” | Gittin 60a:14 | The Talmud returns to discuss the previously mentioned dispute. <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Bana’a: The Torah was given</b> from the outset <b>scroll by scroll, as it is stated: “Then I said, behold, I come with the scroll of the book that is written for me”</b> (Psalms 40:8). King David is saying about himself that there is a section of the Torah, “the scroll of the book,” that alludes to him, i.e., “that is written for me. ” This indicates that each portion of the Torah constitutes a separate scroll. <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: The Torah was given</b> as <b>a complete</b> book, <b>as it is stated: “Take this scroll of the Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), which teaches that from the outset the Torah was given as a complete unit. |
| Psalms 40:8 | which is written: “Then I said: Behold, I have come; in the scroll of a book it is written about me” | Yevamot 77a:7 | With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Then I said: Behold, I have come; in the scroll of a book it is written about me”</b> (Psalms 40:8)? <b>David said: I</b> had <b>said</b> that <b>I have come</b> only <b>now; </b> my life was created only recently, at the time of my birth. <b>But I did not know that it was</b> already <b>written about me in the scroll of a book, </b> that an ancient text already hints at my existence. <b>There, </b> with regard to the daughters of Lot, <b>it is written: </b> “And your two daughters <b>that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15), and <b>here, </b> with regard to David, <b>it is written: “I have found David, My servant; I have anointed him with My holy oil”</b> (Psalms 89:21). The lost article that was found among the daughters of Lot, the mothers of Ammon and Moab, is David and his royal house. |
| Psalms 40:10 | it is written: “I have preached righteousness in the great congregation” | Eruvin 63a:22 | <b>Rav Hamnuna raised a contradiction</b> between the verse previously mentioned and another verse: <b>It is written: “Your word have I hidden in my heart, ”</b> implying that David did not want to reveal the words of Torah, whereas in a second verse <b>it is written: “I have preached righteousness in the great congregation”</b> (Psalms 40:10). He answered: This is <b>not difficult. Here, </b> in the verse in which David remained silent, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri, </b> David’s teacher, <b>was alive; there, </b> in the verse where he publicized his words, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri was no</b> longer <b>alive. </b> |
| Psalms 41:2 | Rav said: Anyone who visits the ill is spared from the judgment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is he that considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the day of evil” | Nedarim 40a:4 | <b>Rav said: Anyone who visits the ill is spared from the judgment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is he that considers the poor; YHWH will deliver him in the day of evil”</b> (Psalms 41:2). In this verse, the term <b>poor [<i>dal</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>ill, as it is stated</b> in the prayer of Hezekiah when he was ill: <b>“He will cut me off from the illness [<i>middalla</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 38:12). <b>Alternatively, </b> it may be derived <b>from this verse</b> in which Jonadab asked his sick friend Amnon, son of King David: “<b>Why, son of the king, are you so sick [<i>dal</i>] from morning to morning? ”</b> (II Samuel 13:4). <b>And</b> the term <b>evil means nothing other</b> than <b>Gehenna, as it is stated: “YHWH made everything for His own purpose, and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), and the ultimate punishment of the evildoer is Gehenna. |
| Psalms 41:3 | “The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not You him unto the greed of his enemies” | Nedarim 40a:6 | Rav continues: His reward is as it is written: <b>“YHWH will preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not You him unto the greed of his enemies”</b> (Psalms 41:3). He elaborates: <b>“YHWH will preserve him” from the evil inclination; “and keep him alive”</b> and spare him <b>from suffering; “let him be called happy in the land”</b> means that <b>everyone will be honored</b> from their association <b>with him; “and deliver not You him unto the greed of his enemies, ”</b> so <b>that companions like</b> those who counseled <b>Naaman</b> to seek <b>a cure for his tzara'at</b> from Elisha (II Kings 5:3) <b>will happen to</b> associate with <b>him, </b> and <b>companions like</b> those who counseled <b>Rehoboam</b> with advice that resulted in <b>the schism in his kingdom</b> (I Kings 12:6–19) <b>will not happen to</b> associate with <b>him. </b> |
| Psalms 41:4 | as it is stated: “The Lord will support him upon the bed of suffering” | Nedarim 40a:9 | § <b>Ravin said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God</b> Himself <b>sustains the sick person? </b> It is <b>as it is stated: “YHWH will support him upon the bed of suffering”</b> (Psalms 41:4). Support in this context is understood to mean that He will feed him. <b>And Ravin said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Shekhina is resting above the bed of the sick person? </b> It is also <b>as it is stated: “YHWH will support him upon the bed of suffering, ”</b> which indicates that God is actually over his bed. |
| Psalms 41:4 | You overturned all his lying down in his illness” | Nedarim 41a:3 | § <b>R' Alexandri said</b> that <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The sick person recovers from his illness only when</b> the heavenly court <b>forgives him for all his sins, as it is stated: “Who forgives all your iniquity; Who heals all your diseases”</b> (Psalms 103:3). <b>Rav Hamnuna said: </b> When he recovers, <b>he returns to the days of his youth, as it is stated</b> in a verse with regard to one recovering from illness: <b>“His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth”</b> (Job 33:25). Interpreting the verse: “YHWH will support him upon the bed of suffering; <b>You overturned all his lying down in his illness”</b> (Psalms 41:4), <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> That is <b>to say that</b> the sick person <b>forgets his studies, </b> as everything that is organized is overturned. |
| Psalms 41:4 | the sick person? As it is stated: “God will support him on the bed of illness” | Shabbat 12b:3 | <b>As Rav Anan said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where is it derived that the Shekhina cares for</b> and aids <b>the sick person? As it is stated: “God will support him on the bed of illness”</b> (Psalms 41:4). The Talmud comments: <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters to visit the sick person should sit neither on the bed nor on a chair; rather, he should wrap himself</b> in his prayer shawl with trepidation and awe, <b>and sit before</b> the sick person below him, <b>as the Shekhina is above the head of the sick person, as it is stated: “God will support him on the bed of illness, ”</b> and he must treat the Shekhina with deference. On a similar note, <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Ravin said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God feeds the sick person</b> during his illness? <b>As it is stated: “God will support him on the bed of illness. ”</b> |
| Psalms 41:6 | They said to him: Yes, Mattai shall be executed, as it is written: “When [ matai ] shall he die, and his name perish?” | Sanhedrin 43a:22 | Apropos the trial of Jesus, the Talmud cites another <i>baraita</i>, where <b>A baraita states: Jesus the Nazarene had five disciples: Mattai, Nakai, Netzer, Buni, and Toda. They brought Mattai in</b> to stand trial. Mattai <b>said to</b> the judges: <b>Shall Mattai be executed? </b> But <b>isn’t it written: “When [<i>matai</i>] shall I come and appear before God? ”</b> (Psalms 42:3). Mattai claimed that this verse alludes to the fact he is righteous. <b>They said to him: Yes, Mattai shall be executed, as it is written: “When [<i>matai</i>] shall he die, and his name perish? ”</b> (Psalms 41:6). |
| Psalms 41:10 | who did eat of my bread, has lifted his heel against me” | Sanhedrin 107a:1 | <b>who did eat of my bread, has lifted his heel against me”</b> (Psalms 41:10). Bread is a metaphor for Torah knowledge. |
| Psalms 41:10 | “Indeed, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, | Sanhedrin 7a:13 | There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was saying as he walked: The man upon whom I relied</b> has <b>lifted his fist [<i>ligzizeih</i>] and stood</b> against me. <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: A verse</b> is <b>written</b> that conveys the message of this aphorism: <b>“Indeed, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, </b> who did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me” (Psalms 41:10). |
| Psalms 42:3 | isn’t it written: “When [ matai ] shall I come and appear before God?” | Sanhedrin 43a:22 | Apropos the trial of Jesus, the Talmud cites another <i>baraita</i>, where <b>A baraita states: Jesus the Nazarene had five disciples: Mattai, Nakai, Netzer, Buni, and Toda.

| Psalms 42:8 | As it is stated: “Deep calls to deep at the sound of your channels, | Taanit 25b:8 | <b>R' Elazar said: When the water</b> libation <b>was poured during the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, these waters of the <b>deep say to the other</b> waters of the deep: <b>Let your water flow, as I hear the voices of two</b> of our <b>friends, </b> the wine libation and the water libation, which are both poured on the altar. <b>As it is stated: “Deep calls to deep at the sound of your channels, </b> all Your waves and Your billows are gone over me” (Psalms 42:8), i.e., the upper waters of the deep call to the lower waters of the deep when they hear the sound of the libations. |
| Psalms 42:9 | creatures, as it is stated: “By day the Lord will command His loving-kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me” | Avodah Zarah3b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>And during</b> the twelve hours of <b>the night, what does</b> God <b>do? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the night is <b>similar to the day, </b> i.e., God performs the same activities as in the day. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that He <b>rides on his light cherub and flies in eighteen thousand worlds, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even [<i>shinan</i>] thousands”</b> (Psalms 68:18). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>even [<i>shinan</i>], rather</b> read it as: <b>That which are not [<i>she’einan</i>]. </b> Since the minimum of thousands is two thousand, the phrase: That which are not thousands, indicates that two thousand are not present, i.e., the chariots of God are twenty thousand minus two thousand, which means that God rides in eighteen thousand worlds. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that God <b>sits and listens to the songs from the mouths of the</b> angelic <b>creatures, as it is stated: “By day YHWH will command His loving-kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me”</b> (Psalms 42:9). |
| Psalms 42:9 | with Torah at night, the Holy One, Blessed be He, extends a thread of kindness over him by day, as it is stated: “By day, the Lord will command His kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me” | Avodah Zarah3b:14 | § <b>R' Levi says: Anyone who interrupts</b> his study <b>of words of Torah to occupy</b> himself <b>with mundane matters</b> will be <b>fed with the coals of the broom tree, as it is stated: “They pluck salt-wort from wormwood, and the roots of the broom are their food”</b> (Job 30:4). <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who occupies</b> himself <b>with Torah at night, God extends a thread of kindness over him by day, as it is stated: “By day, YHWH will command His kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me”</b> (Psalms 42:9). The verse is understood as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>by day, YHWH will command His kindness</b> to extend over him? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that in the night His song is with me, </b> i.e., he occupies himself at night with Torah, which is referred to as a song. |
| Psalms 42:9 | as it is stated: “By day the Lord will command His kindness, and in the night His song is with me” | Chagigah 12b:7 | <b><i>Ma’on</i>, </b> habitation, <b>is where</b> there are <b>groups of ministering angels who recite song at night and are silent during the day out of respect for Israel, </b> in order not to compete with their songs, <b>as it is stated: “By day YHWH will command His kindness, and in the night His song is with me”</b> (Psalms 42:9), indicating that the song of the angels is with God only at night. |
| Psalms 44:2 | “O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work You did in their days, in days of old” | Taanit 24b:9 | <b>He said before</b> God: <b>God!, </b> it is written: <b>“O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work You did in their days, in days of old”</b> (Psalms 44:2), <b>but we have not seen it with our</b> own <b>eyes. </b> As soon as he said this, <b>rain came until the gutters of Meḥoza</b> overflowed and <b>poured into the Tigris</b> River. Rava’s <b>father came</b> and <b>appeared to him in a dream and said to him: Is there</b> anyone <b>who troubles Heaven so much</b> to ask for rain out of its season? In his dream, his father further <b>said to him: Change your place</b> of rest at night. <b>He changed his place, and the next day he found that his bed had been slashed by knives. </b> |
| Psalms 44:13 | states: “You sell Your people without wealth, and have not set their prices high” | Temurah 30a:9 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the definition of the price of a dog, <b>A baraita states: “The price of a dog”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:19), <b>this is</b> referring to an animal given in <b>exchange for a dog. </b> In this context the word “price” means an item given in exchange for another item, not money. <b>And likewise</b> the verse <b>states: “You sell Your people without wealth, and have not set their prices high”</b> (Psalms 44:13). The phrase “without wealth” indicates that the term “their prices” means an item given in exchange, rather than money. |
| Psalms 44:23 | the verse states: “As For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter” | Gittin 57b:13 | <b>When the girls heard this, they all leapt and fell into the sea. The boys</b> then <b>drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves and said: If these</b> girls, <b>for whom</b> sex with men <b>is their natural way, </b> act in <b>such</b> a manner, then <b>we, for whom</b> sex with men <b>is not our natural way, </b> should <b>all the more so</b> conduct ourselves likewise. <b>They too leapt into the sea. Concerning them</b> and others like them <b>the verse states: “As For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter”</b> (Psalms 44:23). |
| Psalms 44:23 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says | Gittin 57b:21 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> concerning the verse: “For Your sake we are killed all the day long” (Psalms 44:23), that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision, which was given for the 8th</b> day, as the blood of our newborn sons is spilled for the sake of the covenant with God. <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: </b> This verse was stated in reference to <b>Torah scholars who demonstrate the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter on themselves, </b> meaning that they demonstrate on their own bodies how ritual slaughter should be performed and occasionally injure themselves in the process. This is <b>as Rava says: A person may demonstrate anything using himself</b> to illustrate the act <b>except for slaughter and another matter, </b> a euphemism for sex. |
| Psalms 44:24 | say: “Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord?” | Sotah 48a:7 | § The Mishnah further taught: <b>He also nullified</b> the actions of <b>the awakeners. </b> The Talmud poses a question: <b>What</b> are <b>awakeners? Raḥava says: On each and every day when the Levites stood on the platform</b> in the Temple <b>they</b> would <b>say: “Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? ”</b> (Psalms 44:24). Therefore, they were called awakeners. Yoḥanan the High Priest <b>said to them: Does God sleep, </b> that you call upon Him to awaken? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “Behold, He that keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”</b> (Psalms 121:4)? <b>Rather, when the Jewish people are in a state of suffering, and the nations of the world are in</b> a state of <b>calm and serenity, </b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>it is stated: “Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? ”</b> If the verse were to be recited every morning it would be interpreted in the wrong way, so Yoḥanan the High Priest therefore canceled the daily recitation of this verse. |
| Psalms 45:2 | musings [ raḥashei ] of the heart, as it is written: “My heart muses [ raḥash ] on a goodly matter” | Menachot 63a:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud inquires: As the Torah does not describe the different vessels, <b>what is the reason for</b> the interpretation of <b>R' Yosei</b> HaGelili, explaining that a <i>marḥeshet</i> has a cover and a <i>maḥavat</i> does not have a cover? <b>If we say</b> that the term <b><i>marḥeshet</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> the sinful <b>musings [<i>raḥashei</i>] of the heart, as it is written: “My heart muses [<i>raḥash</i>] on a goodly matter”</b> (Psalms 45:2), and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in a covered vessel just as the thoughts of the heart are hidden, this interpretation is insufficient. <b>And</b> if we say that the term <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> transgressions committed with the <b>corners of [<i>ammaḥavo’ei</i>] the mouth, as people say</b> with regard to someone who speaks loudly: He <b>is barking [<i>minbaḥ nevuḥei</i>], </b> and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in an open vessel, this interpretation is also insufficient. |
| Psalms 45:4 | are ornaments for him? As it is written: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, mighty one, your glory and your splendor” | Shabbat 63a:13 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi, and some say</b> it was <b>to Rav Avya, and some say Rav Yosef said to Rav Dimi, and some say</b> it was <b>to Rav Avya, and some say Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer who said: These</b> weapons <b>are ornaments for him? As it is written: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, mighty one, your glory and your splendor”</b> (Psalms 45:4), indicating that a sword is considered an ornament. |
| Psalms 45:5 | “And in your majesty prosper, ride on, on behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness” | Menachot 88b:8 | In praise for resolving his difficulty, R' Zerika <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> R' Yirmeya: <b>“And in your majesty prosper, ride on, on behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness”</b> (Psalms 45:5). |
| Psalms 45:5 | success for them, as it is written: “And in your majesty [ vahadarkha ] prosper, | Shabbat 63a:17 | <b>R' Yirmeya said</b> that <b>R' Elazar said: Two Torah scholars who sharpen one another in <i>halakha</i>; God, </b> ensures <b>success for them, as it is written: “And in your majesty [<i>vahadarkha</i>] prosper, </b> ride on, in behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; and let your right hand teach you tremendous things” (Psalms 45:5). The rabbis said: <b><b>Do not read “and your majesty [<i>vahadarkha</i>], ” rather, </b> by changing some of the vocalization and the letters, read it as <b>and He will sharpen you [<i>veḥidedkha</i>], </b> and ultimately you will be successful. <b><b>Moreover, they</b> who act in that manner will <b>rise to prominence, as it is written: “Prosper, ride on. ”</b> <br><b>I might have thought even</b> if one engages in the study of Torah <b>not for its own sake; </b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “On behalf of truth. ”</b> <br><b>I might have thought</b> that one would be rewarded with prosperity even <b>if he became arrogant; </b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Meekness</b> and <b>righteousness. ”</b> <br><b>And if they do so</b> in the proper manner <b>they merit the Torah that was given with the right hand</b> of God, <b>as it is written: “And let your right hand teach you tremendous things”</b> (Psalms 45:5). |
| Psalms 45:6 | And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you” | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister, </b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Psalms 45:10 | to him from this verse: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir” | Avodah Zarah65a:5 | <b>Rav Pappi said: </b> Rava <b>should have said</b> a response <b>to him from this verse: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir”</b> (Psalms 45:10), indicating that in the World-to-Come, the daughters of kings will serve the Jewish people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: He should have said</b> a response <b>to him from here: </b> The reward of the Jewish people will be such that <b>“no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). |
| Psalms 45:10 | which is written: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; upon your right hand stands a consort [ shegal ] in gold of Ophir” | Rosh Hashanah4a:8 | The Talmud raises another difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, </b> there is a contradiction from that <b>which is written: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; upon your right hand stands a consort [<i>shegal</i>] in gold of Ophir”</b> (Psalms 45:10). <b>Now, if <i>shegal</i> is a she-dog, what is the prophet heralding for the Jewish people? </b> The Talmud explains: <b>This is what</b> the prophet <b>is saying: In reward for the Torah being as precious to the Jews as a she-dog is to non-Jews, you merited the gold of Ophir. </b> |
| Psalms 45:11 | from here: “Listen, daughter and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people and your father’s house” | Chagigah 15b:8 | <b>Rav Ḥanina said</b> that one can find support for this idea <b>from here: “Listen, daughter and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people and your father’s house”</b> (Psalms 45:11), which likewise indicates that one must listen to the words of a Sage while forgetting, i.e., ignoring, the faulty aspects of his teachings. |
| Psalms 45:14 | “All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace” | Gittin 12a:16 | The Talmud asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where her earnings <b>suffice, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who was exiled to a city of refuge? The same <i>halakha</i> applies to all wives. The Talmud answers: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that in light of the verse: <b>“All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace”</b> (Psalms 45:14), from which it is derived that it is improper for a wife to spend too much time outside her home, this woman’s husband should be concerned that while his wife is in a city of refuge she should not work out of the home, but only in the home. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no need to be concerned about this matter, and her husband may say to her: Spend your earnings to sustain yourself, even in a city of refuge. |
| Psalms 45:14 | “All the glory of the king’s daughter is within” | Shevuot 30a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: And <b>if it is your wish to say? </b> Why is the initial proof inadequate? The Talmud answers that it means: <b>And if you would say</b> that with regard to <b>a woman, it is not</b> typical <b>conduct</b> for <b>her</b> to appear in court <b>due to</b> the verse that is stated with regard to women: <b>“All the glory of the king’s daughter is within”</b> (Psalms 45:14), and that is why the verse addressed a situation that is prevalent, i.e., a case where the litigants are men, and there is no proof that women are unfit for testimony. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> cites an additional proof. <b>It is stated here: </b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there: </b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there, </b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here, </b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks. |
| Psalms 45:14 | “The king’s daughter is all glorious within” | Yevamot 77a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>In any case, </b> the unanswered question raised by Doeg is <b>difficult. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Here, </b> in Babylonia, <b>they explained</b> the matter based on the verse: <b>“The king’s daughter is all glorious within”</b> (Psalms 45:14), which indicates that it is unbefitting for a woman to venture outside at all, and therefore the Ammonite women would not have been expected to go forth to meet the Jewish women. <b>In the West, </b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Yitzḥak</b> who said: <b>The verse states: “And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife? </b> And he said: Behold, in the tent” (Genesis 18:9), which teaches that it is praiseworthy for a woman to remain inside her home. |
| Psalms 45:17 | a difficulty for you: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” | Bava Batra159a:11 | <b>Rather, </b> the difficulty is <b>actually as we said initially, </b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that if a son sold some of his father’s property and then died, the son’s son repossesses the property from the buyers. <b>And</b> with regard to the verse <b>that</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17), which apparently indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, this is not difficult. <b>That</b> verse <b>is written as a blessing. </b> The verse does not indicate the halakhic status of the grandson’s inheritance, and the reason he can repossess the property is still difficult. |
| Psalms 45:17 | as it is written: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them into princes throughout the land” | Bava Batra159a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, as I inherit directly from him. <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as it is written: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them into princes throughout the land”</b> (Psalms 45:17). The phrase “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, and he does not inherit through his father. |
| Psalms 45:17 | as it is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons” | Bava Batra65a:5 | The Talmud comments: Nevertheless, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this disagreement in both cases, as the <i>halakha</i> in the one case cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> in the other. <b>As had we been taught</b> this dispute only <b>in that</b> case, of the brothers who divided their father’s estate, I would have said that only <b>in that</b> case <b>does Rav say</b> that they retain all of the earlier privileges, <b>because</b> one brother can <b>say to</b> the other: <b>I wish to live in</b> this house <b>just as my ancestors, </b> who had all of those privileges, <b>lived in it. Know</b> that there is substance to this claim, <b>as it is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17). <b>But in this</b> case of an ordinary house sale, <b>say that he concedes to Shmuel</b> that a seller sells generously. |
| Psalms 45:17 | which is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons” | Horayot 6a:5 | <b>Rav Pappa said: When</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that the fate of <b>a sin-offering whose owners have died</b> is to allow the animal <b>to die</b> without its being sacrificed, <b>this matter</b> applies specifically <b>with regard to an individual</b> who died <b>but not with regard to a congregation, because there is no death with regard to a congregation; </b> the entity of the congregation remains even when specific members die. The Talmud asks: <b>From where does Rav Pappa derive this? If we say</b> that he derives it <b>from</b> that <b>which is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17), indicating that as long as the sons are alive it is as though the fathers are alive, then <b>if so, </b> the same should be true <b>even with regard to an individual as well, </b> and sons should be able to sacrifice the sin-offerings of their dead fathers. |
| Psalms 45:17 | because it is written: “Your sons shall be instead of your fathers” | Temurah 15b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where does Rav Pappa derive this</b> statement? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “Your sons shall be instead of your fathers”</b> (Psalms 45:17), i.e., it is considered as though the fathers are alive, <b>if so, </b> then this should apply <b>even</b> to <b>an individual as well. </b> In other words, sons should be able to sacrifice the sin offerings of their late fathers. |
| Psalms 46:3 | fly over the surface of the water, as it is stated: “Therefore, we will not fear when God changes the land, and when the mountains are moved in the midst of the sea” | Sanhedrin 92b:1 | <b>And if you say: </b> During <b>those years when God is destined to renew His world, as it is stated: “And YHWH alone shall be exalted on that day”</b> (Isaiah 2:11), <b>what are the righteous</b> to <b>do? </b> How will they survive? <b>God, </b> will <b>make wings like eagles for them and</b> they will <b>fly over the surface of the water, as it is stated: “Therefore, we will not fear when God changes the land, and when the mountains are moved in the midst of the sea”</b> (Psalms 46:3). Although God will renew the land, they will not fear, because they will be in the sky over the sea at that time. <b>And lest you say</b> that they will endure <b>suffering</b> from flying uninterrupted for an extended period, <b>the verse states: “But they who wait for YHWH shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not tire”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). |
| Psalms 46:9 | the verse says: “Go, see the works of the Lord, who has made desolations [ shamot ] upon the earth” | Berakhot 7b:10 | Regarding the basic assumption that these homiletic interpretations of names are allusions to one’s future, the Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that the name affects</b> one’s life? <b>R' Eliezer said</b> that <b>the verse says: “Go, see the works of YHWH, who has made desolations [<i>shamot</i>] upon the earth”</b> (Psalms 46:9). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shamot</i>, rather</b> as <b><i>shemot</i>, names. </b> The names given to people are, therefore, “the works of YHWH upon the earth. ” |
| Psalms 47:4 | states: “He subdues [ yadber ] peoples under us” | Makkot 11a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that all</b> instances of <b>speaking [<i>dibbur</i>]</b> indicate <b>harsh language? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers: <b>“The man, YHWH of the land, spoke [<i>dibber</i>] harshly to us”</b> (Genesis 42:30). The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Then <b>they</b> who feared YHWH <b>spoke [<i>nidberu</i>]</b> with one another” (Malachi 3:16), that the term <b>“they spoke” is nothing other than a term of gentleness, and likewise, </b> the same is true of the verse which <b>states: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] peoples under us”</b> (Psalms 47:4), meaning that God will calmly and gently conduct the nations under the influence of the Jewish people? The Talmud answers: The meaning of <b><i>dibber</i> is discrete</b> and the meaning of <b><i>yadber</i> is discrete. </b> There is a difference between the two conjugations of the same root. |
| Psalms 47:4 | means nothing other than calm, as it is stated: “He subdues [ yadber ] people under us” | Shabbat 63a:19 | <b>R' Yirmeya said</b> that <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish said: Two Torah scholars who are agreeable to each other</b> when engaging <b>in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i>, God listens to them, as it is stated: “Then they that feared YHWH spoke [<i>nidberu</i>]</b> one with another; and YHWH hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear YHWH, and that think upon His name” (Malachi 3:16). <b>And</b> the term <b>speech</b> [<b><i>dibbur</i></b>] <b>means nothing other than calm, as it is stated: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] people under us”</b> (Psalms 47:4). He will cause the nations to submit to the Jewish people leading to a period of calm. Here too the term <i>dibbur</i> indicates calm and agreeability. |
| Psalms 47:9 | “God reigns over the nations, God sits upon His sacred throne” | Rosh Hashanah32b:9 | Similarly, the Talmud discusses the following verses: <b>“Sing praises to God, sing praises, sing praises to our King, sing praises. For God is the King of all the earth; </b> sing praises in a skillful song” (Psalms 47:7–8). These are counted as <b>two</b> verses of Kingship; this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei. R' Yehuda says: </b> They count as only <b>one</b> verse of Kingship, as the phrase: “Sing praises to our King,” is referring to God as the King of the Jewish people, not the King of the entire world. <b>And they</b> both <b>agree</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“God reigns over the nations, God sits upon His sacred throne”</b> (Psalms 47:9), <b>that it is</b> considered as only <b>one</b> verse of Kingship, as the phrase: “Sits upon His sacred throne,” is not referring to God explicitly as King. |
| Psalms 47:10 | the daughter of Abraham our father who is called a prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham” | Chagigah 3a:13 | With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “How beautiful are your feet in sandals, daughter of the prince [<i>nadiv</i>]”? How pleasant are the feet [<i>raglehen</i>] of the Jewish people when they ascend to</b> Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival [<i>regel</i>]. “Daughter of the prince”: </b> this is referring to <b>the daughter of Abraham our father who is called a prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham”</b> (Psalms 47:10). The Talmud asks: Is God only <b>“the God of Abraham, ” and not the God of Isaac and Jacob? Rather, </b> the verse mentions <b>“the God of Abraham, ” as</b> he <b>was the first of the converts. </b> Abraham was the first prince, as all converts who follow in his path are called “the princes of the peoples. ” |
| Psalms 47:10 | the daughter of Abraham our Patriarch, who was called prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered, the people of the God of Abraham” | Sukkah 49b:6 | § Apropos the homiletic interpretations of the verses from Song of Songs with regard to the drainpipes, the Talmud cites additional interpretations. <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “How beautiful are your steps in sandals, O prince’s daughter”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2)? <b>How beautiful are the feet of the Jewish people at the time when they ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the Festival. “O prince’s daughter”; </b> this is referring to <b>the daughter of Abraham our Patriarch, who was called prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered, the people of the God of Abraham”</b> (Psalms 47:10). The verse calls the Jewish people the people of <b>the God of Abraham and not the God of Isaac and Jacob. </b> Why are the Jewish people associated specifically with Abraham? <b>Rather</b> than referring to the three Patriarchs, the verse is referring to <b>the God of Abraham, who was first of the converts, </b> and therefore it is reasonable for the princes of other nations to gather around him. |
| Psalms 48:2 | “Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised | Rosh Hashanah31a:3 | <b>On the second</b> day of the week <b>what</b> psalm <b>would</b> the Levites <b>recite? </b> The psalm that begins: <b>“Great is YHWH, and highly to be praised</b> in the city of our God, His sacred mountain” (Psalms 48:2). This is <b>because</b> on the second day of Creation <b>He separated His works, </b> dividing between the upper waters and the lower waters, <b>and ruled over them</b> as King; and this psalm speaks of Jerusalem as “The city of a great King” (Psalms 48:3). |
| Psalms 48:3 | “Beautiful view [ nof ], the joy of the whole earth, | Rosh Hashanah26a:20 | <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish said: When I went to the district of Kan Nishrayya, </b> I heard that <b>they called a bride <i>ninfi</i> and a rooster <i>sekhvi</i>. </b> The Talmud explains how this information serves to clarify the meanings of biblical verses: <b>A bride</b> is called <b><i>ninfi</i>; what is the verse</b> that uses a similar term? <b>“Beautiful view [<i>nof</i>], the joy of the whole earth, </b> Mount Zion” (Psalms 48:3), which therefore means beautiful like a bride. <b>And a rooster</b> is called <b><i>sekhvi</i>; Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: And if you wish, </b> you can <b>say</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said this: <b>What is the verse</b> that employs this term? <b>“Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the <i>sekhvi</i>”</b> (Job 38:36), which should be understood as follows: <b>“Who has put wisdom in the inward parts”: These are the kidneys</b> that are hidden in the body; <b>“or who has given understanding to the <i>sekhvi</i>”: This is a rooster, </b> who knows to crow at fixed times during the night. |
| Psalms 48:3 | and ruled over them | Rosh Hashanah31a:3 | <b>On the second</b> day of the week <b>what</b> psalm <b>would</b> the Levites <b>recite? </b> The psalm that begins: <b>“Great is YHWH, and highly to be praised</b> in the city of our God, His sacred mountain” (Psalms 48:2). This is <b>because</b> on the second day of Creation <b>He separated His works, </b> dividing between the upper waters and the lower waters, <b>and ruled over them</b> as King; and this psalm speaks of Jerusalem as “The city of a great King” (Psalms 48:3). |
| Psalms 48:9 | Selah, as it is written: “As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it forever, Selah” | Eruvin 54a:15 | <b>Selah, as it is written: “As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of YHWH of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it forever, Selah”</b> (Psalms 48:9), which demonstrates that Selah means forever. <b><i>Va’ed</i>, as it is written: “YHWH shall reign forever and ever [<i>va’ed</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:18). |
| Psalms 49:2 | “Listen all you inhabitants of the world [ ḥeled ]” | Chullin 127a:12 | §The Talmud continues to discuss creatures living in a particular environment. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kilayim</i> 5:10): For <b>every</b> animal <b>that exists on land there is</b> an equivalent animal <b>in the sea, except for the weasel, </b> which exists only on land. <b>R' Zeira said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? It is written: <b>“Listen all you inhabitants of the world [<i>ḥeled</i>]”</b> (Psalms 49:2). Dry land is called <i>ḥeled</i> because it is the sole habitat for the weasel [<i>ḥulda</i>]. |
| Psalms 49:6 | which is written: “The iniquity of my heel encircles me” | Avodah Zarah18a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> why was <b>his daughter</b> condemned <b>to sit in a brothel? As R' Yoḥanan says: Once, the daughter of</b> R' Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>was walking before the nobles of Rome, </b> and they <b>said</b> to each other: <b>How pleasant are the steps of this young woman. </b> Upon hearing this, <b>she immediately took care</b> to keep walking in such a fashion that <b>her steps</b> would continue to be pleasing to them. <b>And this is</b> the same as that <b>which R' Shimon ben Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The iniquity of my heel encircles me”</b> (Psalms 49:6)? It means that <b>the sins that a person tramples with one’s heel in this world, </b> i.e., dismisses and pays no attention to them as they seem to lack importance, e.g., the way that one walks, come and <b>encircle him on the Day of Judgment. </b> |
| Psalms 49:11 | about himself: “And they leave their wealth for others” | Gittin 47a:6 | <b>He left and came</b> back home, and after some time had passed <b>he was sitting, eating, and drinking, </b> without concern for his livelihood. <b>His daughter said to him: You don’t want something to lie upon? He said to her: My daughter, my belly is my pillow, </b> and this is enough for me. <b>When he died he left</b> only <b>a <i>kav</i> of saffron</b> as an inheritance, and even so <b>he recited</b> this verse <b>about himself: “And they leave their wealth for others”</b> (Psalms 49:11), meaning that he was pained that he did not use all of his property. He exhibited his confidence that God would provide his needs by not saving money for the future. |
| Psalms 49:12 | your house, as it is written: “Their inward thought [ kirbam ], is that their houses shall continue forever” | Moed Katan9b:6 | When they said that <b>your house should be destroyed and your lodging place should be inhabited, </b> this should be interpreted allegorically. <b>As this world is</b> compared to <b>your lodging place, and the World-to-Come is</b> compared to <b>your house, as it is written: “Their inward thought [<i>kirbam</i>], is that their houses shall continue forever”</b> (Psalms 49:12), and the rabbis said: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“their inward thought [<i>kirbam</i>]”; rather</b> read it as <b>their graves [<i>kivram</i>]. </b> According to this reading, one’s grave is considered his permanent house. The rabbis gave R' Shimon ben Yoḥai’s son a blessing that he should dwell in his temporary home rather than his permanent home, i.e., he should live a long life. |
| Psalms 49:13 | as it is stated: “But man abides not in honor; | Sanhedrin 38b:2 | <b>R' Yoḥanan bar Ḥanina says: Daytime is twelve hours</b> long, and the day Adam the first man was created was divided as follows: In the <b>first hour</b> of the day, <b>his dust was gathered. </b> In the <b>second, </b> an undefined <b>figure was fashioned. </b> In the <b>3rd, his limbs were extended. </b> In the <b>4th, a soul was cast into him. </b> In the <b>5th, he stood on his legs. </b> In the <b>6th, he called</b> the creatures by the <b>names</b> he gave them. In the <b>7th, Eve was paired with him. </b> In the <b>8th, they arose to the bed two, and descended four, </b> i.e., Cain and Abel were immediately born. In the <b>9th, he was commanded not to eat of the Tree</b> of Knowledge. In the <b>10th, he sinned. </b> In the <b>eleventh, he was judged. </b> In the <b>twelfth, he was expelled and left</b> the Garden of Eden, <b>as it is stated: “But man abides not in honor; </b> he is like the beasts that perish” (Psalms 49:13). Adam did not abide, i.e., sleep, in a place of honor for even one night. |
| Psalms 49:13 | Rami bar Abba said: An animal does not overpower a person until he appears to it as an animal, as it is stated: “But man does not abide in honor, he is like the beasts that perish” | Shabbat 151b:10 | <b>Rav Pappa said: We hold</b> that <b>a lion does not pounce upon two</b> people. The Talmud challenges this: <b>But</b> how can that be? <b>We see that it does pounce</b> upon two people. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> statement of Rav Pappa must be <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rami bar Abba said: An animal does not overpower a person until he appears to it as an animal, as it is stated: “But man does not abide in honor, he is like the beasts that perish”</b> (Psalms 49:13). However, animals do not attack people who are human in their spiritual character. In a similar vein, <b>R' Ḥanina said: It is prohibited to sleep alone in a house, and anyone who sleeps alone in a house will be seized by</b> the evil spirit <b>Lilith. </b> |
| Psalms 49:14 | that which is written: “This is the way of them that are foolish | Shabbat 31b:5 | <b>Rava bar Rav Ulla taught: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For there are no pangs [<i>ḥartzubot</i>] at their death and their body is sound”</b> (Psalms 73:4)? <b>God said: Is it not enough for wicked people that they are not anxious [<i>ḥared</i>] or sad [<i>atzuv</i>], </b> <i>ḥartzubot</i> is an acronym of <i>ḥared</i> and <i>atzuv</i>, in anticipation <b>of the day of</b> their <b>death, but</b> also, <b>their heart is as unyielding for them as</b> the entrance to a <b>hall</b> is wide, and they devote no thought to it. <b>And that is</b> what <b>Rabba said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “This is the way of them that are foolish</b> and of those who after them speak approvingly, Selah” (Psalms 49:14)? It means that the <b>wicked know that their path</b> leads <b>to</b> eternal <b>death, </b> but <b>they have fat on their kidneys</b> that prevents that realization from entering their hearts. <b>Lest you say that it is</b> simply <b>forgotten from them; </b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And of those who after them speak approvingly, Selah”</b> (Psalms 49:14). They are aware of their fate and speak of it, but it does not affect them. |
| Psalms 49:15 | will not terminate, as it is stated: “And their form shall wear away the netherworld, so that there be no dwelling for Him” | Rosh Hashanah17a:5 | <b>Gehenna will terminate, but they</b> still <b>will not terminate, as it is stated: “And their form shall wear away the netherworld, so that there be no dwelling for Him”</b> (Psalms 49:15); that is to say, Gehenna itself will be worn away before their punishment has come to an end. <b>And why</b> are they punished <b>so severely? Because they stretched out their hands against</b> God’s <b>dwelling, </b> the Temple, and everything else that is sanctified, <b>as it is stated: “So that there be no dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] for Him. ” Dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] is referring</b> here <b>only to the Temple, as it is stated: “I have built You a house for dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] in”</b> (I Kings 8:13). <b>And about them Hannah said: “The adversaries of YHWH shall be broken in pieces”</b> (I Samuel 2:10). |
| Psalms 50:1 | was created from Zion, as it is stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, the Lord God | Yoma 54b:4 | <b>And the Rabbis say: </b> The world <b>was created from Zion, as it is stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, YHWH God</b> has spoken and called the earth, from the rising of the sun to its place of setting” (Psalms 50:1), <b>and it states: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, </b> God has shined forth” (Psalms 50:2). The Mishnah is taught in accordance with this last opinion. |
| Psalms 50:2 | and it states: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, | Yoma 54b:4 | <b>And the Rabbis say: </b> The world <b>was created from Zion, as it is stated: “A Psalm of Asaph.

The Mishnah is taught in accordance with this last opinion. |
| Psalms 50:3 | is stated: “And around Him it storms [ nisara ] mightily” | Bava Kamma50a:22 | <b>R' Aḥa says: </b> Although Neḥunya ensured that others would have water, <b>even so, his son died of thirst, </b> fulfilling that which <b>is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3). This <b>teaches that God is scrupulous with those around Him, </b> i.e., the righteous, <b>even</b> to the extent <b>of a hairsbreadth [<i>hasa’ara</i>], </b> so that even minor transgressions elicit a severe punishment. <b>R' Neḥunya says: </b> The same idea may be learned <b>from here, </b> in the following verse: <b>“A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8), indicating that God is most careful and exacting with those that surround Him, i.e., the righteous. |
| Psalms 50:3 | as is stated: “And around Him it storms [ nisara ] mightily” | Yevamot 121b:8 | <b>R' Abba said: Even so, the son</b> of Neḥunya the well digger <b>died of thirst, </b> and the merit of his father, who attended to the water supply, did not protect him, <b>as is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3), <b>which teaches that God is exacting with His surroundings, </b> i.e., the righteous who are close to Him, <b>up to a hairsbreadth [<i>sa’ara</i>], </b> so that even slight deviations can elicit severe punishment. <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> This idea is derived <b>from here: “A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all that are about Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8). This indicates that God is most feared by those that are nearest to Him, i.e., the righteous, because He is more exacting of them. |
| Psalms 50:4 | and He judges them as one, as it is stated: “He calls to the heavens above and to the earth that He may judge His people” | Sanhedrin 91b:3 | <b>So too, God brings the soul</b> on the day of judgment <b>and casts it</b> back <b>into the body, </b> as they were when they sinned, <b>and He judges them as one, as it is stated: “He calls to the heavens above and to the earth that He may judge His people”</b> (Psalms 50:4). <b>“He calls to the heavens above”; this is the soul, </b> which is heavenly. <b>“And to the earth that He may judge His people”; this is the body, </b> which is earthly. |
| Psalms 50:5 | says: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering” | Sanhedrin 108a:3 | The members of <b>the generation of the wilderness have no share in the World-to-Come and will not stand in judgment, as it is stated: “In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die”</b> (Numbers 14:35). “They shall be consumed” indicates in this world; “and there they shall die” indicates for the World-to-Come; this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. R' Eliezer says: </b> The members of the generation of the wilderness were essentially righteous, and <b>about them</b> the verse <b>says: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering”</b> (Psalms 50:5). It is they who entered into the covenant with God and they will certainly be rewarded in the future. |
| Psalms 50:5 | Rabbi Eliezer says: They come to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering” | Sanhedrin 110b:3 | <b>R' Eliezer says: They come to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering”</b> (Psalms 50:5). Those who left Egypt entered into an eternal covenant with God at Mount Sinai. <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“Wherefore I took an oath in My anger”? </b> It must be understood: <b>In My anger I took an oath, and I reconsidered</b> and dissolved the oath when My anger subsided. |
| Psalms 50:11 | and the ziz sadai is Mine” | Bava Batra73b:7 | <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain bird that was standing with water up to its ankles [<i>kartzuleih</i>] and its head</b> was <b>in the sky.

And a bat kol emerged and said to us: Do not go down here, as the ax of a carpenter fell</b> into it <b>seven years</b> ago <b>and</b> it has still <b>not reached the bottom. And</b> this is <b>not because the water is so large</b> and deep. <b>Rather, </b> it is <b>because the water is turbulent. Rav Ashi said: And that</b> bird <b>is</b> called <b><i>ziz sadai</i>, </b> wild beast, <b>as it is written: </b> “I know all the fowls of the mountains; <b>and the <i>ziz sadai</i> is Mine”</b> (Psalms 50:11). |
| Psalms 50:12 | the verse states: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and everything within it” | Menachot 110a:19 | <b>And lest you say</b> that God <b>needs</b> these offerings <b>for consumption, </b> in which case a larger offering would be preferable to a smaller one, <b>the verse states: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and everything within it”</b> (Psalms 50:12). <b>And it is stated: “For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine”</b> (Psalms 50:10–11). Similarly, it is stated in the following verse: <b>“Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ”</b> (Psalms 50:13). |
| Psalms 50:13 | “Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?” | Menachot 110a:19 | <b>And lest you say</b> that God <b>needs</b> these offerings <b>for consumption, </b> in which case a larger offering would be preferable to a smaller one, <b>the verse states: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and everything within it”</b> (Psalms 50:12). <b>And it is stated: “For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

Similarly, it is stated in the following verse: <b>“Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? ”</b> (Psalms 50:13). |
| Psalms 50:16 | At the last one, he said to him: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “And to the wicked [ velerasha ] God says, what is it for you to declare My statutes” | Chagigah 15b:2 | <b>He brought him to another synagogue, until he had brought him into thirteen synagogues, </b> where <b>all</b> the children <b>recited to him similar</b> verses that speak of the hopeless situation of the wicked. <b>At the last one, he said to him: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “And to the wicked [<i>velerasha</i>] God says, what is it for you to declare My statutes”</b> (Psalms 50:16). The Talmud relates: <b>That child had a stutter, </b> so <b>it sounded as though he were saying to him: <i>Vele’elisha</i>, </b> i.e., and to Elisha, <b>God says. </b> This made Elisha think the child was deliberately insulting him. <b>Some say</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>had a knife, and he tore</b> the child <b>apart and sent him to</b> the <b>thirteen synagogues. And others say</b> that <i>Aḥer</i> merely <b>said: Had I a knife, I would have torn him apart. </b> |
| Psalms 50:16 | which is written: “But to the wicked, God says: What have you to do to declare My statutes, | Sanhedrin 106b:7 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But to the wicked, God says: What have you to do to declare My statutes, </b> and that you have taken My covenant in your mouth” (Psalms 50:16)? <b>God said to Doeg the wicked: Why do you speak of My statutes</b> and My Torah? <b>When you reach</b> the Torah <b>portion of murderers and</b> the Torah <b>portion of slanderers, how do you teach them? </b> You have violated both. With regard to the end of that verse: <b>“And that you have taken My covenant in your mouth”</b> (Psalms 50:16), <b>R' Ami says: Doeg’s Torah is only</b> insincere <b>lip service, </b> as it is in his mouth but not in his heart. He does not have a profound understanding of the Torah and does not commit himself to the performance of its mitzvot. |
| Psalms 50:16 | “But unto the wicked [ velarasha ] God says: | Sukkah 55a:4 | <b>And furthermore, </b> contrary to the statement of R' Aḥa, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the intermediate days of the Festival, on the first</b> day, <b>what would they say</b> as the song accompanying the offering on that day? <b>“Ascribe [<i>havu</i>] unto YHWH, O you sons of might”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>On the second</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm that contains the verse: <b>“But unto the wicked [<i>velarasha</i>] God says: </b> What have you to do to declare My statutes? ” (Psalms 50:16). <b>On the 3rd</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm containing the verse: <b>“Who [<i>mi</i>] will rise up for me against the evildoers? ”</b> (Psalms 94:16). |
| Psalms 50:23 | come thanksgiving, as it is stated: “Whoever sacrifices a thanks-offering honors Me” | Megillah 18a:2 | <b>And after prayer comes, the</b> Temple <b>service will arrive, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar”</b> (Isaiah 56:7). The blessing of restoration of the Temple service follows the blessing of hearing prayer. <b>And when the</b> Temple <b>service comes, </b> with it will also <b>come thanksgiving, as it is stated: “Whoever sacrifices a thanks-offering honors Me”</b> (Psalms 50:23), which teaches that thanksgiving follows sacrifice. Therefore, the blessing of thanksgiving follows the blessing of restoration of the Temple service. |
| Psalms 50:23 | “And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God” | Moed Katan5a:22 | And finally, <b>Ravina said: </b> This obligation is alluded to by the verse <b>“And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God”</b> (Psalms 50:23), meaning that one must mark the pathways that are ritually pure and upon which it is appropriate to walk. |
| Psalms 50:23 | about him: “And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God” | Moed Katan5b:1 | R' Yannai <b>read</b> this verse <b>about him: “And to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God”</b> (Psalms 50:23), for he considered his conduct and determined when it was inappropriate to challenge his master. |
| Psalms 50:23 | They said to him: Yes, Toda shall be executed, as it is written: “Whoever slaughters a thanks-offering [ toda ] honors Me” | Sanhedrin 43a:26 | Then <b>they brought Toda in</b> to stand trial.

| Psalms 50:23 | as though he had honored the Holy One, Blessed be He, in two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is written: “Whoever slaughters a thanks-offering [ toda ] honors Me [ yekhabdaneni ]” | Sanhedrin 43b:1 | § Apropos the last verse cited in this <i>baraita</i>, <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who slaughters his</b> evil <b>inclination</b> after it has tempted him to sin, if he repents <b>and confesses</b> his sin, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he had honored God in two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is written: “Whoever slaughters a thanks-offering [<i>toda</i>] honors Me [<i>yekhabdaneni</i>]”</b> (Psalms 50:23), which can also be read as: Whoever slaughters his evil inclination and confesses [<i>mitvadeh</i>] honors Me, and the two instances of the letter <i>nun</i> in the word <i>yekhabdaneni</i> allude to the two worlds. |
| Psalms 50:23 | merits and sees the salvation of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “And to him that orders his way aright [ vesam derekh ] will I show the salvation of God” | Sotah 5b:3 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>says: Whoever appraises his ways in this world, </b> i.e., whoever carefully considers all his actions before deciding on the proper mode of conduct, <b>merits and sees the salvation of God as it is stated: “And to him that orders his way aright [<i>vesam derekh</i>] will I show the salvation of God”</b> (Psalms 50:23). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“<i>vesam</i>, ”</b> “that orders”; <b>rather, </b> read it as <b><i>vesham derekh</i>, </b> that appraises his way. |
| Psalms 51:5 | as it is stated: “For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me” | Yoma 86b:13 | <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> If one confesses in subsequent years, <b>all the more so is he praiseworthy, </b> as he remembers his earlier sins and is thereby humbled, <b>as it is stated: “For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me”</b> (Psalms 51:5). <b>But how do I establish the</b> meaning of the verse: <b>“Like a dog that returns to its vomit”? </b> It may be established <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: When a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it is permitted to him. </b> The Talmud is surprised at this: <b>Can it enter your mind that it is permitted to him</b> because he has sinned twice? <b>Rather, say it becomes to him as if</b> it were <b>permitted. </b> |
| Psalms 51:6 | which is written: “Against You, only You, have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your eyes; that You are justified when You speak, and right when You judge” | Sanhedrin 107a:8 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Against You, only You, have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your eyes; that You are justified when You speak, and right when You judge”</b> (Psalms 51:6)? <b>David said before God: It is revealed and known before You that if I sought to suppress my</b> evil <b>inclination, I would have suppressed it; but I said: </b> I will sin, so <b>that they will not say a servant overcame his master</b> and withstood the ordeal even though God said that he would not. |
| Psalms 51:6 | to fulfill that which is stated: “That You may be justified when You speak and be right when You judge” | Taanit 11a:13 | With regard to the 3rd section of the verse: <b>“He is just and righteous, ”</b> the rabbis <b>said: At the hour of a person’s departure to his eternal home, all his deeds are enumerated before him</b> and are rendered visible to him once again, <b>and</b> the deeds themselves <b>say to him: You did such and such, in such and such a place, on such and such a day, and he says: Yes, </b> that is exactly what happened. <b>And they say to him: Sign</b> a statement that this is correct, <b>and he signs</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “He makes the hand of every man sign”</b> (Job 37:7). <b>And not only that, </b> but after one has been shown all his deeds, <b>he justifies the judgment upon himself, and says to them: You have judged me well. </b> This response serves <b>to fulfill that which is stated: “That You may be justified when You speak and be right when You judge”</b> (Psalms 51:6). |
| Psalms 51:7 | cycle, as it is stated: “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity” | Niddah 31b:2 | § <b>And R' Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>R' Ami says: A woman becomes pregnant only</b> by having sex <b>close to the onset of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, as it is stated: “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity”</b> (Psalms 51:7). This iniquity is referring to sex close to the woman’s menstrual cycle, when sex is prohibited. Accordingly, David is saying that his mother presumably conceived him at this time. |
| Psalms 51:7 | “And in sin [ uvḥet ] did my mother conceive me” | Niddah 31b:3 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: </b> A woman becomes pregnant only by having sex <b>near</b> the time of her <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath, through which she is purified from her status as a menstruating woman, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the same verse: <b>“And in sin [<i>uvḥet</i>] did my mother conceive me”</b> (Psalms 51:7). |
| Psalms 51:9 | from here: “Purge me [ teḥatte’eni ] with hyssop and I will be pure” | Chullin 27a:4 | <b>Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>] the young bull</b> before YHWH” (Leviticus 1:5), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>bends [<i>shaḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>]</b> through slaughter. The Talmud asks: <b>From where</b> does one ascertain <b>that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of purification? </b> The Talmud answers: It is ascertained from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall purify [<i>veḥitte</i>] the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is ascertained <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop and I will be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). |
| Psalms 51:9 | from here: “Purge me [ teḥatte’eni ] with hyssop, and I shall be pure” | Niddah 31b:4 | The Talmud explains this derivation: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this term “<i>ḥet</i>” is</b> a reference <b>to purity? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to tzara'at of houses: <b>“<i>Veḥittei</i> the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52), <b>and we translate</b> the verse into Aramaic as: <b>And he shall purify the house. And if you wish, say</b> that the interpretation is derived <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop, and I shall be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). Evidently, the root <i>ḥet</i>, <i>tet</i>, <i>alef</i> refers to purification. |
| Psalms 51:9 | from him. He was afflicted with leprosy, as it is stated: “Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow” | Sanhedrin 107a:18 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> For <b>six months David was afflicted with tzara'at and the Shekhina abandoned him and</b> the members of <b>the Sanhedrin dissociated</b> themselves <b>from him.

| Psalms 51:12 | David called it impure, as it is stated: “Create for me a pure heart, O God” | Sukkah 52a:7 | § <b>R' Avira, and some say R' Yehoshua ben Levi, taught: The evil inclination has seven names. God called it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Moses called it uncircumcised, as it is stated: “And circumcise the foreskin of your hearts”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16). <b>David called it impure, as it is stated: “Create for me a pure heart, O God”</b> (Psalms 51:12); <b>by inference, there is an impure</b> heart that is the evil inclination. |
| Psalms 51:14 | The Divine Presence abandoned him, as it is stated: “Restore me to joy of Your salvation; and uphold me with a willing spirit” | Sanhedrin 107a:18 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> For <b>six months David was afflicted with tzara'at and the Shekhina abandoned him and</b> the members of <b>the Sanhedrin dissociated</b> themselves <b>from him.

| Psalms 51:14 | “Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, | Yoma 22b:14 | The Talmud challenges this: <b>There, too, </b> in the incident with Bathsheba, David <b>was not punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body; </b> rather, it was his children who suffered punishment. The Talmud answers: That is <b>not so; he was punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body, </b> for that sin, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: David was stricken with tzara'at</b> for <b>six months</b> after that incident, <b>and the Sanhedrin withdrew from him</b> in protest over his behavior, <b>and the Shekhina</b> also <b>left him. As it is written</b> that David prayed: <b>“May those who fear You return to me, and they who know Your testimonies”</b> (Psalms 119:79). Since he prayed for the return of those who fear God and who know His testimonies, referring to the rabbis of the Sanhedrin, it can be inferred that they had withdrawn from him. <b>And it is written</b> as well: <b>“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, </b> let a vigorous spirit support me” (Psalms 51:14), where David asks for the return of the Holy Spirit, which had left him. |
| Psalms 51:17 | “Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory” | Berakhot 4b:14 | <b>They say</b> in response: <b>Since the rabbis instituted</b> the practice of reciting: <b>Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption, </b> and therefore does not constitute an interruption. <b>As if you fail to say</b> that the sections added by the rabbis are considered no less significant than the original prayers, <b>then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer</b> even <b>in the morning? Didn’t R' Yoḥanan say: Before</b> every prayer <b>one recites</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory”</b> (Psalms 51:17) as a prelude to prayer? <b>Afterward, one recites</b> the verse: <b>“May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You”</b> (Psalms 19:15). Doesn’t the verse: Lord, open my lips, constitute an interruption between redemption and prayer? |
| Psalms 51:17 | one says: “Lord, open my lips, | Berakhot 9b:19 | In practice, the Talmud asks: <b>How is one able to juxtapose redemption and prayer? Didn’t R' Yoḥanan say: At the beginning</b> of prayer, <b>one says: “Lord, open my lips, </b> that my mouth may declare Your glory” (Psalms 51:17), <b>and at the end</b> of prayer one says: <b>“May the words of my mouth</b> and the meditation of my heart <b>be acceptable</b> before You, Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer” (Psalms 19:15). If so, the first verse is an interruption between redemption and prayer. |
| Psalms 51:19 | as though he has sacrificed all the offerings, as it is stated: “The offerings of God are a broken spirit” | Sanhedrin 43b:2 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>says: When the Temple is standing, </b> if <b>a person sacrifices a burnt-offering, he has the reward</b> given <b>for</b> bringing <b>a burnt-offering, </b> and if he sacrifices <b>a meal-offering, he has the reward</b> given <b>for</b> bringing <b>a meal-offering.

| Psalms 51:19 | as if he had sacrificed all the sacrificial offerings, as it is stated: “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit” | Sotah 5b:2 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: Come and see how great the lowly in spirit are before God.

| Psalms 52:3 | which is written: “Why boast of your evil mighty one? The mercy of God endures continually” | Sanhedrin 106b:6 | <b>R' Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why boast of your evil mighty one? The mercy of God endures continually”</b> (Psalms 52:3)? <b>God said to Doeg: Aren’t you mighty in Torah? Why do you boast of evil? Isn’t God’s mercy extended over you continually</b> when you engage in His Torah? |
| Psalms 52:7 | which is written: “God shall likewise destroy you forever” | Sanhedrin 106b:10 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “God shall likewise destroy you forever”</b> (Psalms 52:7)? <b>God said to David: Let Doeg enter the World-to-Come. </b> David <b>said before Him: “God shall likewise destroy you forever, ”</b> i.e., let Doeg not have eternal life. <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He shall pluck you away, and pluck you from your tent, and root you out from the land of the living. Selah”</b> (Psalms 52:7)? <b>God said</b> to David: At least <b>let them state a <i>halakha</i> in the study hall in his name. </b> David <b>said before Him: “He shall pluck you away, and pluck you from your tent, ”</b> i.e., let him be completely removed from the tents of Torah. God said to him: <b>Let him have sons who are rabbis. </b> David said: <b>“And root you out from the land of the living. Selah, ”</b> i.e., let Doeg be entirely uprooted. |
| Psalms 52:7 | “God will likewise break you forever; He will take you up and pluck you from the tent, and uproot you from the land of the living, Selah” | Shevuot 36a:22 | Likewise, the Talmud relates: <b>A certain one of the rabbis sat before Rav Kahana, and he sat and said</b> the verse: <b>“God will likewise break you forever; He will take you up and pluck you from the tent, and uproot you from the land of the living, Selah”</b> (Psalms 52:7). Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Employ a euphemism</b> and formulate it in the 3rd person rather than the second person, so that it will not sound as though you are cursing your teacher. |
| Psalms 52:8 | which is written: “And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him” | Sanhedrin 106b:8 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him”</b> (Psalms 52:8)? <b>Initially, they will fear</b> Doeg due to his success, <b>and ultimately they will laugh</b> when they witness his downfall. |
| Psalms 54:2 | “When the zifim came and said to Saul, does not David | Sotah 48b:18 | <b>Similarly, you</b> can <b>say</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“When the <i>zifim</i> came and said to Saul, does not David</b> hide himself with us” (Psalms 54:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>zifim</i>, </b> mentioned in this verse? <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> It means <b>people who</b> would <b>falsify [<i>hamzayyefin</i>] their words.

| Psalms 55:14 | “But it was you, a man my equal, my master [ alufi ], and my familiar friend” | Sanhedrin 106b:22 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Initially, David called Ahithophel his teacher, and eventually, he called him his colleague, and ultimately, he called him his student. Initially, </b> David <b>called</b> Ahithophel <b>his teacher, </b> as it is stated: <b>“But it was you, a man my equal, my master [<i>alufi</i>], and my familiar friend”</b> (Psalms 55:14); a teacher is known as <i>aluf</i> as he trains [<i>me’alef</i> ] his students. <b>And eventually, he called him his colleague, </b> as it is stated: <b>“We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God with the throng”</b> (Psalms 55:15); the term together indicates that they were equals. <b>And ultimately, he called him his student, </b> as it is stated: <b>“Even my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, </b> |
| Psalms 55:15 | “We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God with the throng” | Sanhedrin 106b:22 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Initially, David called Ahithophel his teacher, and eventually, he called him his colleague, and ultimately, he called him his student.

| Psalms 55:15 | as it is stated: “We took sweet counsel together, in the House of God we walked with the throng” | Yoma 24b:15 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> It was done this way <b>in order to create a commotion throughout</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, </b> as the priests would converge from all over to assemble there, <b>as it is stated: “We took sweet counsel together, in the House of God we walked with the throng”</b> (Psalms 55:15). This verse teaches that it is proper to stir up a commotion and to cause public excitement in the course of the Temple services and the preliminary steps leading up to them, such as the assignment of tasks to the priests. |
| Psalms 55:15 | “In the House of God we walked with the throng” | Yoma 25a:7 | <b>And if it were to enter your mind</b> to say the opposite, that the chamber stood <b>entirely in the non-sacred</b> area, how could <b>the lottery</b> be held <b>in the east? Aren’t we required</b> to fulfill the verse: <b>“In the House of God we walked with the throng”</b> (Psalms 55:15), from where it was derived earlier that it is desirable that the lotteries cause a commotion in the House of God, i.e., in the sacred area of the Temple? If the lottery were held in a non-sacred area, <b>there</b> would <b>not be</b> a fulfillment of this verse. <b>Rather, </b> one must <b>conclude from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that the chamber was situated <b>half in the sacred</b> area of the Temple <b>and half in the non-sacred</b> area. |
| Psalms 55:18 | written: “Evening and morning and afternoon | Berakhot 20b:5 | We also learned in the Mishnah that women, slaves, and children are <b>obligated in prayer. </b> The Talmud explains that, although the mitzva of prayer is only in effect at particular times, which would lead to the conclusion that women are exempt, nevertheless, since prayer <b>is</b> supplication for <b>mercy</b> and women also require divine mercy, they are obligated. However, <b>lest you say: Since</b> regarding prayer it is <b>written: “Evening and morning and afternoon</b> I pray and cry aloud and He hears my voice” (Psalms 55:18), perhaps prayer should be <b>considered a time-bound, positive mitzva</b> and women would be exempt, the Mishnah <b>teaches us</b> that, fundamentally, the mitzva of prayer is not time-bound and, therefore, everyone is obligated. |
| Psalms 55:18 | as it is written: “Evening and morning and noon, | Berakhot 31a:23 | Daniel does not describe how these three prayers are distributed during the day. I <b>might have</b> thought <b>that one may include all</b> three prayers <b>at one time; it has already been articulated by David</b> that one may not do so, <b>as it is written: “Evening and morning and noon, </b> I pray and cry aloud and He hears my voice” (Psalms 55:18). |
| Psalms 55:19 | “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me; | Berakhot 55b:9 | <b>And three redemptions, as it is written: </b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me; </b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19); <b><b>“The redeemed of YHWH shall return, </b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; <b>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35: 10); <br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel? <br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45). |
| Psalms 55:20 | those that have no exchange, and fear not God” | Bava Batra116a:5 | The Talmud presents a related statement. Concerning the verse: “God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah; <b>those that have no exchange, and fear not God”</b> (Psalms 55:20), <b>R' Yoḥanan and R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> each interpret the verse in a different manner. <b>One says</b> that this is a reference to <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a son</b> to inherit from him, as he does not leave anyone to serve in exchange, i.e., as a replacement, for him; <b>and one says</b> that this is a reference to <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a student</b> to serve in exchange for him. |
| Psalms 55:23 | “Cast upon the Lord your yehav ” | Megillah 18a:28 | The Talmud relates additional examples: <b>The rabbis did not know what is</b> meant by the word <i>yehav</i> in the verse: <b>“Cast upon YHWH your <i>yehav</i>”</b> (Psalms 55:23). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: One time I was traveling with a certain Arab</b> [<b><i>Tayya’a</i></b>] <b>and I was carrying a load, and he said to me: Take your <i>yehav</i> and throw it on my camel, </b> and I understood that <i>yehav</i> means a load or burden. |
| Psalms 55:23 | “Cast your load [ yehavkha ] upon the Lord and He will sustain you” | Rosh Hashanah26b:6 | <b>The rabbis</b> also <b>did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>yehavkha</i> in the verse: <b>“Cast your load [<i>yehavkha</i>] upon YHWH and He will sustain you”</b> (Psalms 55:23). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: One day I was traveling with a certain Arab [<i>Tayya’a</i>], </b> and <b>I was carrying a load, and he said to me: Take your <i>yehav</i> and cast it on my camel, </b> and from this I understood that <i>yehav</i> means a load. |
| Psalms 55:24 | that it is written: “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days” | Sanhedrin 106b:2 | <b>A certain heretic said to R' Ḥanina: Have you heard how old Balaam was</b> when he died? R' Ḥanina <b>said to him: It is not written</b> explicitly in the Torah. <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days”</b> (Psalms 55:24), this indicates that he was <b>thirty-three or thirty-four years old, </b> less than half the standard seventy-year lifespan. The heretic <b>said to him: You have spoken well, I myself saw the notebook of Balaam and it was written therein: Balaam the lame was thirty-three years old when Pinehas the highwayman killed him. </b> |
| Psalms 55:24 | “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days” | Sanhedrin 106b:21 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Doeg and Ahithophel did not reach half of their</b> allotted <b>days, </b> as they died before the age of thirty-five, half of the standard lifetime mentioned in the verse: “The days of our years are seventy years” (Psalms 90:10). <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days”</b> (Psalms 55:24); <b>all the years of Doeg were only thirty-four, and</b> the years <b>of Ahithophel were only thirty-three. </b> |
| Psalms 55:24 | And it is written: “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days” | Sanhedrin 69b:10 | <b>And it is written: “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days”</b> (Psalms 55:24). <b>And</b> in keeping with this verse, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of Doeg’s years were only thirty-four and Ahithophel’s were only thirty-three. </b> Neither reached the age of thirty-five, half of the normal life span of seventy years. Based on this, one can calculate: <b>How many</b> years did Ahithophel live? <b>Thirty-three. Subtract seven</b> years, <b>Solomon’s</b> age at the time of Ahithophel’s death, which <b>leaves</b> Ahithophel <b>twenty-six</b> years old at the time of Solomon’s birth. <b>Subtract two</b> more <b>years for three pregnancies, </b> one preceding the birth of Eliam the son of Ahithophel, one preceding the birth of Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, and one preceding the birth of Solomon, son of Bathsheba. <b>It turns out</b> that three generations were born in twenty-four years, and <b>that each and every</b> parent <b>begot</b> a child <b>at</b> the age of <b>eight. </b> |
| Psalms 56:1 | This is as it is written: “For the leader, upon yonat eilem reḥokim , a psalm [ mikhtam ] of David” | Sotah 10b:5 | The Talmud comments: <b>This is as it is written: “For the leader, upon <i>yonat eilem reḥokim</i>, a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> (Psalms 56:1). <b>R' Yoḥanan says</b> the verse means: <b>From the moment that her signs were distanced [<i>reḥokim</i>], she became like a mute dove [<i>yona illemet</i>]. </b> And the phrase <b>“a psalm [<i>mikhtam</i>] of David”</b> means: The one <b>from whom David emerged, as he was modest [<i>makh</i>] and flawless [<i>tam</i>] with everyone. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates <b>that <i>makkato</i>, </b> the place on his body that would have required wounding [<i>makka</i>], <b>was complete [<i>tama</i>], </b> i.e., <b>that</b> David <b>was born circumcised. Alternatively, <i>mikhtam</i></b> indicates that <b>just as in his youth</b> David <b>made himself small in front of one who was greater than him</b> in order <b>to learn Torah</b> from that person, <b>so too, when he became great</b> and was crowned king, he still behaved in this manner, so that his modesty, <i>makh</i>, was complete, <i>tam</i>, all of his life. |
| Psalms 56:9 | and places them in His treasury, as it is stated: “You have counted my wanderings, put my tears into your bottle, are they not in your book?” | Shabbat 105b:10 | Apropos the laws of mourning for an upright person and a Torah scholar, the Talmud cites that which <b>R' Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: Anyone who sheds tears over an upright person, God counts</b> his tears <b>and places them in His treasury, as it is stated: “You have counted my wanderings, put my tears into your bottle, are they not in your book? ”</b> (Psalms 56:9). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who is lazy in eulogizing a</b> Torah <b>scholar, it is fitting to bury him alive, as it is stated: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat-seraḥ, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Ga’ash”</b> (Joshua 24:30). This <b>teaches that the mountain raged against them to kill them</b> because they did not eulogize him appropriately. <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever is lazy in eulogizing a Sage does not live</b> a <b>long</b> life, and his punishment is <b>measure for measure. </b> Since he was unconcerned with the death of the Sage, in the heavens they will be unconcerned with his death. God conducts Himself in this manner, <b>as it is stated: “In full measure [<i>besase’a</i>], when You send her away You contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8), and the rabbis derived that God punishes from the words: “You contend with her,” and He does so measure for measure, <i>se’a</i> for <i>se’a</i>, from the word <i>sase’a</i> in the verse above. |
| Psalms 56:11 | “In God, I will praise His word; in the Lord, I will praise His word” | Berakhot 60b:9 | <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: </b> The proof is <b>from here, </b> as it is stated: <b>“In God, I will praise His word; in YHWH, I will praise His word”</b> (Psalms 56:11). The Talmud explains that <b>In God, I will praise His word; that is</b> the revelation of God’s <b>attribute of benevolence, </b> while: <b>In YHWH, I will praise His word; that is the attribute of suffering; </b> even if God brings suffering to bear upon me, I will still praise Him. |
| Psalms 57:1 | a mikhtam of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave” | Berakhot 10a:8 | In explaining passages from Psalms, the Talmud relates another instance of a response to the question of a heretic: <b>A certain heretic said to R' Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1), <b>and</b> similarly <b>it is said: </b> “To the chief musician, <i>al tashḥet</i>, <b>a <i>mikhtam</i> of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave”</b> (Psalms 57:1). <b>Which event was first? Since the event with Saul was first, </b> it would have been appropriate <b>to write it first. </b> |
| Psalms 57:9 | “Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will wake the dawn” | Berakhot 4a:3 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Adda, and some say Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Idi, said: </b> From <b>what verse</b> is it derived that David’s lyre would wake him at midnight? <b>“Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will wake the dawn”</b> (Psalms 57:9). This means that the playing lyre has already woken, and now I must engage in Torah study until dawn. |
| Psalms 57:9 | “Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn” | Sanhedrin 16b:3 | <b>R' Yitzḥak, son of Rav Adda, and some say R' Yitzḥak bar Avudimi, said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that David’s lyre would awaken him at midnight? <b>“Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn”</b> (Psalms 57:9). This means that the self-playing lyre has already awoken, and now I must engage in Torah study until dawn. |
| Psalms 57:11 | is written: “For Your mercy is great unto the heavens, | Pesachim 50b:5 | On the topic of reward for a mitzva fulfilled without intent, <b>Rava raised a contradiction: </b> It <b>is written: “For Your mercy is great unto the heavens, </b> and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 57:11); <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“For Your mercy is great above the heavens, </b> and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 108:5). <b>How so? </b> How can these verses be reconciled? The Talmud explains: <b>Here, </b> where the verse says that God’s mercy is above the heavens, it is referring to a case where <b>one performs</b> a mitzva <b>for its own sake; and here, </b> where the verse says that God’s mercy reaches the heavens, it is referring to a case where <b>one performs</b> a mitzva <b>not for its own sake. </b> Even a mitzva performed with ulterior motives garners reward, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always engage in Torah</b> study and performance of <b>mitzvot, even if</b> he does so <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, as through</b> the performance of mitzvot <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, </b> one gains understanding and <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for their</b> own <b>sake. </b> |
| Psalms 58:2 | which is written: “Do you indeed [ ha’umnam ] speak as a righteous company [ elem ]? Do you judge with equity [ meisharim ] the sons of men” | Chullin 89a:10 | <b>R' Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Do you indeed [<i>ha’umnam</i>] speak as a righteous company [<i>elem</i>]? Do you judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men”</b> (Psalms 58:2)? The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>What</b> should be <b>a person’s occupation [<i>umanut</i>] in this world? He should render himself</b> silent <b>as a mute [<i>ilem</i>]. </b> If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that he should render himself as a mute <b>even with regard to words of Torah. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak as a righteous</b> company,” indicating that one should speak the righteous words of Torah. If so, he <b>might</b> have thought that one who speaks words of Torah has the right to <b>become arrogant. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men. ”</b> Even a learned judge must take extra care to judge with equity, and not assume that he will immediately arrive at the correct understanding. |
| Psalms 58:4 | “The wicked are estranged from the womb” | Yoma 83a:1 | <b>“The wicked are estranged from the womb”</b> (Psalms 58:4), i.e., it is clear they are estranged already in their mother’s womb. Indeed, <b>Shabbetai the hoarder of fruits came out of her. </b> He hoarded fruit during years of famine in order to inflate its price and profit at the expense of poor people. |
| Psalms 58:9 | “As a snail that melts and disappears; like the fall of a young mole [ eshet ] that has not seen the sun” | Moed Katan6b:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term <b><i>ishut</i>? Rav Yehuda said: </b> An <i>ishut</i> is <b>a creature that has no eyes, </b> a rodent that digs holes in the ground and can cause damage to roots and vegetables. <b>Rava bar Yishmael said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya</b> who <b>said: What is the verse</b> that indicates the identity of the <i>ishut</i>? <b>“As a snail that melts and disappears; like the fall of a young mole [<i>eshet</i>] that has not seen the sun”</b> (Psalms 58:9). It is understood that this creature has not seen the sun because it does not have eyes. |
| Psalms 58:11 | eyes fell out and they fell on the legs of Jacob. Jacob opened his eyes and smiled. And this is that which is written: “The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked” | Sotah 13a:10 | The Talmud relates: <b>Hushim, the son of Dan, was there and his ears were heavy, </b> i.e., he was hard of hearing. <b>He said to them: What</b> is <b>this</b> that is delaying the burial? <b>And they said to him: This one, </b> Esau, <b>is preventing</b> us from burying Jacob <b>until Naphtali comes</b> back <b>from the land of Egypt</b> with the bill of sale. <b>He said to them: And until Naphtali comes</b> back <b>from the land of Egypt will</b> our <b>father’s father lie in degradation? He took a club [<i>kulepa</i>] and hit</b> Esau <b>on the head, </b> and Esau’s <b>eyes fell out and they fell on the legs of Jacob. Jacob opened his eyes and smiled. And this is that which is written: “The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 58:11). |
| Psalms 59:7 | as it is stated: “They return at evening; they howl like a dog, and go round about the city” | Sanhedrin 109a:14 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they know not the light”</b> (Job 24:16)? This <b>teaches that they would set their sights on property owners. </b> They would take one <b>and</b> they would <b>give him balsam, </b> whose smell diffuses, <b>and</b> the property owner would <b>place it in his treasury. In the evening, </b> the people of Sodom <b>would come and sniff it</b> out <b>like a dog</b> and discover the location of the property owner’s treasury, <b>as it is stated: “They return at evening; they howl like a dog, and go round about the city”</b> (Psalms 59:7). <b>And</b> after discovering the location <b>they would come and dig there, and they would take that property. </b> |
| Psalms 60:9 | and it is written: “Judah is my governor” | Yevamot 62b:7 | <b>Rather, </b> the proof is <b>from here: “And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir, the father of Gilead…and she bore him Segub”</b> (I Chronicles 2:21), <b>and it is written: “Out of Machir came down governors”</b> (Judges 5:14), <b>and it is written: “Judah is my governor”</b> (Psalms 60:9). Consequently, the governors, who were from the tribe of Judah, were also called the sons of Machir, who was from the tribe of Manasseh. This must be because they were the children of Machir’s daughter and Hezron, indicating that grandchildren are considered like children. |
| Psalms 60:9 | Judah also, as it is written: “Judah is my lawgiver” | Yoma 26a:6 | Apropos this passage in Deuteronomy, <b>Rava said: You do not find a young Torah scholar who gives</b> halakhic <b>instruction unless he comes from the tribe of Levi or from the tribe of Issachar. </b> The assertion with regard to the tribe of <b>Levi</b> is <b>as it is written: “They shall teach Jacob Your ordinances</b> and Israel Your law” (Deuteronomy 33:10). And the assertion with regard to the tribe of <b>Issachar</b> is <b>as it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33). The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> that scholars come from the tribe of <b>Judah also, as it is written: “Judah is my lawgiver”</b> (Psalms 60:9). Rava answers: While it is true that the tribe of Judah also taught Torah, in my statement <b>I was speaking</b> only <b>of those who</b> can <b>draw conclusions according to the <i>halakha</i>. </b> Although Judah produces great scholars, men capable of translating abstract analysis of the Torah into legal principles come from the two tribes mentioned. |
| Psalms 60:12 | “Have You not rejected us, O God, so that You go not forth, O God, with our hosts?” | Gittin 57a:8 | In the end it was the words issuing from <b>his</b> own <b>mouth</b> that <b>caused bar Deroma to stumble, as he uttered</b> this verse in complaint against God: <b>“Have You not rejected us, O God, so that You go not forth, O God, with our hosts? ”</b> (Psalms 60:12). The Talmud asks: But did not <b>David also say this? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>David uttered</b> these words <b>as a question, </b> wondering whether they were true, whereas bar Deroma pronounced them as a statement of fact. |
| Psalms 61:5 | which is written: “I will dwell in Your tent forever [ olamim ]” | Bekhorot 31b:9 | The Talmud relates: <b>Rav Idi, the attendant [<i>saraseih</i>] of Rav Sheshet, heard</b> this explanation <b>from</b> Rav Sheshet. Rav Idi <b>went and stated</b> the matter <b>in the study hall, but did not say it in his</b> master’s <b>name. Rav Sheshet heard</b> what he had done and <b>was annoyed. </b> Rav Sheshet <b>said: The one who stung me, let him be stung by a scorpion. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav Sheshet, what difference does it make to him</b> whether or not his interpretation was cited in his name? The Talmud answers that this is <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will dwell in Your tent forever [<i>olamim</i>]”</b> (Psalms 61:5)? Rav asked: <b>But is it possible for a person to live in two worlds [<i>olamim</i>], </b> this world and the next, simultaneously? |
| Psalms 61:5 | which is written: “I will dwell in Your tent in worlds” | Yevamot 96b:18 | Later, after calming down, <b>he said to</b> R' Ami and R' Asi: <b>Why don’t you know how to appease me like our colleague ben Idi? </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And R' Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that <b>he was so angry</b> about this matter? The Talmud answers that this is <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will dwell in Your tent in worlds”</b> (Psalms 61:5), literally, forever? <b>And is it possible for a person to live in two worlds</b> simultaneously? <b>Rather, David said before God: God!, let it be Your will</b> |
| Psalms 61:8 | “May he be enthroned before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him” | Eruvin 86a:2 | In explanation of this story, the Talmud comments: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>honor the wealthy, </b> and <b>R' Akiva would</b> likewise <b>honor the wealthy, in accordance with Rava bar Mari’s interpretation</b> of the verse: <b>“May he be enthroned before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him”</b> (Psalms 61:8). <b>When may he be enthroned before God forever? When he appoints</b> [<b><i>man</i></b>] <b>mercy and truth that they may preserve him. </b> Rava bar Mari explains the word <i>man</i> as referring to portions of food and interprets the verse as follows: If one provides food to others, he deserves to be enthroned before God, to be shown honor and respect. Consequently, it is proper to honor the wealthy who bestow such kindnesses. |
| Psalms 62:4 | which is written: “How long will you seek to overwhelm a man? You will all be murdered like a leaning wall or a tottering fence” | Sanhedrin 109a:13 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “How long will you seek to overwhelm a man? You will all be murdered like a leaning wall or a tottering fence”</b> (Psalms 62:4)? This <b>teaches that</b> the people of Sodom <b>set their sights on property owners. </b> They would take one <b>and place him alongside an inclined, </b> flimsy <b>wall</b> that was about to fall, <b>and push it upon him</b> to kill him, <b>and</b> then <b>they</b> would <b>come and take his property. </b> |
| Psalms 62:12 | Abaye says: As the verse states: “God has spoken once, twice I have heard this; that strength belongs to God” | Sanhedrin 34a:12 | § The Talmud discusses the ruling of R' Yoḥanan: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Abaye says: As the verse states: “God has spoken once, twice I have heard this; that strength belongs to God”</b> (Psalms 62:12). Abaye explains: <b>One verse</b> is stated by God and from it <b>emerge several explanations, but one explanation does not emerge from several verses. </b> Alternatively, <b>the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> that the verse states: “Is not My word like as fire? says YHWH; <b>and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as this hammer breaks</b> a stone <b>into several fragments, so too, one verse</b> is stated by God <b>and</b> from it <b>emerge several explanations. </b> |
| Psalms 62:13 | contradiction: It is written: “But to you, O Lord, belongs kindness” | Rosh Hashanah17b:3 | <b>R' Elazar raised a</b> similar <b>contradiction: It is written: “But to you, O Lord, belongs kindness”</b> (Psalms 62:13), implying that God acts beyond the letter of the law, <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds, ”</b> implying that He rewards and punishes measure for measure. R' Elazar answered: <b>Initially, </b> at the time of judgment: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds”; but in the end, </b> at the time of punishment: <b>“But to You, O Lord, belongs kindness. ”</b> |
| Psalms 63:5 | that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands” | Berakhot 16b:17 | The Talmud cites an aggadic statement concerning prayer and the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>R' Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands”</b> (Psalms 63:5)? <b>So I will bless You as I live, refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, </b> and <b>to Your name I will raise my hands, refers to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, </b> which is characterized as lifting one’s hands to God. <b>And if one does so, </b> recites <i>Shema</i> and prays, <b>the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 63:6). <b>And not only</b> does he receive this reward, <b>but he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “With lips of joys [<i>renanot</i>], my mouth praises You”</b> (Psalms 63:6). The plural, joys, refers to two joys, that of this world and that of the World-to-Come. |
| Psalms 63:6 | the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied” | Berakhot 16b:17 | The Talmud cites an aggadic statement concerning prayer and the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>R' Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands”</b> (Psalms 63:5)? <b>So I will bless You as I live, refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, </b> and <b>to Your name I will raise my hands, refers to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, </b> which is characterized as lifting one’s hands to God. <b>And if one does so, </b> recites <i>Shema</i> and prays, <b>the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 63:6). <b>And not only</b> does he receive this reward, <b>but he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “With lips of joys [<i>renanot</i>], my mouth praises You”</b> (Psalms 63:6). The plural, joys, refers to two joys, that of this world and that of the World-to-Come. |
| Psalms 63:12 | “But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by Him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped” | Shabbat 33b:1 | <b>for</b> neglecting to separate <b>tithes. R' Elazar ben Yosei, says: </b> <i>Askara</i> comes as punishment for <b>slander. Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> who said it: <b>What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by Him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped”</b> (Psalms 63:12). The punishment for lying is that the mouth will be stopped. <i>Askara</i> affects the mouth along with other parts of the body. |
| Psalms 65:2 | is sentenced to death by the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “For You silence is praise, | Eruvin 19a:3 | But <b>the attribute of God</b> is that <b>one is</b> willingly <b>silent</b> when he <b>is sentenced to death by God, as it is stated: “For You silence is praise, </b> O God in Zion, and to You shall the vow be performed” (Psalms 65:2). <b>And what is more, he praises</b> God for his sufferings, <b>as it is stated: “Praise. ” And what is more, it appears to him as though he were offering a sacrifice</b> in atonement for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “And to You shall the vow be performed. ”</b> |
| Psalms 65:2 | which is written: “For You silence is praise” | Megillah 18a:11 | The Talmud relates: <b>R' Yehuda, a man of Kefar Gibboraya, and some say</b> he was <b>a man of Kefar Gibbor Ĥayil, taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For You silence is praise”</b> (Psalms 65:2)? <b>The</b> best <b>remedy of all is silence, </b> i.e., the optimum form of praising God is silence. The Talmud relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Israel to Babylonia, <b>he said: In the West, </b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say</b> an adage: If <b>a word is</b> worth one <b><i>sela</i>, silence is</b> worth <b>two. </b> |
| Psalms 65:7 | through strength and through might, as it is written: “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, who is girded about with might” | Chagigah 12a:14 | Scriptural proof is provided for this statement as follows: It was created <b>through wisdom and through understanding, as it is written: “YHWH founded earth with wisdom, and established the heavens with understanding”</b> (Proverbs 3:19); <b>through knowledge, as it is written: “With His knowledge the depths were broken up”</b> (Proverbs 3:20); <b>through strength and through might, as it is written: “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, who is girded about with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7); <b>through rebuke, as it is written: “The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke”</b> (Job 26:11); <b>through righteousness and justice, as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>through kindness and mercy, as it is written: “Remember Your mercies, O Lord, and Your kindnesses, for they are from times of old”</b> (Psalms 25:6). |
| Psalms 65:7 | “Who sets firm the mountains with Your strength; Who is girded with might” | Taanit 2a:10 | Rabba bar Sheila elaborates on this verbal analogy. <b>It is written here: “Who does great things that are beyond comprehension, ” and it is written there, </b> with regard to the creation of the world: <b>“Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, YHWH, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint or weary? His discernment is beyond comprehension”</b> (Isaiah 40:28). This shows that both creation and rainfall are beyond comprehension. <b>And</b> concerning the creation of the world, <b>it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Who sets firm the mountains with Your strength; Who is girded with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7). From this verse it can be inferred that rainfall, like the creation of the world, reflects God’s might. |
| Psalms 65:7 | “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains; | Taanit 9b:13 | <b>As it is stated, </b> with regard to the creation of the world: <b>“Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10), <b>and</b> as an example of this <b>it is written: “Who gives rain upon the earth”</b> (Job 5:9–10). <b>And it is written below: “Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, YHWH, </b> the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint and is not weary; <b>His discernment is past finding out”</b> (Isaiah 40:28). The repetition of “past finding out” indicates that rainfall is as wondrous as the creation of the world. The Talmud adds: <b>And it is written</b> in a psalm that deals with rainfall: <b>“Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains; </b> Who is girded about with might” (Psalms 65:7). |
| Psalms 65:10 | to rain, as it is written: “You have remembered the earth and have watered it; greatly enriching it, with the pool of God that is full of water” | Taanit 8b:3 | Lastly, an expression of <b>remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>remembering is</b> also <b>stated</b> in connection <b>to rain. Remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, as it is written: “And YHWH remembered Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>to rain, as it is written: “You have remembered the earth and have watered it; greatly enriching it, with the pool of God that is full of water”</b> (Psalms 65:10). |
| Psalms 65:11 | “Watering its ridges abundantly, settling its furrows, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth” | Ketubot 10b:11 | Apropos the statement of Rav Ḥana of Baghdad, the Talmud cites additional statements of his. <b>And Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said: Rain irrigates, saturates, and fertilizes</b> the land, <b>and refines</b> the fruit <b>and</b> causes it to <b>proliferate. Rava bar R' Yishmael, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya</b> who <b>said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Watering its ridges abundantly, settling its furrows, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth”</b> (Psalms 65:11). “Watering its ridges abundantly” indicates that the rain irrigates and saturates the land, “You make it soft with showers” indicates that it fertilizes the land, and “You bless its growth” indicates that it refines the fruit and causes it to proliferate. |
| Psalms 65:11 | depths, as it is stated: “Watering [ ravvei ] its ridges abundantly, settling down its furrows, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth” | Taanit 6a:2 | § The Talmud returns to the topic of rain. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first rain [<i>yoreh</i>]</b> is called by this name due to the fact <b>that it instructs [<i>moreh</i>] people to plaster their roofs and to bring in their produce</b> from the fields to their houses <b>and to attend to all their needs</b> in the field before more rain falls. <b>Alternatively, </b> <i>yoreh</i> is referring to the fact <b>that it moistens [<i>marve</i>] the earth and waters it to</b> the <b>depths, as it is stated: “Watering [<i>ravvei</i>] its ridges abundantly, settling down its furrows, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth”</b> (Psalms 65:11). <b>Alternatively, </b> <i>yoreh</i> means <b>that it falls gently and it does not fall vehemently. </b> |
| Psalms 65:11 | As it is stated: “Watering its ridges abundantly; settling down its furrows [ gedudeha ]” | Taanit 8b:16 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is great, as even armies stop fighting on it</b> due to the rain and mud. <b>As it is stated: “Watering its ridges abundantly; settling down its furrows [<i>gedudeha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 65:11). As the word <i>gedudim</i> can mean both furrows or armies and is spelled identically with each meaning, this alludes to the idea that during the winter soldiers become entrenched in place. <b>And R' Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: Rain is withheld only due to those who pledge charity in public but do not give</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he who boasts of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14). |
| Psalms 65:14 | is a time when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, | Rosh Hashanah11a:4 | <b>R' Yehoshua says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the world was created in</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed</b> after its kind, <b>and tree yielding fruit”</b> (Genesis 1:12). <b>Which is the month in which the earth is full of grass and the trees</b> begin to <b>bring forth fruit? You must say</b> that <b>this is Nisan. </b> And further proof that the world was created in Nisan is that when the world was first created, the animals had to breed in order to fill the world, <b>and the period</b> beginning with Nisan <b>is a time when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, </b> and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14). |
| Psalms 65:14 | “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” | Rosh Hashanah8a:4 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>R' Elazar and R' Shimon say: </b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei. R' Yoḥanan said: And both of them, </b> R' Meir and R' Elazar, <b>expounded the same verse</b> in different ways. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing”</b> (Psalms 65:14). <b>R' Meir holds: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows, </b> i.e., when do the rams impregnate the ewes and thereby clothe them? It is <b>at the time when the valleys are wrapped in grain, </b> i.e., when they are covered in grain. <b>And when are the valleys wrapped in grain? </b> It is <b>in Adar. </b> Therefore, the sheep <b>conceive in Adar and give birth</b> five months later <b>in Av, </b> and so it is fitting that <b>their New Year</b> is on the first of <b>Elul, </b> as most of the year’s lambs have been born by then. |
| Psalms 66:12 | of punishments, as it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water” | Bava Metzia75b:9 | <b>R' Ami and R' Asi both say</b> that if one upsets another in this way, it is <b>as though he sentences him to two</b> types <b>of punishments, as it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water”</b> (Psalms 66:12). As the one in control, a creditor is regarded as though he had brought the debtor through fire and water. |
| Psalms 66:12 | it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water. As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water” | Berakhot 6b:25 | <b>R' Ami and R' Asi both said: </b> One who becomes dependent upon others, <b>it is as if he was punished with two punishments: Fire and water. As it is stated: “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and water”</b> (Psalms 66:12). |
| Psalms 66:12 | “You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; | Megillah 11a:2 | <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa introduced this passage with an introduction from here: </b> The verse states: <b>“You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; </b> but You brought us out into abundance” (Psalms 66:12). <b>“Through fire”; </b> this was <b>in the days of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, </b> who cast the righteous into the furnace. <b>“And through water”; </b> this was <b>in the days of Pharaoh, </b> who decreed that all newborn males be cast into the water. <b>“But You brought us out into abundance”; </b> this was <b>in the days of Haman, </b> where abundant feasts played a pivotal role in their peril and salvation. |
| Psalms 66:13 | It is written: “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,” and it is written: “I will come into Your house with burnt | Chagigah 7a:15 | This explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Levi, as R' Levi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, ” and it is written: “I will come into Your house with burnt</b>-offerings, I will perform for You my vows” (Psalms 66:13). R' Levi explained: This is <b>not difficult; here, </b> the verse is referring <b>to sin-</b>offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings, <b>and there, </b> it is referring <b>to burnt</b>-offerings <b>and peace</b>-offerings, concerning which one may bring as many as he likes. |
| Psalms 66:18 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link an evil thought to an action, as it is stated: “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear” | Kiddushin 40a:13 | But <b>God does not link an evil thought to an action, as it is stated: “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, YHWH would not hear”</b> (Psalms 66:18). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Behold I will bring upon these people evil, even the fruit of their thoughts”</b> (Jeremiah 6:19)? In the case of an evil <b>thought that produces fruit, </b> i.e., that leads to an action, <b>God links it to</b> the <b>action</b> and one is punished for the thought as well. If it is <b>a thought that does not produce fruit, God does not link it to</b> the <b>action. </b> |
| Psalms 66:20 | of prayer, as it is stated: “Blessed is God Who did not turn away my prayer” | Berakhot 5a:15 | <b>And one said: Afflictions of love are any that do not cause dereliction</b> in the recitation <b>of prayer, as it is stated: “Blessed is God Who did not turn away my prayer”</b> (Psalms 66:20). Despite his suffering, the afflicted is still capable of praying to God. |
| Psalms 68:5 | living, lofty, exalted One dwells above them in Aravot , as it is stated: “Extol Him Who rides upon the skies [ Aravot ], Whose name is God” | Chagigah 12b:14 | <b>There, </b> in the firmaments, are the <b><i>ofanim</i>, </b> the <b>seraphim, </b> the <b>holy divine creatures, and the ministering angels, and the Throne of Glory.

| Psalms 68:5 | It is stated a third time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is the Lord” | Megillah 31a:13 | <b>It is written in the Torah: “For YHWH your God is the God of gods and YHWH of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets: </b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: </b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, </b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a 3rd time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is YHWH”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6). |
| Psalms 68:6 | afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows” | Megillah 31a:13 | <b>It is written in the Torah: “For YHWH your God is the God of gods and YHWH of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets: </b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: </b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, </b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a 3rd time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is YHWH”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6). |
| Psalms 68:7 | as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “God makes the solitary dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity” | Sanhedrin 22a:20 | <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> It is as <b>difficult to match</b> a couple <b>as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “God makes the solitary dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity”</b> (Psalms 68:7). <b>Do not read</b> the verse as <b>“brings out prisoners”; rather, </b> read it as: <b>Like bringing out prisoners. </b> Accordingly, the act described in the first clause of the verse, God’s causing the solitary to dwell in a house, i.e., to marry, is compared to the act described in the next clause in the verse, i.e., bringing out prisoners. And do not read the verse as <b>“into prosperity [<i>bakkosharot</i>]”; rather, </b> read it as: <b>Crying and singing [<i>bekhi veshirot</i>], </b> which alludes to the splitting of the Red Sea, when there was both crying and singing. |
| Psalms 68:7 | “God makes the solitary individuals dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity [ bakosharot ]” | Sotah 2a:8 | <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: When Reish Lakish would introduce</b> his discussion of the Torah passage <b>of <i>sota</i></b> he would <b>say this: </b> Heaven <b>matches a woman to a man only according to his actions, as it is stated: “For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 125:3), indicating that if one has a wicked wife it is due to his own evil conduct. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: And it is as difficult to match</b> a couple together <b>as</b> was <b>the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated</b> in a verse that speaks of the exodus from Egypt: <b>“God makes the solitary individuals dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity [<i>bakosharot</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:7). God takes single individuals and causes them to dwell in a house by properly matching a man to a woman. This is similar to the exodus from Egypt, which culminated in the splitting of the Red Sea, where He released prisoners into prosperity. |
| Psalms 68:10 | as it is written: “A bountiful rain You will pour down, God; when Your inheritance was weary, You confirmed it” | Chagigah 12b:13 | <b>The souls of the righteous</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And the soul of my master shall be bound in the bundle of life with YHWH, your God”</b> (I Samuel 25:29). <b>Spirits and souls that are to be created</b> are found there, <b>as it is written: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16), which indicates that the spirit to be released into the world, wrapped around a body, is located close to God. <b>The dew that God will use to revive the dead</b> is found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “A bountiful rain You will pour down, God; when Your inheritance was weary, You confirmed it”</b> (Psalms 68:10). |
| Psalms 68:10 | that, in the future, will revive the dead, and He revived them, as it is stated: “You, God, poured down a bountiful rain; when Your inheritance was weary You sustained it” | Shabbat 88b:6 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> From <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God the souls of the Jewish people left</b> their bodies, <b>as it is stated: “My soul departed when he spoke”</b> (Song of Songs 5:6). <b>And since their souls left</b> their bodies <b>from the first utterance, how did they receive the second utterance? </b> Rather, God <b>rained the dew</b> upon them <b>that, in the future, will revive the dead, and He revived them, as it is stated: “You, God, poured down a bountiful rain; when Your inheritance was weary You sustained it”</b> (Psalms 68:10). <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> With <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God the Jewish people retreated</b> in fear <b>twelve <i>mil</i>, and the ministering angels walked them</b> back toward the mountain, <b>as it is stated: “The hosts of angels will scatter [<i>yidodun</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:13). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>yidodun</i>, </b> meaning scattered; <b>rather, </b> read it as <b><i>yedadun</i>, </b> they walked them. |
| Psalms 68:11 | that which is written: “Your flock found a dwelling in it; You, O God, prepare of Your goodness for the poor” | Eruvin 54a:26 | <b>Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Your flock found a dwelling in it; You, O God, prepare of Your goodness for the poor”</b> (Psalms 68:11)? <b>If a person makes himself like an animal that tramples</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it immediately, without being particular about its food, i.e., if a scholar immediately reviews what he has heard from his teacher; <b>and some say, </b> like an animal <b>that soils and eats, </b> i.e., if a scholar is not particular about maintaining his honor during his Torah study, just as an animal is not particular about the quality of its food, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure.

| Psalms 68:12 | which is written: “The Lord gives the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host” | Shabbat 88b:3 | With regard to the revelation at Sinai, <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “YHWH gives the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host”</b> (Psalms 68:12)? It means that <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God divided into seventy languages, </b> a great host. And, similarly, <b>the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> with regard to the verse: “Behold, is My word not like fire, declares YHWH, <b>and like a hammer that shatters a rock? ”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as this hammer breaks</b> a stone <b>into several fragments, so too, each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God divided into seventy languages. </b> The Talmud continues in praise of the Torah. <b>Rav Ḥananel bar Pappa said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Listen, for I will speak royal things, </b> and my lips will open with upright statements” (Proverbs 8:6)? <b>Why are matters of Torah likened to a king?

| Psalms 68:13 | as it is stated: “The hosts of angels will scatter [ yidodun ]” | Shabbat 88b:6 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> From <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God the souls of the Jewish people left</b> their bodies, <b>as it is stated: “My soul departed when he spoke”</b> (Song of Songs 5:6). <b>And since their souls left</b> their bodies <b>from the first utterance, how did they receive the second utterance? </b> Rather, God <b>rained the dew</b> upon them <b>that, in the future, will revive the dead, and He revived them, as it is stated: “You, God, poured down a bountiful rain; when Your inheritance was weary You sustained it”</b> (Psalms 68:10). <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> With <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of God the Jewish people retreated</b> in fear <b>twelve <i>mil</i>, and the ministering angels walked them</b> back toward the mountain, <b>as it is stated: “The hosts of angels will scatter [<i>yidodun</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:13). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>yidodun</i>, </b> meaning scattered; <b>rather, </b> read it as <b><i>yedadun</i>, </b> they walked them. |
| Psalms 68:14 | Because the community of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is written: “The wings of a dove, covered in silver, and its pinions with the shimmer of gold” | Berakhot 53b:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is different</b> about a <b>dove, </b> that he specifically said that that was the object that he forgot? The Talmud answers: <b>Because the community of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is written: “The wings of a dove, covered in silver, and its pinions with the shimmer of gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14). The Talmud explains the parable: <b>Just as a dove is saved</b> from its enemies <b>only by its wings, so too, Israel is saved only by</b> the merit of the <b>mitzvot. </b> |
| Psalms 68:14 | said: The congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated: “You shall shine as the wings of a dove covered with silver | Sanhedrin 95a:9 | The Talmud relates: <b>That day at dusk on Shabbat eve, Abishai ben Zeruiah shampooed his hair with four jugs of water</b> in preparation for Shabbat. <b>He saw four bloodstains. There are</b> those <b>who say: A dove came and fluttered</b> its wings <b>before him. </b> Abishai <b>said: The congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated: “You shall shine as the wings of a dove covered with silver</b> and her pinions with yellow gold” (Psalms 68:14); <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>David, king of Israel, is in a state of distress.

| Psalms 68:14 | the wings of a dove covered with silver | Shabbat 49a:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>doves’ wings from</b> those of <b>other birds</b> that led Elisha to say that he had doves’ wings in his hand? The Talmud answers: <b>Because the congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated: </b> “You shall shine as <b>the wings of a dove covered with silver</b> and her pinions with yellow gold” (Psalms 68:14). <b>Just as this dove, </b> only <b>its wings protect it</b> and it has no other means of protection, <b>so too the Jewish people, </b> only <b>mitzvot protect them. </b> |
| Psalms 68:14 | as it is stated: “When you lie among the sheepfolds, | Sotah 11b:5 | <b>And they would</b> then <b>take</b> what they prepared <b>to their husbands, to the field, and would bathe</b> their husbands <b>and anoint them</b> with oil <b>and feed them</b> the fish <b>and give them to drink and bond with them</b> in sex <b>between the sheepfolds, </b> i.e., between the borders and fences of the fields, <b>as it is stated: “When you lie among the sheepfolds, </b> the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold” (Psalms 68:14), which is interpreted to mean that <b>as a reward</b> for “when you <b>lie among the sheepfolds, ” the Jewish people merited to</b> receive <b>the plunder of Egypt, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse, as a reference to the Jewish people: <b>“The wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14). |

| Psalms 68:17 | which is written: “Why do you look askance [ teratzdun ], O high-peaked mountains, | Megillah 29a:10 | <b>Bar Kappara interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why do you look askance [<i>teratzdun</i>], O high-peaked mountains, </b> at the mountain that God has desired for His abode” (Psalms 68:17)? <b>A bat kol issued forth and said to</b> all the mountains that came and demanded that the Torah be given upon them: <b>Why do you seek [<i>tirtzu</i>]</b> to enter into <b>a legal dispute [<i>din</i>] with</b> Mount <b>Sinai?

| Psalms 68:18 | rides on his light cherub and flies in eighteen thousand worlds, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even [ shinan ] thousands” | Avodah Zarah3b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>And during</b> the twelve hours of <b>the night, what does</b> God <b>do? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the night is <b>similar to the day, </b> i.e., God performs the same activities as in the day. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that He <b>rides on his light cherub and flies in eighteen thousand worlds, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even [<i>shinan</i>] thousands”</b> (Psalms 68:18). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>even [<i>shinan</i>], rather</b> read it as: <b>That which are not [<i>she’einan</i>]. </b> Since the minimum of thousands is two thousand, the phrase: That which are not thousands, indicates that two thousand are not present, i.e., the chariots of God are twenty thousand minus two thousand, which means that God rides in eighteen thousand worlds. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that God <b>sits and listens to the songs from the mouths of the</b> angelic <b>creatures, as it is stated: “By day YHWH will command His loving-kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me”</b> (Psalms 42:9). |
| Psalms 68:19 | and passed something to him, as it is stated: “You ascended on high, you took a captive, you took gifts on account of man, | Shabbat 89a:2 | <b>Immediately, each and every one</b> of the angels <b>became an admirer</b> of Moses <b>and passed something to him, as it is stated: “You ascended on high, you took a captive, you took gifts on account of man, </b> and even among the rebellious also that YHWH God might dwell there” (Psalms 68:19). The meaning of the verse is: <b>In reward for</b> the fact <b>that they called you man, </b> you are not an angel and the Torah is applicable to you, <b>you took gifts</b> from the angels. And <b>even the Angel of Death gave him something, </b> as Moses told Aaron how to stop the plague, <b>as it is stated: “And he placed the incense, and he atoned for the people”</b> (Numbers 17:12). <b>And</b> the verse <b>says: “And he stood between the dead and the living, </b> and the plague was stopped” (Numbers 17:13). <b>If</b> it were <b>not that</b> the Angel of Death <b>told him</b> this remedy, <b>would he have known</b> it? |

| Psalms 68:20 | The verse says: “Blessed is the Lord, day by day” | Berakhot 40a:10 | We learned in the Mishnah that <b>R' Yehuda says</b> that one recites over herbs and leafy greens: <b>Who creates various kinds of herbs.

The question arises: <b>Is it so that one blesses Him by day and does not bless Him at night?

| Psalms 68:20 | he said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give each and every righteous person His handful, as it is stated: “Blessed be the Lord, Who day by day bears our burden; God is our salvation, Selah” | Sanhedrin 100a:15 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: God will give each and every righteous person His handful, as it is stated: “Blessed be YHWH, Who day by day bears our burden; God is our salvation, Selah”</b> (Psalms 68:20). <b>Abaye said to him: And is it possible to say so, </b> that God will give them His handful? <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span, </b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12)? And if the span of God is as great as the heavens, how can a person receive a handful from God? |
| Psalms 68:20 | as it is written: “Blessed is the Lord, day by day” | Sukkah 46a:12 | <b>A baraita states: </b> If <b>one had several mitzvot before him</b> to fulfill, <b>he recites: Blessed…Who has sanctified us with His mitzvot, and commanded us concerning the mitzvot.

| Psalms 68:21 | as it is stated: “Issues [ totzaot ] of death” | Berakhot 8a:12 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The time of finding</b> refers to <b>death. </b> One should pray that when death comes, he will leave the world peacefully, <b>as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death”</b> (Psalms 68:21). Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is based on the etymological similarity between <i>totzaot</i> and <i>matza</i>, finding. |
| Psalms 68:23 | “The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea” | Gittin 57b:12 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says, and some say</b> that it was <b>R' Ami</b> who says this, <b>and some say</b> that <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: </b> There was <b>an incident involving four hundred boys and girls who were taken as captives for</b> the purpose of <b>prostitution. </b> These children <b>sensed on their own what they were expected</b> to do, and <b>they said: If we</b> commit suicide and <b>drown in the sea, </b> will <b>we come to</b> eternal <b>life in the World-to-Come? The oldest</b> child <b>among them expounded</b> the verse: <b>“YHWH said, I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea”</b> (Psalms 68:23). <b>“I will bring back from Bashan, ”</b> i.e., <b>from between the teeth [<i>bein shen</i>] of the lion, </b> and <b>“I will bring them back from the depths of the sea”</b> is referring to <b>those who drown in the sea</b> for the sake of Heaven. |
| Psalms 68:26 | “the singers go before, the minstrels follow after [ aḥar ]” | Nedarim 37b:8 | <b>The ornamentation of the scribes</b> are expressions that the scribes understood in a manner that differs slightly from its plain understanding.

| Psalms 68:27 | from here: “In assemblies [ mak’helot ], bless God, the Lord, from the source of Israel” | Ketubot 7b:3 | § Apropos the source for the benediction of the grooms, the Talmud discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Naḥman said: Huna bar Natan said to me</b> that it was <b>taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the benediction of the grooms</b> is recited <b>in</b> a quorum of <b>ten</b> men? It is <b>as it is stated: “And he took ten men of the Elders of the city and said: Sit you here, </b> and they sat” (Ruth 4:2). <b>And R' Abbahu said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “In assemblies [<i>mak’helot</i>], bless God, YHWH, from the source of Israel”</b> (Psalms 68:27). This verse indicates that a congregation [<i>kahal</i>], which contains at least ten men, blesses God when reciting a benediction related to the source of Israel, i.e., sex, which will lead to the birth of Jewish children. |
| Psalms 68:27 | “In full assemblies, bless God, the Lord, you that are from the source of Israel” | Sotah 31a:1 | <b>“In full assemblies, bless God, YHWH, you that are from the source of Israel”</b> (Psalms 68:27), indicating that even children that are in the “source,” i.e., their mother’s womb, blessed God when they gathered at the sea. |

The Messiah <b>will think</b> it appropriate <b>not to accept</b> gifts <b>from them, </b> as the Egyptians abused Israel. <b>God, </b> will <b>say to the Messiah: Accept</b> their gifts <b>from them, </b> as <b>they granted lodging to My children in Egypt. </b> They lived there for many years before being enslaved. <b>Immediately, “Nobles shall come out of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 68:32). |

| Psalms 68:31 | Rebuke the beast, all of whose actions are written with a single quill. | Pesachim 118b:16 | <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that the verse means: <b>Rebuke the beast, all of whose actions are written with a single quill. </b> <i>Kaneh</i> can mean a reed, or a quill. In other words, rebuke a nation that speaks of others in only one manner, for the worse. The verse continues: “The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, everyone submitting himself with pieces of silver. He has scattered the peoples who delight in war” (Psalms 68:31). <b>“The multitude of the bulls [<i>abirim</i>], with the calves of the peoples”; </b> this is referring to Rome, <b>who slaughtered mighty people [<i>abirim</i>] like ownerless calves. </b> |

| Psalms 68:36 | which is written: “Awesome is God out of your holy places” | Zevachim 115b:15 | <b>And this is what R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Awesome is God out of your holy places”</b> (Psalms 68:36)? <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“From your holy places [<i>mimikdashekha</i>]”; rather, </b> read it as: <b>From your holy ones [<i>mimekudashekha</i>].

In any event, there is no contradiction from the <i>baraita</i> which teaches that the first-born performed the sacrificial service before the Tabernacle was established, as this matter is the subject of a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>. |
| Psalms 69:10 | Doeg the Edomite was jealous of David, as it is written: “Because jealousy for Your House has eaten me up” | Zevachim 54b:8 | <b>And with regard to this matter, </b> that David and Samuel discovered the location of the Temple, <b>Doeg the Edomite was jealous of David, as it is written: “Because jealousy for Your House has eaten me up”</b> (Psalms 69:10), <b>and it is written: “Lord, remember for David all his affliction; how he swore to YHWH, </b> and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: <b>I will not come into the tent of my house, </b> nor go up into the bed that is spread for me; <b>if I will give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids; until I find a place for YHWH, </b> a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob” (Psalms 132:1–5). |
| Psalms 69:14 | that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor; | Berakhot 8a:1 | <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor; </b> O God, in the abundance of Your mercy, answer me with the truth of Your salvation” (Psalms 69:14)? It appears that the individual is praying that his prayers will coincide with a special time of Divine favor. <b>When is a time of favor? </b> It is <b>at the time when the congregation is praying. </b> It is beneficial to pray together with the congregation, for God does not fail to respond to the entreaties of the congregation. |
| Psalms 69:22 | “They put gall into my food, | Chullin 87a:7 | The heretic <b>said to</b> R' Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Give me three days’ time and I will respond to you</b> with <b>a rebuttal</b> of your claim. <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat</b> and fasted <b>three</b> days of <b>fasting</b> while awaiting the heretic, in order that he would not find a rebuttal. <b>When</b> R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>wanted to have a meal</b> at the conclusion of those three days, <b>they said to him: </b> That <b>heretic is standing at the doorway. </b> R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>recited</b> the following verse about himself: <b>“They put gall into my food, </b> and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink” (Psalms 69:22), i.e., my meal is embittered with the presence of this heretic. |
| Psalms 69:23 | Rabbi Elazar says: She hid a snare for him, as it is stated: “Let their table become a snare before them” | Megillah 15b:12 | The verse states that Esther requested: “If it seem good unto the king, <b>let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet</b> that I have prepared for him” (Esther 5:4). <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did Esther see to invite Haman</b> to the banquet? <b>R' Elazar says: She hid a snare for him, as it is stated: “Let their table become a snare before them”</b> (Psalms 69:23), as she assumed that she would be able to trip up Haman during the banquet. |
| Psalms 69:29 | “Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, but not be written with the righteous” | Rosh Hashanah16b:13 | <b>R' Avin said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, but not be written with the righteous”</b> (Psalms 69:29). <b>“Let them be blotted out of the book”; this is the book of wholly wicked</b> people, who are blotted out from the world. <b>“Of the living”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>righteous</b> people. <b>“But not be written with the righteous”; this is the book of middling</b> people, who are written in a separate book, not with the righteous. |
| Psalms 69:32 | as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns and hoofs” | Avodah Zarah8a:10 | <b>A baraita states: </b> On <b>the day that Adam the first</b> man <b>was created, when the sun set upon him he said: Woe</b> is <b>me, as because I sinned, the world is becoming dark around me, and the world will return to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven. He spent all night fasting and crying, and Eve was crying opposite him. Once dawn broke, he said: </b> Evidently, the sun sets and night arrives, and <b>this is the order of the world. He arose and sacrificed a bull whose horns preceded its hoofs</b> in the order that they were created, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall please YHWH better than a bullock that has horns and hoofs”</b> (Psalms 69:32). This verse is referring to the one particular bull whose horns preceded its hoofs. |
| Psalms 69:32 | had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns [ makrin ] and hoofs” | Chullin 60a:7 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says: </b> The <b>bull that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed</b> as a thanks offering for his life being spared <b>had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please YHWH better than a bullock that has horns [<i>makrin</i>] and hoofs”</b> (Psalms 69:32). The Talmud comments: On the contrary, the word <b><i>makrin</i> indicates two</b> horns. <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> Although it is vocalized in the plural, <b><i>makran</i> is written</b> in the verse, without the letter <i>yod</i>, to indicate that it had only a single horn. |
| Psalms 69:32 | of a cow are also called shofar , as it is written: “And it shall please the Lord better than an ox bull [ shor par ] | Rosh Hashanah26a:5 | <b>And</b> how would <b>R' Yosei</b> counter this argument? <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you: </b> The horns <b>of a cow are also called <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “And it shall please YHWH better than an ox bull [<i>shor par</i>]</b> that has horns and hoofs” (Psalms 69:32). The wording of the verse is strange: <b>If</b> it is <b>an ox [<i>shor</i>], why</b> is it also called <b>a bull [<i>par</i>], and if</b> it is <b>a bull [<i>par</i>], why</b> is it called <b>an ox [<i>shor</i>]? Rather, what is</b> the meaning of <b><i>shor par</i>? </b> These two words must be read as if they were one single word: <b>Than a <i>shofar</i>. </b> According to this reading, even the horn of a cow is called a <i>shofar</i>. |
| Psalms 69:32 | had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a horned [ makrin ] and hooved ox” | Shabbat 28b:7 | The Talmud comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is said</b> that the <i>taḥash</i> <b>had a single horn on its forehead, conclude from this</b> that it was kosher, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> in a similar vein: The <b>ox that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed</b> as a thanks-offering for his life being spared, <b>had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please YHWH better than a horned [<i>makrin</i>] and hooved ox”</b> (Psalms 69:32). The word <i>makrin</i> means one with a horn. The Talmud asks: On the contrary, <b><i>makrin</i> indicates</b> that it has <b>two</b> horns. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> Despite the fact that it is vocalized in the plural, <b>it is written <i>mikeren</i></b> without the letter <i>yod</i> to indicate that it had only a single horn. The Talmud asks: If so, <b>let us resolve from</b> the same <i>baraita</i> that just as it was derived from the ox of Adam, the first man, that an animal with one horn is kosher, derive that an animal with one horn <b>is a type of domesticated animal. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Since there is</b> the <b><i>keresh</i> which is a type of undomesticated animal, and it has only a single horn, it</b> is also possible <b>to say</b> that the <i>taḥash</i> is <b>a type of undomesticated animal. </b> This dilemma was not resolved. |
| Psalms 71:4 | “My God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and grasping man [ ḥometz ]” | Kiddushin 53a:10 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: What is the verse</b> from which is derived that <i>ḥamtzan</i> means one who snatches? The verse states: <b>“My God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and grasping man [<i>ḥometz</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:4). <b>Rabba said: </b> It is derived <b>from here: “Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17), i.e., restore property stolen from victims of theft. |
| Psalms 71:4 | “O, my God, rescue me out of the hand of wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and robbing man [ ḥometz ]” | Yoma 39b:2 | <b>Rabba bar bar Sheila said: What is the verse</b> that indicates that a <i>ḥamtzan</i> is a robber? The verse states: <b>“O, my God, rescue me out of the hand of wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and robbing man [<i>ḥometz</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:4). <b>Rava said: From here: “Learn to do well, seek justice, strengthen the robbed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17), which teaches that one should <b>strengthen the robbed, but not strengthen the robber. </b> |
| Psalms 71:6 | You are He Who took me out [ gozi ] of my mother’s womb” | Niddah 31a:1 | <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus is administered an oath on the day of its birth? “Upon You I have relied from birth; <b>You are He Who took me out [<i>gozi</i>] of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word: <b>“<i>Gozi</i>, ” is a term of administering an oath? As it is written: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29), which is interpreted as a reference to the vow of a nazirite, who must cut off his hair at the end of his term of naziriteship. |
| Psalms 71:6 | states: “Out of my mother’s womb You pulled me [ gozi ]” | Sotah 45b:16 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Shall we say that these <i>tanna’im</i> are like those <i>tanna’im</i>, </b> who had a dispute as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where is an embryo formed? From its head, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Out of my mother’s womb You pulled me [<i>gozi</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>And</b> the proof that “<i>gozi</i>” is referring to the head is from the verse that <b>states: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair, and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29). In this verse, the term <i>gozi</i> relates to the hair of the head. <b>Abba Shaul says: </b> An embryo is formed <b>from its navel, and it sends its roots forth. </b> This dispute concerning the initial formation of an embryo also appears to depend on where the main source of life in a person is. |
| Psalms 71:6 | from its head, as it is stated: “You are He Who took me [ gozi ] out of my mother’s womb” | Yoma 85a:10 | The Talmud comments: <b>Let us say that</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree about checking for signs of life <b>is like</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree about the formation of the fetus. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From what point is the fetus created? </b> It is <b>from its head, as it is stated: “You are He Who took me [<i>gozi</i>] out of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6), <b>and it says: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair, and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29). These verses suggest that one is created from the head, the place of the hair. <b>Abba Shaul says: </b> A person is created <b>from his navel, and he sends his roots in every direction</b> until he attains the image of a person. The <i>tanna</i> who says that the presence of life is determined based on the nose holds in accordance with the opinion of the <i>tanna</i> who maintains that the formation of a fetus begins with its head. Likewise, the <i>tanna</i> who says the presence of life is determined based on the heart holds in accordance with the opinion of the one who thinks the formation of a fetus begins with its navel. |
| Psalms 71:8 | because it is stated: “My mouth will be filled with Your praise” | Berakhot 51a:1 | The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to a</b> food <b>item that does not become disgusting as well, let him shift it to the side and recite the blessing. </b> Why need he spit it out? <b>Rav Yitzḥak Kaskesa’a explained before R' Yosei bar Avin, in the name of R' Yoḥanan: </b> One spits it out <b>because it is stated: “My mouth will be filled with Your praise”</b> (Psalms 71:8), meaning that one should recite God’s praises with his entire mouth, not merely half. |
| Psalms 72:5 | “Let them fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation after generation” | Berakhot 29b:9 | The brothers, <b>Abaye bar Avin and R' Ḥanina bar Avin, both said: </b> One whose prayer is fixed refers to <b>anyone who does not</b> make the effort to <b>pray with the reddening of the sun, </b> just after sunrise and just before sunset, which are auspicious times for prayer. As <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: It is a mitzva to pray with the reddening of the sun. And R' Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Let them fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation after generation”</b> (Psalms 72:5). Prayer, the manifestation of the fear of God, should be undertaken adjacent to sunrise and sunset. Nevertheless, <b>in the West, </b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they cursed one who prays with the reddening of the sun</b>, adjacent to sunset. <b>What is the reason? Perhaps, </b> due to preoccupation, he will become <b>confused about the hour</b> and the time for prayer will pass. |
| Psalms 72:5 | “They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon for all generations” | Berakhot 9b:15 | Regarding this custom of the <i>vatikin</i>, <b>R' Zeira said: What verse</b> is the source for this tradition? <b>“They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon for all generations”</b> (Psalms 72:5). This verse indicates that one should express one’s awe of Heaven, they shall fear You, immediately before sunrise, with the sun. |
| Psalms 72:5 | three generations, as it is stated: “May they fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout the generations [ dor dorim ]” | Sanhedrin 99a:3 | <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The messianic era will last <b>three generations, as it is stated: “May they fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout the generations [<i>dor dorim</i>]”</b> (Psalms 72:5). <i>Dor</i> is singular and <i>dorim</i> is plural, for a total of three generations. <b>R' Hillel says: There is no Messiah</b> coming <b>for the Jewish people, as they already ate</b> from <b>him, </b> as all the prophecies relating to the Messiah were already fulfilled, <b>during the days of Hezekiah. </b> |
| Psalms 72:5 | “They will fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation upon generation” | Shabbat 118b:6 | And furthermore, <b>R' Yosei said: May my portion be among those who pray</b> the morning and afternoon prayers <b>with the reddening of the sun, </b> i.e., the morning prayer at sunrise and the afternoon prayer adjacent to nightfall. <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: It is a mitzva to pray with the reddening of the sun. R' Zeira said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“They will fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation upon generation”</b> (Psalms 72:5). Fear of God, prayer, should be with the sun and before the moon. |
| Psalms 72:16 | as it is stated: “Let abundant [ pissat ] grain [ bar ] be in the land” | Ketubot 111b:11 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Yosef</b> further <b>said: In the future Eretz Yisrael will produce cakes [<i>geluskaot</i>] and</b> fine <b>wool clothing [<i>meilat</i>]</b> that will grow from the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Let abundant [<i>pissat</i>] grain [<i>bar</i>] be in the land”</b> (Psalms 72:16). The term <i>pissat</i> is interpreted in a similar manner to <i>ketonet passim</i>, Joseph’s valuable clothing of many colors, while <i>bar</i> can mean bread. |
| Psalms 72:16 | “Let abundant [ pissat ] grain be in the land upon the top of the mountains” | Ketubot 111b:12 | § <b>A baraita states</b> the following with regard to the verse <b>“Let abundant [<i>pissat</i>] grain be in the land upon the top of the mountains”</b> (Psalms 72:16). <b>They said: In the future, wheat will rise up, and grow</b> tall <b>like a palm tree, and ascend to the top of the mountains. And lest you say</b> that if wheat will grow this tall <b>its reaper</b> will suffer <b>discomfort, the</b> same <b>verse states: “May his fruit rustle like Lebanon. ” God, </b> will <b>bring a wind from His treasury and blow across, and</b> this will thereby <b>induce the flour</b> to fall from the stalks of wheat, <b>and a person will go out to the field and bring back a palmful [<i>pissat</i>]</b> of flour, <b>from which he will</b> provide <b>his livelihood and the livelihood of the members of his household. </b> |
| Psalms 72:16 | the righteous will burst forth and arise in Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And may they blossom out of the city like the grass of the earth” | Ketubot 111b:9 | § <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: In the future, </b> at the time of the resurrection of the dead, <b>the righteous will burst forth and arise in Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And may they blossom out of the city like the grass of the earth”</b> (Psalms 72:16), <b>and</b> the term <b>“city”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Jerusalem, as it is stated: “For I will defend this city”</b> (II Kings 19:34). |
| Psalms 72:16 | She said: I know that the dead will live, as it is written: “And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth” | Sanhedrin 90b:20 | § The Talmud relates: <b>Queen Cleopatra asked R' Meir</b> a question. <b>She said: I know that the dead will live, as it is written: “And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth”</b> (Psalms 72:16). Just as grass grows, so too, the dead will come to life. <b>But when they arise, </b> will they <b>arise naked or</b> will <b>they arise with their garments? </b> R' Meir <b>said to her: </b> It is derived <b><i>a fortiori</i> from wheat. If wheat, which is buried naked, </b> meaning that the kernel is sown without the chaff, <b>emerges with several garments</b> of chaff, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>the righteous, who are buried with their garments, </b> arise with their garments. |
| Psalms 72:16 | would fall, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” | Yoma 21b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And are there no more</b> miracles performed in the Temple? <b>But didn’t Rav Oshaya say: When Solomon built the Temple he planted all sorts of precious golden fruits there, and</b> these <b>brought forth their fruit in their</b> appointed <b>season</b> like other trees, <b>and when the wind blew them</b> the fruit <b>would fall, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 72:16). This indicates that fruits grew in Lebanon, which the rabbis interpreted as a reference to the Temple, which was built with cedar trees from Lebanon. <b>And when the non-Jews entered the Sanctuary</b> the golden tree <b>withered, as it stated: “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither”</b> (Nahum 1:4). <b>And God will restore the</b> miraculous trees to Israel <b>in the future, as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it”</b> (Isaiah 35:2). Apparently, there were additional miracles in the Temple. |
| Psalms 72:16 | brought forth fruit in their season. And when the wind blew upon them, their fruit would fall off, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” | Yoma 39b:8 | <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviya said: Why is</b> the Temple <b>called: Forest, as it is written: “The house of the forest of Lebanon”</b> (I Kings 10:17)? <b>To tell you: Just as a forest blooms, so too the Temple blooms. As Rav Hoshaya said: When Solomon built the Temple, he planted in it all kinds of sweet fruit</b> trees made <b>of gold, and</b> miraculously these <b>brought forth fruit in their season. And when the wind blew upon them, their fruit would fall off, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 72:16). <b>And through</b> selling these golden fruits to the public, <b>there was a source of income for the priesthood. </b> |
| Psalms 72:17 | “May his name endure forever; | Nedarim 39b:11 | <b>The name of the Messiah</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written</b> about him: <b>“May his name endure forever; </b> his name existed before the sun” (Psalms 72:17). The name of the Messiah predated the creation of the sun and the rest of the world. Apparently, Rava’s explanation that Moses was uncertain whether Gehenna had been created yet is contradicted by this <i>baraita</i>. |
| Psalms 72:17 | “May his name endure forever; his name existed before the sun” | Pesachim 54a:11 | <b>The Throne of Glory and the Temple</b> were created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning, in the place of our Sanctuary”</b> (Jeremiah 17:12). <b>The name of Messiah</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written</b> in the chapter discussing the Messiah: <b>“May his name endure forever; his name existed before the sun”</b> (Psalms 72:17). The name of Messiah already existed before the creation of the sun and the rest of the world. This <i>baraita</i> states that Gehenna was created before the world was created and not during twilight before the first Shabbat. |
| Psalms 72:17 | The school of Rabbi Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [ yinnon ] as long as the sun; | Sanhedrin 98b:14 | Apropos the Messiah, the Talmud asks: <b>What is his name? The school of R' Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come”</b> (Genesis 49:10). <b>The school of R' Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [<i>yinnon</i>] as long as the sun; </b> and may men bless themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). <b>The school of R' Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [<i>ḥanina</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 16:13). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>] that should relieve my soul is far from me”</b> (Lamentations 1:16). <b>And the Rabbis say: The metzora of the house of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 53:4). |
| Psalms 72:20 | Rabbi Meir would say: All the praises stated in the book of Psalms were recited by David, as it is stated: “The prayers of David, son of Yishai, are ended [ kalu ]” | Pesachim 117a:8 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Meir would say: All the praises stated in the book of Psalms were recited by David, as it is stated: “The prayers of David, son of Yishai, are ended [<i>kalu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 72:20). <b>Do not read <i>kalu</i>; rather, </b> read <b><i>kol elu</i>, all of these, </b> which indicates that the entire book of Psalms consists of the prayers of King David. |
| Psalms 73:4 | that which is written: “For there are no pangs [ ḥartzubot ] at their death and their body is sound” | Shabbat 31b:5 | <b>Rava bar Rav Ulla taught: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For there are no pangs [<i>ḥartzubot</i>] at their death and their body is sound”</b> (Psalms 73:4)? <b>God said: Is it not enough for wicked people that they are not anxious [<i>ḥared</i>] or sad [<i>atzuv</i>], </b> <i>ḥartzubot</i> is an acronym of <i>ḥared</i> and <i>atzuv</i>, in anticipation <b>of the day of</b> their <b>death, but</b> also, <b>their heart is as unyielding for them as</b> the entrance to a <b>hall</b> is wide, and they devote no thought to it. <b>And that is</b> what <b>Rabba said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “This is the way of them that are foolish</b> and of those who after them speak approvingly, Selah” (Psalms 49:14)? It means that the <b>wicked know that their path</b> leads <b>to</b> eternal <b>death, </b> but <b>they have fat on their kidneys</b> that prevents that realization from entering their hearts. <b>Lest you say that it is</b> simply <b>forgotten from them; </b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And of those who after them speak approvingly, Selah”</b> (Psalms 49:14). They are aware of their fate and speak of it, but it does not affect them. |
| Psalms 73:7 | Rav says: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei? As it is written: “Their eyes stand forth from fatness” | Bekhorot 38b:9 | <b>Rav says: What is the reason of R' Yosei? As it is written: “Their eyes stand forth from fatness”</b> (Psalms 73:7), which is interpreted to mean that the wicked embark on an evil path due to the fatness in the eyes, which is in the white portion. This indicates that the white portion <b>is called the fat of the eye, </b> but <b>it is not called simply: Their eyes. </b> Conversely, a <i>tevallul</i> is considered a blemish only if it is in the eye itself, as it states: “Or <i>tevallul</i> in his eye” (Leviticus 21:20). The Talmud further asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>R' Meir, what is his reason? </b> The Talmud answers that R' Meir would explain as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the <b>expression <i>tevallul</i>? </b> It is <b>a substance that mixes [<i>hamevalbel</i>]</b> within <b>the eyes, </b> i.e., which passes through the white and the black in any fashion. |
| Psalms 73:9 | sins until the heavens, as it is stated: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth” | Arakhin 15b:11 | <b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech increases</b> his <b>sins until the heavens, as it is stated: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth”</b> (Psalms 73:9). In other words, while his tongue walks on the earth, his sin reaches the heavens. |
| Psalms 73:9 | the verse teaches: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth” | Arakhin 15b:23 | <b>If</b> you say that <b>just as an arrow</b> can kill only within the distance it can be shot, which is <b>up to</b> about <b>forty or fifty cubits, so too a tongue</b> can kill only from <b>up to forty or fifty cubits, </b> therefore <b>the verse teaches: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth”</b> (Psalms 73:9). This teaches that malicious speech can reach great distances, even the distance between heaven and earth. |
| Psalms 73:9 | But since it is written: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, | Arakhin 15b:24 | The Talmud asks: <b>But since it is written: “They have set their mouth against the heavens, </b> and their tongue walks through the earth” (Psalms 73:9), which teaches that malicious speech reaches between heaven and earth, <b>why do I</b> need that which we derived from the verse: <b>“Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), i.e. that a tongue can kill from the distance an arrow flies? The Talmud answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> a tongue <b>kills</b> in the <b>same</b> manner that <b>an arrow</b> kills. |
| Psalms 73:17 | “Until I entered into the sanctuary [ mikdashei ] of God, and considered [ avina ] their end” | Bava Metzia86a:2 | <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember that Rav Ashi and Ravina redacted the Talmud is the verse: <b>“Until I entered into the sanctuary [<i>mikdashei</i>] of God, and considered [<i>avina</i>] their end”</b> (Psalms 73:17). The sanctuary, <i>mikdashei</i>, alludes to Rav Ashi, while the term <i>avina</i> alludes to Ravina, which is a contraction of Rav Avina. The phrase: Their end, is interpreted as a reference to the redacting of the Talmud. |
| Psalms 73:27 | as it is stated: “Those that go far from You shall perish; You destroy [ hitzmatta ] all those who go astray from You” | Sanhedrin 106b:16 | <b>R' Ami says: Doeg died only when he forgot what he learned, as it is stated: “He shall die for want of instruction, and in his folly he shall go astray”</b> (Proverbs 5:23). <b>Rav Ashi says: He was afflicted with tzara'at</b> before his death, <b>as it is stated: “Those that go far from You shall perish; You destroy [<i>hitzmatta</i>] all those who go astray from You”</b> (Psalms 73:27). |
| Psalms 74:4 | As it is stated: “Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; they have set up their own signs for signs” | Gittin 56b:9 | <b>What did</b> Titus <b>do</b> when he conquered the Temple? <b>He took a prostitute with his hand, and entered the Holy of Holies</b> with her. <b>He</b> then <b>spread out a Torah scroll</b> underneath him <b>and committed a sin, </b> i.e., had sex, <b>on it. </b> Afterward <b>he took a sword and cut into the curtain</b> separating between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies. <b>And a miracle was performed and blood spurted forth. </b> Seeing the blood, <b>he</b> mistakenly <b>thought</b> that <b>he had killed himself. </b> Here, the term himself is a euphemism for God. Titus saw blood issuing forth from the curtain in God’s meeting place, the Temple, and he took it as a sign that he had succeeded in killing God Himself. <b>As it is stated: “Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; they have set up their own signs for signs”</b> (Psalms 74:4). |
| Psalms 74:5 | and it opened, as it is stated: “He became known as the wielder of axes upward in a thicket of trees” | Sanhedrin 96b:3 | A Divine <b>Voice emerged and said: Leaper, son of a leaper; Nebuzaradan, take</b> the <b>leap, as the time has arrived for the Temple to be destroyed and the Sanctuary to burn. One ax remained for him</b> to use. <b>He went and struck</b> the gate <b>with the dull end</b> of the ax <b>and it opened, as it is stated: “He became known as the wielder of axes upward in a thicket of trees”</b> (Psalms 74:5). At the appropriate time the gate was breached as though the ax were cutting trees. |
| Psalms 74:6 | one gate of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And now they pound its carved work together with hatchet and with hammers” | Sanhedrin 96b:2 | § The Talmud proceeds to discuss the role of Nebuzaradan in the destruction of the Temple. <b>Rava says: Nebuchadnezzar sent to Nebuzaradan three hundred mules laden with iron axes that cut iron. All of them were incapacitated</b> in the attempt to breach <b>one gate of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And now they pound its carved work together with hatchet and with hammers”</b> (Psalms 74:6). Nebuzaradan <b>sought to return</b> to Babylonia and <b>said: I am afraid. </b> I want to ensure <b>that they will not do to me just as they did to Sennacherib, </b> whose downfall was in Jerusalem. |
| Psalms 74:11 | states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [ yadkha ], even Your right hand [ viminekha ]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them” | Menachot 36b:11 | § <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: “And it shall be for a sign for you on <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>left</b> arm. <b>Do you say</b> it means the <b>left</b> arm, <b>or is it only</b> the <b>right</b> arm? <b>The verse states: “Even My hand [<i>yadi</i>] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [<i>vimini</i>] has spread out the heavens”</b> (Isaiah 48:13). <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “Her hand [<i>yadah</i>] she put to the tent pin, and her right hand [<i>viminah</i>] to the workmen’s hammer”</b> (Judges 5:26), <b>and</b> another verse <b>states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [<i>yadkha</i>], even Your right hand [<i>viminekha</i>]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them”</b> (Psalms 74:11). All these verses employ the term <i>yad</i> with regard to the left hand, and use the term <i>yamin</i>, literally, right, without the term <i>yad</i>, to indicate the right hand. |
| Psalms 75:11 | of the righteous will be exalted, as it is written: “All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted” | Megillah 17b:18 | <b>And once the heretics cease to be, the horn, </b> i.e., the glory, <b>of the righteous will be exalted, as it is written: “All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted”</b> (Psalms 75:11). Therefore, after the blessing of the heretics, one says the blessing about the righteous. <b>And he includes the righteous converts along with the righteous, as it is stated: “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the elder”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), <b>and adjacent to this</b> it is stated: <b>“And if a stranger sojourns with you”</b> (Leviticus 19:33). An “elder” is one with Torah wisdom and a “stranger” is one who has converted to Judaism. |
| Psalms 76:9 | which is written: “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was silent” | Avodah Zarah3a:7 | <b>And this is</b> similar to <b>that which Ḥizkiyya says</b> with regard to a different matter: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was silent”</b> (Psalms 76:9)? <b>If</b> the earth <b>feared, why was it silent, and if it was silent, why did it fear? </b> One who is afraid does not stay silent, and one who remains silent thereby demonstrates that he is not afraid. <b>Rather, </b> this is the meaning of the verse: <b>At first, </b> when God came to give the Torah to the Jewish people, the earth <b>feared</b> that they might not accept it, and it would be destroyed. This is alluded to by the phrase “You caused sentence to be heard. ” <b>But ultimately, </b> when the Jews accepted the Torah, the earth <b>was silent. </b> Consequently, heaven and earth are interested parties and cannot testify about the Jewish people’s commitment to the Torah. |
| Psalms 76:9 | which is written: “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was silent” | Shabbat 88a:6 | <b>Ḥizkiya said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was silent”</b> (Psalms 76:9)? <b>If it was afraid, why was it silent; and if it was silent, why was it afraid? Rather, </b> the meaning is: <b>At first, it was afraid, and in the end, it was silent. </b> “You caused sentence to be heard from heaven” refers to the revelation at Sinai. <b>And why was</b> the earth <b>afraid? </b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the 6th day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? <b>Why do I require the superfluous</b> letter <b><i>heh</i>, </b> the definite article, which does not appear on any of the other days? It <b>teaches that God established a condition with the act of Creation, and said to them: If Israel accepts the Torah</b> on the 6th day of Sivan, <b>you will exist; and if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder. </b> Therefore, the earth was afraid until the Torah was given to Israel, lest it be returned to a state of chaos. Once the Jewish people accepted the Torah, the earth was calmed. |
| Psalms 77:16 | from here: “You have with Your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph, Selah” | Sanhedrin 19b:16 | <b>R' Elazar says: </b> Proof for the aforementioned statement can be derived <b>from here: “You have with Your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph, Selah”</b> (Psalms 77:16). <b>And did Joseph sire</b> all of the children of Israel? <b>But didn’t Jacob sire them? Rather, Jacob sired</b> them <b>and Joseph sustained</b> them financially. <b>Therefore, they were called by his name; </b> all of Israel were called the children of Joseph. |
| Psalms 77:19 | as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook” | Berakhot 59a:7 | We <b>also</b> learned in the Mishnah that <b>over thunder</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> causes <b>thunder? Shmuel said: </b> When the <b>clouds</b> located <b>in the curvature</b> of the firmament collide with the firmament itself, they produce this sound, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook”</b> (Psalms 77:19). <b>And the Rabbis say: </b> Thunder is the sound of <b>clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </b> Thunder is caused by <b>a powerful lightning bolt that flashes in the cloud and shatters the hailstones. Rav Ashi said: </b> Because the <b>clouds are hollow, and</b> when <b>the wind comes and blows across their mouths, </b> it sounds like <b>wind blowing in the mouth of a jug. </b> The Talmud concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; as lightning flashes, the clouds rumble, and the rain comes. </b> |
| Psalms 78:23 | Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i derived “opening” | Yoma 76a:10 | The Talmud asks how R' Elazar HaModa’i can compare the depth of the Flood waters with the amount of manna that fell in the desert: <b>This is not similar, </b> and the calculation is inaccurate. <b>There, </b> in the case of the Flood, the water rose fifteen cubits in <b>forty days; </b> but <b>here, </b> in the case of the manna, it took only <b>one hour</b> every day to fall. Conversely, <b>there</b> the Flood was <b>for everyone</b> and covered the whole world; whereas <b>here</b> the manna <b>was for the Jewish people alone. And there</b> would be <b>much more</b> manna <b>for them</b> than sixty cubits, which is the measurement put forth by R' Elazar HaModa’i. The Talmud answers: <b>R' Elazar HaModa’i derived “opening”</b> in the verse: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven” (Psalms 78:23), from <b>“opening”</b> in the verse: “And the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11). He used a verbal analogy that teaches that the skies opened in both instances in the same way. |
| Psalms 78:25 | Alternatively, “Man [ ish ] did eat the bread of the mighty” | Yoma 75b:17 | <b>Alternatively, “Man [<i>ish</i>] did eat the bread of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 78:25); |
| Psalms 78:27 | “And he rained meat upon them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas” | Yoma 75b:3 | The verse states: <b>“And they spread them [<i>vayishteḥu</i>]</b> out for themselves round about the camp” (Numbers 11:32). <b>Reish Lakish said: Do not read it</b> as <b><i>vayishteḥu</i>. Rather, </b> read it as <b><i>vayishḥatu</i>. </b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>enemies of the Jewish people, </b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>were liable to</b> receive the punishment of <b>slaughter</b> due to their demand. The verse states: <b>“Spread out [<i>shato’aḥ</i>]”</b> (Numbers 11:32). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught in the name of R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa: Do not read it</b> as <b><i>shato’aḥ</i> but</b> as <b><i>shaḥot</i>. </b> This <b>teaches that</b> other food <b>fell for the Jewish people</b> along <b>with the manna. </b> The food was something <b>that requires ritual slaughtering [<i>sheḥita</i>], </b> referring to birds. <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: And do you learn</b> this <b>from here? </b> Do we need to alter the word for this purpose? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> explicitly: <b>“And he rained meat upon them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas”</b> (Psalms 78:27)? |
| Psalms 78:38 | “But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity” | Kiddushin 30a:11 | <b>Therefore, </b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> rabbis <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>], </b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll. </b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses. </b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms, </b> with regard to its number of letters. The verse: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity”</b> (Psalms 78:38), <b>is the midpoint</b> of <b>verses</b> in the book of Psalms. |
| Psalms 78:38 | “And He is merciful and shall atone for transgression, and destroys not; | Makkot 22b:12 | <b>And the</b> attendant <b>flogging</b> the one receiving lashes <b>flogs [<i>makeh</i>] him with one hand with all his strength, and the</b> court <b>crier recites</b> the verses: <b>“If you do not observe to perform</b> all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, YHWH your God. <b>And YHWH will make your plagues [<i>makkotekha</i>] outstanding, and the plagues</b> of your descendants, and even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:58–59). <b>And</b> then <b>he returns to the beginning of the verse. </b> He also recites: <b>“And you shall observe the matters of this covenant, </b> and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper” (Deuteronomy 29:8), <b>and concludes</b> with the verse: <b>“And He is merciful and shall atone for transgression, and destroys not; </b> and many a time does He turn His anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath” (Psalms 78:38), <b>and</b> then <b>returns to the beginning of the verse</b> that starts: “If you do not observe to perform. ” |
| Psalms 78:38 | “But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity, | Taanit 8a:12 | <b>R' Ami said: A person’s prayer is heard only if he places his soul in his palm, </b> i.e., one must submit his entire soul with sincerity in his outstretched hands as he prays, <b>as it is stated: “Let us lift up our heart with our hands”</b> (Lamentations 3:41). The Talmud raises an objection: <b>Is that so? But Shmuel</b> once <b>established for himself an interpreter</b> to teach in public, <b>and interpreted homiletically</b> the verse: <b>“But they beguiled Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue, for their heart was not steadfast with Him, neither were they faithful to His covenant”</b> (Psalms 78:36–37), <b>and nevertheless</b> the psalm continues: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity, </b> and does not destroy” (Psalms 78:38). This indicates that all prayers are accepted, even if they lack sincerity. |
| Psalms 78:39 | for example: “So He remembered that they were but flesh, | Rosh Hashanah32b:2 | Similarly, verses of <b>remembrance</b> that speak of a punishment may not be used in Rosh HaShana prayers, <b>for example: “So He remembered that they were but flesh, </b> a wind that passes away, and does not come again” (Psalms 78:39). Nor verses of <b><i>shofar</i>, </b> which refer to calamity, <b>for example: “Sound the <i>shofar</i> in Giva, </b> and the trumpet in Rama; sound an alarm at Beit Aven, behind you, O Benjamin” (Hosea 5:8). |
| Psalms 78:54 | to this mountain, which His right hand had acquired” | Pesachim 87b:6 | The Talmud proceeds to enumerate all four: <b>Torah is one acquisition, as it is written: “YHWH acquired me as the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). <b>Heaven and earth are one acquisition [<i>kinyan</i>], as it is written: </b> “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, <b>Creator [<i>koneh</i>] of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:19). <b>The Holy Temple is one acquisition, as it is written: </b> “And He brought them to His sacred border, <b>to this mountain, which His right hand had acquired”</b> (Psalms 78:54). <b>The Jewish people are one acquisition, as it is written: “The nation that You have acquired”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>And you, </b> Hosea, <b>said</b> that I should <b>replace them with another nation? </b> |
| Psalms 78:60 | and one verse states: “And He forsook the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent that He had made to dwell among men” | Zevachim 118a:13 | § The Mishnah teaches that when <b>they arrived at Shiloh, </b> private altars were prohibited. There was no roof of wood or stone in the Tabernacle in Shiloh; there was only a building of stone below, and the curtains of the roof of the Tabernacle were spread above it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: One verse states, </b> with regard to Hannah bringing Samuel to the Tabernacle: <b>“And she brought him to the house of YHWH in Shiloh”</b> (I Samuel 1:24), <b>and one verse states: “And He forsook the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent that He had made to dwell among men”</b> (Psalms 78:60). <b>And</b> in addition, <b>it is written: “Moreover he abhorred the tent of Joseph and chose not the tribe of Ephraim”</b> (Psalms 78:67). |
| Psalms 78:60 | “And He forsook the Tabernacle of Shiloh” | Zevachim 118b:7 | The Talmud relates that <b>when Abaye went</b> to study Torah with Rav Yosef, <b>he said</b> the statement of Rav Dimi <b>before Rav Yosef. </b> Rav Yosef <b>said</b> in response: <b>Kaylil, </b> Abaye’s father, <b>had one son, and he is not proper.

These verses indicate that the Tabernacle in Shiloh was in the portion of Joseph, not of Benjamin. |
| Psalms 78:65 | “Awaked as one asleep” | Zevachim 31a:3 | § <b>It was stated: </b> If one had intent to eat <b>half an olive-</b>bulk <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, half an olive-</b>bulk <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, and</b> another <b>half an olive-</b>bulk <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, Rava says: </b> In such a case, <b>the <i>piggul</i></b>: <b>“Awaked as one asleep”</b> (Psalms 78:65), i.e., since one had intent to consume two halves of an olive-bulk beyond their designated time, these intentions are joined together. The middle thought is disregarded, since it constitutes only half the requisite measure, and the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rav Hamnuna says: It constitutes a combination of</b> improper <b>intentions. </b> The middle thought, although itself insufficient to disqualify the offering, is sufficient to interfere with the intention to consume it beyond its time, and the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>. |
| Psalms 78:67 | it is written: “Moreover he abhorred the tent of Joseph and chose not the tribe of Ephraim” | Zevachim 118a:13 | § The Mishnah teaches that when <b>they arrived at Shiloh, </b> private altars were prohibited.

| Psalms 78:67 | and it is written: “Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim” | Zevachim 118b:7 | The Talmud relates that <b>when Abaye went</b> to study Torah with Rav Yosef, <b>he said</b> the statement of Rav Dimi <b>before Rav Yosef. </b> Rav Yosef <b>said</b> in response: <b>Kaylil, </b> Abaye’s father, <b>had one son, and he is not proper.

| Psalms 80:2 | as it is stated: “Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads like the flock of Joseph” | Sotah 36b:15 | <b>“By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob”</b> (Genesis 49:24): <b>Who caused his</b> name <b>to be etched onto the stones of the ephod? </b> It was <b>only the might of Jacob. “From there, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel”</b> (Genesis 49:24) means: <b>From there, </b> because of Joseph’s ability to withstand this trial, <b>he merited to become a shepherd [<i>ro’eh</i>]</b> of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads like the flock of Joseph”</b> (Psalms 80:2). |
| Psalms 80:3 | as it is written with regard to them: “Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your might” | Megillah 16a:14 | The Talmud explains that their wise remark, which earned them their distinction, is contained in their advice: <b>“If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews [<i>Yehudim</i>], </b> then you will not prevail over him” (Esther 6:13). The word <i>Yehudim</i> can also refer to people from the tribe of Judah. Haman’s wise men thereby <b>said to him: If he descends from the other tribes, you can</b> still <b>prevail over him, but if he</b> descends <b>from the tribe of</b> either <b>Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, or Manasseh, you cannot prevail over him. </b> With regard to <b>Judah, </b> the proof of this is <b>as it is written: “Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies”</b> (Genesis 49:8), indicating that Judah will emerge victorious over his enemies. And the proof that Haman cannot prevail over <b>the others</b> that were mentioned is <b>as it is written with regard to them: “Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Your might”</b> (Psalms 80:3). |
| Psalms 80:6 | and given them tears to drink in great measure” | Niddah 55b:21 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches that in the case of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, the tears of their eyes and the blood from their wounds, as well as the milk of a <i>zava</i>, all transmit the ritual impurity of liquids. The Talmud cites the source for these cases of impurity: <b>The tears of his eye</b> are classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written: </b> “You have fed them with the bread of tears, <b>and given them tears to drink in great measure”</b> (Psalms 80:6). <b>And</b> the <b>blood from his wound</b> is classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written: “And he shall drink the blood of the slain”</b> (Numbers 23:24). Although the verse is referring to the blood of a dead person, and not to the blood of a wound, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if one <b>killed all of him, </b> and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if one <b>killed part of him, </b> i.e., wounded him? With regard to the <b>milk of a woman, </b> it too is classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written: “And she opened the bottle of milk, and gave him to drink”</b> (Judges 4:19). |
| Psalms 80:6 | “You have fed them with the bread of tears and have given them tears to drink in great measure [ shalish ]” | Sanhedrin 97b:6 | <b>And</b> the Messiah will come <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Simlai, who would interpret</b> the verse: <b>“You have fed them with the bread of tears and have given them tears to drink in great measure [<i>shalish</i>]”</b> (Psalms 80:6), to mean that the duration of the ultimate exile will be three times the duration of the period of the exile in Egypt. |
| Psalms 80:9 | states: “You plucked up a vine out of Egypt; | Chullin 92a:11 | <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Jewish people, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “You plucked up a vine out of Egypt; </b> You drove out the nations and planted it” (Psalms 80:9). <b>“Three branches”; these are the three</b> pilgrimage <b>Festivals, on which the Jewish people ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>every year. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, ”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be fruitful and multiply, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, </b> and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7). |
| Psalms 80:14 | “The boar out of the wood [ miya’ar ] ravages it” | Kiddushin 30a:11 | <b>Therefore, </b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> rabbis <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>], </b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll. </b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses. </b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms, </b> with regard to its number of letters. The verse: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity”</b> (Psalms 78:38), <b>is the midpoint</b> of <b>verses</b> in the book of Psalms. |
| Psalms 80:14 | that dwells between the reeds, as it is written: “The pig out of the wood ravages it, and that which moves in the field feeds on it” | Pesachim 118b:15 | <b>Alternatively, </b> the verse <b>“Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, ”</b> means rebuke the beast <b>that dwells between the reeds, as it is written: “The pig out of the wood ravages it, and that which moves in the field feeds on it”</b> (Psalms 80:14). This verse is referring to Edom, whose behavior is compared elsewhere to that of a pig. |
| Psalms 81:2 | “Sing aloud to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob” | Rosh Hashanah30b:12 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the daily offering on Rosh HaShana, </b> in <b>the morning it is sacrificed in accordance with its</b> regular <b><i>halakhot</i>, </b> i.e., the Levites recite the regular psalm for that day of the week. When it comes <b>to the additional offering</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite? </b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:2). With regard <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon</b> offering, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite? </b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“The voice of YHWH shakes the wilderness”</b> (Psalms 29:8). |
| Psalms 81:2 | “Sing aloud to God our strength” | Rosh Hashanah31a:5 | <b>On the 5th</b> day of the week the Levites <b>would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength”</b> (Psalms 81:2), <b>because</b> on the 5th day of Creation <b>He created birds and fish to praise His name. On the 6th</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“YHWH reigns, He is clothed with majesty”</b> (Psalms 93:1), <b>because</b> on that day <b>He completed His labor and ruled over</b> all of creation in full glory. <b>On the 7th</b> day of the week, Shabbat, <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat”</b> (Psalms 92:1), <b>as</b> the future world will be <b>a day that is all Shabbat. </b> |
| Psalms 81:4 | for our Festival day” | Beitzah 16a:2 | <b>R' Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> from which this dictum is derived? The source is: <b>“Blow the <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the concealed</b> time <b>for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). <b>On which Festival is the new moon concealed? </b> You <b>must say</b> that <b>it is Rosh HaShana, </b> which occurs on the first of the month, when the moon is not yet visible, while the moon is visible during the other Festivals, which occur in the middle of the month. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For it is a statute [<i>ḥok</i>] for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5). |
| Psalms 81:4 | “Sound a shofar at the New Moon” | Rosh Hashanah11b:3 | It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In Nisan</b> our forefathers <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt, <b>as it is</b> explicitly stated in the Torah. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In Tishrei in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption. <b>This is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i></b> and another instance of the word <b><i>shofar</i>.

| Psalms 81:4 | “Sound [ tiku ] | Rosh Hashanah16a:17 | <b>R' Yitzḥak said: Why does one sound</b> [<b><i>tokin</i></b>] a blast <b>on Rosh HaShana? </b> The Talmud is astonished by the question: <b>Why do we sound</b> a blast? <b>God states</b> in the verse: <b>“Sound [<i>tiku</i>]</b> a <i>shofar</i>” (Psalms 81:4). <b>Rather, </b> the question is: <b>Why does one sound</b> a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> in addition to a long continuous <i>shofar</i> blast [<i>tekia</i>]? The Talmud is still surprised by the question: <b>Sound a <i>terua</i>? God states: </b> “In the 7th month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, <b>a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>Rather, </b> R' Yitzḥak asked about the common practice in Jewish communities, which is not explicitly stated in the Torah: <b>Why does one sound</b> a long, continuous <i>shofar</i> <b>blast [<i>tekia</i>] and</b> then a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> while the congregation is still <b>sitting</b> before the silent prayer, |

| Psalms 81:4 | Tishrei?

| Psalms 81:4 | “Sound the shofar at the New Moon, at the concealed time for our Festival day” | Sanhedrin 11b:9 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:7): The court <b>may intercalate the year only during the day; and if</b> the court <b>intercalated it at night, it is not intercalated.

Rav Abba says: What is the verse</b> from which this <i>halakha</i> is derived? <b>“Sound the shofar at the New Moon, at the concealed time for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). On <b>which Festival is the new moon concealed? You must say it is Rosh HaShana, </b> which occurs on the first of the month, before the moon is visible, whereas the moon is visible during the other Festivals, which occur later in the month. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5). <b>Just as</b> all civil <b>judgment is</b> done <b>during the day, so too is</b> the sanctification of Rosh HaShana, and <b>the sanctification of the month</b> in general, done <b>during the day. </b> |

Ammon and Moab <b>sent to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>God already designated the time of their</b> redemption, <b>as it is stated: “On the day of the <i>keseh</i>, He will come home”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), and <b><i>keseh</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> a designated <b>time, as it is stated: </b> “Sound a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, <b>at the <i>keseh</i> on the day of our feast”</b> (Psalms 81:4). Since there is a time designated for redemption, until then you can do as you please.

| Psalms 81:5 | “For it is a statute [ ḥok ] for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob” | Beitzah 16a:2 | <b>R' Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> from which this dictum is derived?

| Psalms 81:5 | Judgment, is written with regard to | Rosh Hashanah22b:2 | The Talmud comments: <b>This too stands to reason, for if you do not say so, </b> then the opening statement of the Mishnah: <b>If</b> the members of the Great Sanhedrin <b>are not familiar with that</b> one, is problematic. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>that one</b> witness, <b>is one</b> witness <b>deemed credible? </b> The word: <b>Judgment, is written with regard to</b> the establishment of the New Moon and Rosh HaShana: “For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Israel” (Psalms 81:5), and judgments require two witnesses. <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>That pair</b> of witnesses. <b>So too</b> here, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Another?

| Psalms 81:5 | “For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment [ mishpat ] of the God of Jacob” | Rosh Hashanah25b:13 | The Talmud raises another difficulty: <b>Why not say</b> that, <b>indeed, </b> the sanctification of the month should be treated like monetary cases? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Rosh HaShana: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment [<i>mishpat</i>] of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5). <b>When does</b> the sanctification of the month <b>become a statute? At the end of the judicial process, and God calls it a judgment</b> as well, thereby teaching that <b>just as</b> the primary time of <b>a judgment is during the day, here too, </b> with regard to the sanctification of the New Moon, the process must take place <b>during the day, </b> and not at night. |
| Psalms 81:5 | “For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob” | Rosh Hashanah8b:1 | <b>on which the moon is covered, </b> i.e., hidden? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Rosh HaShana, </b> which is the only Festival that occurs at the beginning of a month, when the moon cannot be seen. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5), implying that this is the day of judgment. |
| Psalms 81:5 | “For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob” | Sanhedrin 11b:9 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:7): The court <b>may intercalate the year only during the day; and if</b> the court <b>intercalated it at night, it is not intercalated.

| Psalms 81:6 | “This He ordained in Joseph for testimony, when he went out | Rosh Hashanah11b:1 | And immediately afterward it is written: <b>“This He ordained in Joseph for testimony, when he went out</b> over the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6), implying that Joseph’s release from prison took place on Rosh HaShana. |
| Psalms 81:6 | as it is written: “He appointed it in Joseph [ bihosef ] for a testimony in his name, | Sotah 10b:9 | The verse states: <b>“And Judah acknowledged them, and said: She is more righteous than I; </b> forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son” (Genesis 38:26). <b>This is</b> the same <b>as Rav Ḥanin bar Bizna says</b> that <b>R' Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private</b> by not committing adultery with the wife of Potiphar, <b>merited that one letter from the name of God was added to his</b> name, <b>as it is written: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>bihosef</i> ] for a testimony in his name, </b> when He went forth against the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6). In this verse the name Joseph is written with an additional letter <i>heh</i>, found in the ineffable name of God. |
| Psalms 81:6 | as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [ Yehosef ] for a testimony, when he went forth against the land of Egypt, the speech of one that I did not know I heard” | Sotah 36b:20 | <b>They said to him: If</b> that is <b>so</b> and he is a child of royalty, <b>he should know</b> the <b>seventy languages</b> that all kings’ children learn.

Gabriel then <b>added one letter, </b> the letter <i>heh</i>, to Joseph’s name <b>from the name of God and</b> then <b>he</b> was able to <b>learn</b> the languages, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i>] for a testimony, when he went forth against the land of Egypt, the speech of one that I did not know I heard”</b> (Psalms 81:6). <b>And the next day, </b> when he appeared before Pharaoh, in <b>every language that Pharaoh spoke with him, he answered him. </b> |
| Psalms 81:6 | as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [ Yehosef ] for a testimony when He went forth against the land of Egypt” | Sotah 36b:8 | The Talmud asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i> that contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion: <b>Are these</b> names of the tribes, which were written on the ephod, composed of a total of <b>fifty letters? </b> There <b>are</b> only <b>forty-nine. R' Yitzḥak says: They added one letter to</b> the name of <b>Joseph [<i>Yosef</i>]</b> when it was written on the ephod, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i>] for a testimony when He went forth against the land of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 81:6). |
| Psalms 81:7 | “I removed his shoulder from the burden” | Rosh Hashanah11b:2 | It was also taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased. </b> From where is this known? <b>It is written here: “And I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:6); <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). From here it is derived by verbal analogy between the two instances of the word “burden” that just as Joseph was released from prison in Tishrei, so too, the slavery of our forefathers in Egypt ended in Tishrei. |
| Psalms 81:7 | Rather, what does one recite? “I removed his shoulder from the burden” | Rosh Hashanah30b:14 | <b>Rather, what does one recite? “I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7), which is referring to Joseph, who was set free from prison on Rosh HaShana. In other words, the second half of Psalm 81 was recited with the morning offering, while the first half was recited with the additional offering. <b>And if the witnesses came</b> on a Thursday <b>after the daily morning offering</b> had already been sacrificed, <b>one recites: “Sing aloud</b> to God” at the additional offering, <b>even though</b> this means <b>that one goes back and repeats that section</b> again. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Psalms 81:7 | what would they say? “I removed [ hasiroti ] his shoulder from the burden” | Sukkah 55a:5 | <b>On the 4th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “Consider [<i>binu</i>], you brutish among the people”</b> (Psalms 94:8). <b>On the 5th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “I removed [<i>hasiroti</i>] his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). <b>On the 6th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “All the foundations of the earth are moved [<i>yimotu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 82:5). <b>And if Shabbat occurred on any</b> of the intermediate days of the Festival, since Shabbat has its own song (Psalms 92), the last of the songs of the intermediate days, i.e., “All the foundations of the earth <b>are moved, ” is superseded, </b> and all the other songs are recited in their proper sequence. |
| Psalms 81:10 | this? “There shall not be a strange god within you, and you shall not bow to a foreign god” | Shabbat 105b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>Say that you heard</b> that R' Yehuda rules that one is liable for performing a labor not needed for its own sake <b>in</b> the case of <b>a constructive</b> act; <b>did you hear him</b> deem one liable <b>in</b> the case of <b>a destructive</b> act? <b>R' Avin said: This</b> case, where one rends his garment in anger, <b>is also constructive, </b> because in doing so <b>he assuages his anger. </b> Rending his garment calms him; therefore, it can be said that he derives benefit from the act of rending, and it is consequently a constructive act. The Talmud asks: <b>And is it</b> at all <b>permitted</b> to tear <b>in that manner? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Ḥilfa bar Agra, who said in the name of R' Yoḥanan ben Nuri: One who rends his garments in his anger, or who breaks his vessels in his anger, or who scatters his money in his anger, should be like an idol worshipper in your eyes, as that is the craft of the evil inclination. Today it tells him do this, and tomorrow it tells him do that, until</b> eventually, when he no longer controls himself, <b>it tells him worship idols and he goes and worships</b> idols. <b>R' Avin said: What verse</b> alludes to <b>this? “There shall not be a strange god within you, and you shall not bow to a foreign god”</b> (Psalms 81:10). <b>What is the strange god that is within a person’s body? Say that it is the evil inclination. </b> One may not rend his garments in anger, because in doing so he is deriving pleasure from satisfying the evil inclination. |
| Psalms 81:11 | “Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it” | Berakhot 50a:4 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Isn’t it written</b> that King David articulated his prayer in that manner: “Be pleased, therefore, to bless Your servant’s house, that it abide before You forever; for You, Lord God, have spoken. <b>And from Your blessing may Your servant’s house be blessed forever”</b> (II Samuel 7:29). David said: From Your blessing. The Talmud answers: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request it is different, </b> as it is inappropriate to demand the full bounty of God’s blessing. The Talmud questions this: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request, too, is it not written</b> that a request for the full bounty of God’s blessing is granted: <b>“Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it”</b> (Psalms 81:11)? What one receives corresponds to what he requests. The Talmud answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah, </b> where it is wholly appropriate to make excessive requests. |
| Psalms 82:1 | that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is located in a synagogue? As it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; | Berakhot 6a:8 | In explaining Abba Binyamin’s statement, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>R' Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God is located in a synagogue? As it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; </b> in the midst of the judges He judges” (Psalms 82:1). The congregation of God is the place where people congregate to sing God’s praises, and God is located among His congregation. |
| Psalms 82:1 | “God stands in the congregation of God” | Rosh Hashanah31a:4 | <b>On the 3rd</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“God stands in the congregation of God”</b> (Psalms 82:1), <b>because</b> on the 3rd day of Creation <b>He revealed the land in His wisdom and</b> thereby <b>prepared the world for His assembly</b> that could now live on the dry land. <b>On the 4th</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“O Lord God, to Whom vengeance belongs”</b> (Psalms 94:1), <b>because</b> on the 4th day of Creation <b>He created the sun and the moon, and in the future He will punish</b> and take vengeance upon <b>those who worship them. </b> |
| Psalms 82:1 | And the judges should know whom they are judging, and before Whom they are judging, and Who will ultimately exact payment from them, as it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God” | Sanhedrin 6b:14 | <b>And the judges should know whom they are judging, and before Whom they are judging, and Who will ultimately exact payment from them, as it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God”</b> (Psalms 82:1). <b>And similarly, with regard to Jehoshaphat it says: “And he said to the judges: Consider what you do; for you judge not for man, but for YHWH”</b> (II Chronicles 19:6). And <b>lest the judge say: What</b> value is there <b>for me with this suffering? </b> Why should I engage in such a burdensome and difficult task? <b>The verse states: “He is with you in giving judgment, ”</b> from which it is derived that in rendering his decision, <b>a judge has only that which his eyes see. </b> He is enjoined to render the best judgment possible based on the information he has available, and he is not accountable for anything else. |
| Psalms 82:1 | causes the Divine Presence to rest among Israel, as it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judges” | Sanhedrin 7a:17 | § The Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device indicating the following series of statements about judges and their functions: <b><i>Emet mamon yireh</i>. R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says: Any judge who judges a judgment</b> according to <b>absolute truth</b> [<i>emet</i>] <b>causes the Shekhina to rest among Israel, as it is stated: “God stands in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judges”</b> (Psalms 82:1), indicating that the Shekhina is in the midst of the court. <b>And every judge who does not judge a judgment</b> according to <b>absolute truth causes the Shekhina to withdraw from Israel, as it is stated: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says YHWH”</b> (Psalms 12:6). God will arise and leave the people as a result of oppression. |
| Psalms 82:1 | in the midst of the judges He judges” | Sotah 47b:18 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when those who whisper whisperings in judgment, </b> advising judges surreptitiously, <b>proliferated, fierce anger proliferated in Israel, and the Shekhina departed, because it is stated: </b> “God stands in the congregation of God; <b>in the midst of the judges He judges”</b> (Psalms 82:1). The Shekhina that dwells among judges leaves if they judge improperly. <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> those who are referred to in the verse: <b>“Their heart goes after their covetousness”</b> (Ezekiel 33:31), <b>proliferated, “Those who say to evil good, and to good evil”</b> (Isaiah 5:20) <b>proliferated, </b> i.e., those who treat wicked people as though they were righteous proliferated as a result. <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> the fulfillment of the verse: <b>“Those who say to evil good, and to good evil, ” proliferated, </b> the cry of: <b>Woe, woe, proliferated in the world. </b> There was an increase in troubles that cause people to cry out. |
| Psalms 82:3 | which is written: “Do justice to the afflicted and destitute” | Chullin 134a:13 | R' Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to</b> R' Yoḥanan: Even if <b>you teach that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>only in a language</b> whereby a certain imbecile named <b>ben Tedal</b> states that this is the opinion of R' Meir, a question remains, as <b>isn’t</b> there <b>a stated reason</b> for stringency in cases of uncertainties with regard to gifts left for the poor? <b>As R' Shimon ben Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Do justice to the afflicted and destitute”</b> (Psalms 82:3)? Specifically, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>“do justice”? </b> |
| Psalms 82:5 | what would they say? “All the foundations of the earth are moved [ yimotu ]” | Sukkah 55a:5 | <b>On the 4th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “Consider [<i>binu</i>], you brutish among the people”</b> (Psalms 94:8). <b>On the 5th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “I removed [<i>hasiroti</i>] his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). <b>On the 6th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “All the foundations of the earth are moved [<i>yimotu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 82:5). <b>And if Shabbat occurred on any</b> of the intermediate days of the Festival, since Shabbat has its own song (Psalms 92), the last of the songs of the intermediate days, i.e., “All the foundations of the earth <b>are moved, ” is superseded, </b> and all the other songs are recited in their proper sequence. |
| Psalms 82:6 | Rabbi Yosei says: The Jewish people accepted the Torah only in order that the Angel of Death would not rule over them, as it is stated: “I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High” | Avodah Zarah5a:15 | The Talmud answers: Reish Lakish <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>.

Then, God states: After <b>you ruined your deeds, “yet you shall die like a man, </b> and fall like one of the princes” (Psalms 82:7). |
| Psalms 82:6 | “I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High” | Avodah Zarah5a:6 | § The Talmud further discusses the sin of the Golden Calf. <b>Reish Lakish says: Come and let us be grateful to our ancestors</b> who sinned with the Golden Calf, <b>as had they not sinned we</b> would <b>not have come into the world. </b> Reish Lakish explains: <b>As it is stated</b> about the Jewish people after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High”</b> (Psalms 82:6), which indicates that they had become like angels and would not have propagated offspring. Then, God states: After <b>you ruined your deeds: “Yet you shall die like a man, </b> and fall like one of the princes” (Psalms 82:7). |
| Psalms 82:7 | you ruined your deeds, “yet you shall die like a man, | Avodah Zarah5a:15 | The Talmud answers: Reish Lakish <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>.

| Psalms 84:2 | is the Temple, as it is written: “How lovely [ yedidot ] are Your tabernacles” | Menachot 53b:1 | In the phrase: <b>Son of <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is Abraham, as it is written: “What has My beloved [<i>lididi</i>] to do in My house”</b> (Jeremiah 11:15). This verse is referring to Abraham, as will be explained. In the phrase: <b>And build <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is the Temple, as it is written: “How lovely [<i>yedidot</i>] are Your tabernacles”</b> (Psalms 84:2). And with regard to the term in the phrase: <b>For <i>Yadid</i>, this is God as it is written: “Let me sing of my Beloved [<i>lididi</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 5:1). |
| Psalms 84:5 | the verse states: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House” | Berakhot 32b:21 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> This is alluded to when <b>the verse states: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House”</b> (Psalms 84:5), immediately after which it is said: “They will yet praise You, Selah. ” |
| Psalms 84:5 | as it is stated: “Happy are they who dwell in Your house; they will yet praise You, Selah” | Sanhedrin 91b:16 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where</b> is <b>resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Happy are they who dwell in Your house; they will yet praise You, Selah”</b> (Psalms 84:5). It <b>is not stated: They praised you, </b> in the verse; <b>rather, </b> the term <b>“they will praise you”</b> is stated. <b>From here, resurrection of the dead</b> is derived <b>from the Torah. And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who recites song</b> to God <b>in this world is privileged and recites it in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Happy are they who dwell in Your house; they will yet praise You, Selah. ”</b> |
| Psalms 84:7 | However, that which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping” | Eruvin 19a:10 | <b>However, that which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping”</b> (Psalms 84:7), which implies that the sinners nonetheless descend to Gehenna, should be explained as follows: <b>There</b> it speaks of <b>those who are liable at that time</b> for punishment <b>in Gehenna, but our father Abraham comes and raises them up and receives them. </b> He does not leave the circumcised behind and allow them to enter Gehenna, <b>except for a Jew who had sex with a non-Jew woman, </b> in punishment for which <b>his foreskin is drawn, and</b> our father Abraham <b>does not recognize him</b> as one of his descendants. |
| Psalms 84:7 | which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping turn it into a water spring; moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings” | Eruvin 19a:4 | <b>And this is</b> what <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping turn it into a water spring; moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings”</b> (Psalms 84:7)? |
| Psalms 84:8 | is privileged to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion” | Berakhot 64a:11 | <b>R' Levi bar Ḥiyya said: One who leaves the synagogue and</b> immediately <b>enters the study hall and engages in Torah</b> study, <b>is privileged to receive the Shekhina, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8); those who go from a place of prayer to a place of Torah study are privileged to receive a divine revelation in Zion. |
| Psalms 84:8 | merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion” | Moed Katan29a:5 | <b>And R' Levi said: Anyone who leaves from the synagogue</b> and goes <b>to the study hall or</b> goes <b>from the study hall to the synagogue, </b> i.e., he goes from the mitzva of prayer to the mitzva of Torah study or vice versa, <b>merits to receive the Shekhina, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8). |
| Psalms 84:11 | I rejoiced. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: “For better is one day in your courtyard than one thousand” | Makkot 10a:23 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A song of the ascents to David: I rejoiced when they said to me, let us go to the house of God”</b> (Psalms 122:1)? <b>David said before God: God!, I heard people who were saying</b> in reference to me: <b>When will this old man die, and Solomon his son will come</b> and succeed him <b>and build the Temple and we will ascend</b> there <b>for the pilgrimage Festival? </b> It was common knowledge that the Temple would be constructed by David’s successor. David continued: <b>And</b> despite my pain that I am not privileged to build the Temple, <b>I rejoiced. God said to him: “For better is one day in your courtyard than one thousand”</b> (Psalms 84:11), meaning, <b>I prefer one day</b> during <b>which you engage in</b> the study of <b>Torah before Me than</b> the <b>one thousand burnt-offerings that your son Solomon is destined to sacrifice before Me upon the altar</b> (see I Kings 3:4). |
| Psalms 84:11 | said to him: “For a day in your courts is better than a thousand” | Shabbat 30a:9 | The Talmud continues: <b>And</b> that <b>which Solomon said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:4), <b>is in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What</b> is the meaning of that verse <b>which</b> David <b>said: “Lord, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am” (</b>Psalms 39:5)? It means that <b>David said before God: God!, Lord, make me to know my end; </b> in how long will I die? God <b>said to him: It is decreed before Me that</b> I do <b>not reveal the end of</b> the life of <b>flesh and blood. </b> He asked further: <b>And the measure of my days; </b> on <b>what</b> day of the year will I die? He said to him: <b>It is decreed before Me not to reveal the measure of a person’s days. </b> Again he requested: <b>Let me know how short-lived I am; </b> on what day of the week will I die? <b>He said to him: You will die on Shabbat. </b> David requested of God: <b>Let me die on the first</b> day <b>of the week</b> so that the honor of Shabbat will not be tarnished by the pain of death. <b>He said to him: </b> On that day <b>the</b> time of <b>the kingdom of your son Solomon has already arrived, and one kingdom does not overlap with another</b> and subtract from the time allotted to another <b>even a hairbreadth. </b> He said to him: <b>I will</b> cede a day of my life and <b>die on Shabbat eve. </b> God <b>said to him: “For a day in your courts is better than a thousand”</b> (Psalms 84:11); <b>a single day in which you sit and engage in Torah is preferable to Me than the thousand burnt-offerings that your son Solomon will offer before Me on the altar</b> (see I Kings 3:4). |
| Psalms 84:12 | And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Samson [ Shimshon ] is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the Lord God is a sun [ shemesh ] and a shield” | Sotah 10a:8 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Samson judged the Jewish people as their Father in Heaven</b> does, with complete justice, <b>as it is stated: “Dan shall judge his people, as one</b> of the tribes of Israel” (Genesis 49:16), which is interpreted to mean that Samson, from the tribe of Dan, judges his people just as God, Who is “One. ” <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Samson [<i>Shimshon</i>] is called by the name of God as it is stated: “For YHWH God is a sun [<i>shemesh</i>] and a shield”</b> (Psalms 84:12). The Talmud comments: <b>If that is so, </b> then his name <b>should not be erased</b> just like other sanctified names are not erased. <b>Rather, </b> he is not called by the name of God but his name <b>is akin to the name of God, </b> for <b>just as God protects the entire world, so too Samson, in his generation, protected all the Jewish people. </b> |
| Psalms 85:12 | my ancestors stored up below, whereas I am storing above, as it is stated: “Truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness will look down from heaven” | Bava Batra11a:3 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There was <b>an incident involving King Munbaz, who liberally gave away his treasures and the treasures of his ancestors in the years of drought, </b> distributing the money to the poor. <b>His brothers and his father’s household joined together against him</b> to protest against his actions, <b>and they said to him: Your ancestors stored up</b> money in their treasuries <b>and added to</b> the treasures <b>of their ancestors, and you are liberally distributing</b> it all to the poor. King Munbaz <b>said to them: </b> Not so, <b>my ancestors stored up below, whereas I am storing above, as it is stated: “Truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness will look down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12), meaning that the righteous deeds that one has performed are stored up in heaven. <b>My ancestors stored up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand can reach, </b> and so their treasures could have been robbed, <b>whereas I am storing up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand cannot reach, </b> and so they are secure, <b>as it is stated: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15). |
| Psalms 85:12 | Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: Rain falls only if the Jewish people’s transgressions have been forgiven, as it is stated: “Lord, You have been favorable to Your land; You have turned the captivity of Jacob; You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have pardoned all their sin. Selah” | Taanit 7b:3 | <b>R' Oshaya</b> likewise <b>said: The day of rain is great, as</b> rain <b>even</b> facilitates <b>salvation, </b> which <b>is fruitful and multiplies on</b> that day. It is a time of God’s favor, when salvation is brought forth into the world, <b>as it is stated: “Let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation”</b> (Isaiah 45:8). <b>R' Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: Rain falls only if the Jewish people’s transgressions have been forgiven, as it is stated: “Lord, You have been favorable to Your land; You have turned the captivity of Jacob; You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have pardoned all their sin. Selah”</b> (Psalms 85:2–3). This chapter proceeds to discuss rainfall: “And righteousness has looked down from Heaven” (Psalms 85:12), in the form of rain. |
| Psalms 85:12 | said: Rain falls only due to faithful people, as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven” | Taanit 8a:14 | <b>R' Ami</b> further <b>said: Rain falls only due to faithful people, as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12). When “truth springs out of the earth,” i.e., if people are faithful, they will find that “righteousness,” in the form of rain “has looked down from heaven. ” |
| Psalms 85:12 | as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven” | Taanit 8a:16 | § <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever is exacting with himself, </b> by striving to act righteously in every way on earth <b>below, he is judged in an exact manner</b> in Heaven <b>above, </b> in order to improve him further still, <b>as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12). <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And Your wrath is according to the fear that is due to You”</b> (Psalms 90:11). The level of God’s wrath correlates with the offender’s fear of God. |
| Psalms 85:14 | Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: A person is prohibited to attend to his own affairs before he prays, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path” | Berakhot 14a:16 | <b>And as Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: A person is prohibited to attend to his own affairs before he prays, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path”</b> (Psalms 85:14). One should first pray and acknowledge the righteousness of his Creator, and only then should he set out on his way. |
| Psalms 86:17 | “Perform on my behalf a sign for good, that they that hate me may see it and be put to shame” | Sanhedrin 107b:2 | David <b>said before Him</b> after this: <b>God!, pardon me for this sin. </b> God said to him: <b>It is forgiven for you. </b> David requested: <b>“Perform on my behalf a sign for good, that they that hate me may see it and be put to shame”</b> (Psalms 86:17); show me a sign in my lifetime so that everyone will know that You have forgiven me. God <b>said to him: In your lifetime I will not make</b> it <b>known</b> that you were forgiven, <b>but I will make</b> it <b>known in the lifetime of your son, Solomon. </b> |
| Psalms 86:17 | that was written: “Work on my behalf a sign for good; that they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame” | Shabbat 30a:6 | <b>Alternatively, </b> another explanation is given for the verse: <b>“And I praised</b> the dead that are already dead,” <b>is in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What</b> is the meaning of the verse <b>that was written: “Work on my behalf a sign for good; that they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame”</b> (Psalms 86:17)? <b>David said before God: God!, forgive me for that sin</b> in the matter of Bathsheba. <b>He said to him: It is forgiven you. </b> David <b>said to Him: Show me a sign in my lifetime</b> so that all will know that You have forgiven me.

| Psalms 87:2 | “The Lord loves the gates of Zion [ Tziyyon ] more than all the dwellings of Jacob” | Berakhot 8a:17 | Rafram <b>said to him, Rav Ḥisda said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“YHWH loves the gates of Zion [<i>Tziyyon</i>] more than all the dwellings of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 87:2)? This means that <b>YHWH loves the gates distinguished [<i>metzuyanim</i>] through</b> the study of <i>halakha</i> as they are the gates of Zion, the outstanding gates, <b>more than the synagogues and study halls. </b> Although those places are the most outstanding of the dwellings of Jacob, they are not engaged in the study of <i>halakha</i>. |
| Psalms 87:5 | “And of Zion it shall be said, this man and this man were born in her, and the Most High shall establish her” | Ketubot 75a:14 | § Since the Talmud quoted a statement of R' Yehoshua ben Levi’s grandson, the Talmud cites another exposition in his name. The verse states: <b>“And of Zion it shall be said, this man and this man were born in her, and the Most High shall establish her”</b> (Psalms 87:5). <b>R' Meyasha, son of the son of R' Yehoshua ben Levi, said: Both the</b> man who was actually <b>born in</b> Zion <b>and</b> the <b>one who looks forward to seeing her</b> are equally considered sons of Zion. <b>Abaye said: And one of</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael <b>is superior to two of us, </b> Babylonians. <b>Rava said: And one of us</b> Babylonians, <b>when he ascends to</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>is superior to two</b> people born and raised in Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud cites a proof for Rava’s claim: <b>As R' Yirmeya, when he was here, </b> in Babylonia, <b>did not</b> even <b>know what the rabbis say. </b> He was not considered an important scholar. But <b>when he ascended there, </b> it was <b>he</b>, and not the other rabbis of Eretz Yisrael, who <b>called us foolish Babylonians</b>. Evidently, he became even greater than they were. |
| Psalms 88:1 | it is written here: “Heman” | Bava Batra15a:10 | The Talmud asks: The <i>baraita</i> <b>counts Moses</b> among the ten elders whose works are included in the book of Psalms, <b>and it</b> also <b>counts Heman. But doesn’t Rav say: </b> The <b>Heman</b> mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) <b>is</b> the same person as <b>Moses? </b> This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “Heman”</b> (Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, <b>and it is written there</b> about Moses: <b>“For he is the trusted one in all My house”</b> (Numbers 12:7). The Talmud answers: <b>There were two Hemans, </b> one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel. |
| Psalms 88:6 | which is written: “Set apart [ ḥofshi ] among the dead, | Niddah 61b:5 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as R' Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Set apart [<i>ḥofshi</i>] among the dead, </b> like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more” (Psalms 88:6)? <b>Once a person dies, he becomes free [<i>ḥofshi</i>] from the mitzvot. </b> |
| Psalms 88:6 | “Set apart among the dead [ bametim ḥofshi ], | Shabbat 151b:8 | Incidental to the Talmud’s discussion of corpses, it cites that which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </b> For <b>a living day-old baby, one desecrates Shabbat</b> to save his life. Yet for the <b>deceased David, king of Israel, one does not desecrate Shabbat. </b> For <b>a day-old baby we desecrate Shabbat</b> because <b>the Torah says: Desecrate one Shabbat for him so that he can observe many <i>Shabbatot</i>. </b> But for the <b>deceased David, king of Israel, one does not desecrate</b> Shabbat, as <b>once a person dies he is idle from mitzvot. And this is what R' Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Set apart among the dead [<i>bametim ḥofshi</i>], </b> like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more” (Psalms 88:6). <b>Once a person dies, he becomes free [<i>ḥofshi</i>] from the mitzvot. </b> |
| Psalms 88:6 | that which is written: “Set free among the dead, | Shabbat 30a:4 | He resolved the contradictions in the following manner: This is <b>not difficult. That which David said: “The dead praise not YHWH, ” this is what he is saying: A person should always engage in Torah and mitzvot before he dies, as once</b> he is <b>dead he is idle from Torah and mitzvot and there is no praise for God, </b> from <b>him. And that is</b> what <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Set free among the dead, </b> like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more” (Psalms 88:6)? <b>When a person dies</b> he then <b>becomes free of Torah and mitzvot. </b> |
| Psalms 88:12 | Avadon, as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [ avadon ]?” | Eruvin 19a:17 | <b>She’ol, as it is written: “Out of the belly of the netherworld [<i>she’ol</i>] I cried and You did hear my voice”</b> (Jonah 2:3). <b>Avadon, as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [<i>avadon</i>]? ”</b> (Psalms 88:12). <b>Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [<i>shaḥat</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:10). <b>And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven, as it is written: “He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit [<i>bor shaon</i>], out of the miry clay [<i>tit hayaven</i>]”</b> (Psalms 40:3). <b>And Tzalmavet, as it is written: “Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death [<i>tzalmavet</i>], </b> bound in affliction and iron” (Psalms 107:10). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Taḥtit, </b> i.e., the underworld, <b>it is</b> known by <b>tradition</b> that this is its name. |
| Psalms 88:16 | Rabbi Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: From the moment that he is circumcised, as it is written: “I am poor and close to death from youth; I suffered your terrors [ emekha ], I am numb” | Sanhedrin 110b:13 | <b>It was stated</b> that additional <i>amora’im</i> expressed opinions about the same matter. <b>Ravina says: From the moment that</b> the child <b>is conceived, </b> even before his birth, he can enter the World-to-Come, <b>as it is written: “Their seed shall serve Him”</b> (Psalms 22:31); even as seed the child merits to enter the World-to-Come. <b>R' Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: From the moment that he is circumcised, as it is written: “I am poor and close to death from youth; I suffered your terrors [<i>emekha</i>], I am numb”</b> (Psalms 88:16). From the moment that one bears the mark that the Jewish people have due to fear of God [<i>eima</i>], he turns to God and he belongs to Him. |
| Psalms 89:1 | Ethan the Ezrahite” | Bava Batra15a:9 | It is further stated that <b>David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders, </b> whom the <i>baraita</i> proceeds to list. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let it also count Ethan the Ezrahite</b> among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <b>Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is</b> the same person as <b>Abraham. </b> Proof for this is the fact that <b>it is written here: </b> “A Maskil of <b>Ethan the Ezrahite”</b> (Psalms 89:1), <b>and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [<i>mizraḥ</i>], whom righteousness</b> met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse. |
| Psalms 89:3 | as it is stated: “For I have said: The world shall be built on kindness [ ḥesed ]” | Sanhedrin 58b:7 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what</b> reason <b>did Adam not marry his daughter? So that Cain would marry his sister</b> and they would procreate immediately, <b>as it is stated: “For I have said: The world shall be built on kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>]”</b> (Psalms 89:3). This verse alludes to the fact that at the beginning of the world’s existence it was permitted for men to marry their sisters, which was later forbidden in the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister…it is a shameful thing [<i>ḥesed</i>]” (Leviticus 20:17). The Talmud infers: If it had <b>not</b> been <b>so, </b> if God had not specially permitted Cain to marry his sister, she would have been <b>forbidden</b> to him. This is difficult according to the opinion of R' Akiva, who deems it permitted for a non-Jew to marry his sister. |
| Psalms 89:8 | “A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him” | Bava Kamma50a:22 | <b>R' Aḥa says: </b> Although Neḥunya ensured that others would have water, <b>even so, his son died of thirst, </b> fulfilling that which <b>is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3). This <b>teaches that God is scrupulous with those around Him, </b> i.e., the righteous, <b>even</b> to the extent <b>of a hairsbreadth [<i>hasa’ara</i>], </b> so that even minor transgressions elicit a severe punishment. <b>R' Neḥunya says: </b> The same idea may be learned <b>from here, </b> in the following verse: <b>“A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8), indicating that God is most careful and exacting with those that surround Him, i.e., the righteous. |
| Psalms 89:8 | from here: “A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all that are about Him” | Yevamot 121b:8 | <b>R' Abba said: Even so, the son</b> of Neḥunya the well digger <b>died of thirst, </b> and the merit of his father, who attended to the water supply, did not protect him, <b>as is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3), <b>which teaches that God is exacting with His surroundings, </b> i.e., the righteous who are close to Him, <b>up to a hairsbreadth [<i>sa’ara</i>], </b> so that even slight deviations can elicit severe punishment. <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> This idea is derived <b>from here: “A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all that are about Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8). This indicates that God is most feared by those that are nearest to Him, i.e., the righteous, because He is more exacting of them. |
| Psalms 89:9 | “Who is strong like You, O Lord?” | Gittin 56b:10 | <b>Abba Ḥanan says: </b> The verse states: <b>“Who is strong like You, O Lord? ”</b> (Psalms 89:9). <b>Who is strong and indurate like You, as You hear the abuse and the blasphemy of that wicked man and remain silent. </b> Similarly, <b>the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> that the verse: <b>“Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods [<i>elim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:11), should be read as: <b>Who is like You among the mute [<i>ilmim</i>], </b> for You conduct Yourself like a mute and remain silent in the face of Your blasphemers. |
| Psalms 89:13 | And it is written: “North and right, You have created them” | Bava Batra25b:6 | § <b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the Temple was destroyed the southern wind has not brought rain, as it is stated</b> in the description of the destruction of the Temple: <b>“He decrees on the right and there is hunger, and consumes on the left and they are not satisfied”</b> (Isaiah 9:19). This means that God decreed that the southern wind, which is called right, shall bring famine with it. <b>And it is written: “North and right, You have created them”</b> (Psalms 89:13). This proves that the term right means south. |
| Psalms 89:15 | as it is stated: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne” | Bava Batra11a:3 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There was <b>an incident involving King Munbaz, who liberally gave away his treasures and the treasures of his ancestors in the years of drought, </b> distributing the money to the poor. <b>His brothers and his father’s household joined together against him</b> to protest against his actions, <b>and they said to him: Your ancestors stored up</b> money in their treasuries <b>and added to</b> the treasures <b>of their ancestors, and you are liberally distributing</b> it all to the poor. King Munbaz <b>said to them: </b> Not so, <b>my ancestors stored up below, whereas I am storing above, as it is stated: “Truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness will look down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12), meaning that the righteous deeds that one has performed are stored up in heaven. <b>My ancestors stored up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand can reach, </b> and so their treasures could have been robbed, <b>whereas I am storing up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand cannot reach, </b> and so they are secure, <b>as it is stated: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15). |
| Psalms 89:15 | through righteousness and justice, as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne” | Chagigah 12a:14 | Scriptural proof is provided for this statement as follows: It was created <b>through wisdom and through understanding, as it is written: “YHWH founded earth with wisdom, and established the heavens with understanding”</b> (Proverbs 3:19); <b>through knowledge, as it is written: “With His knowledge the depths were broken up”</b> (Proverbs 3:20); <b>through strength and through might, as it is written: “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, who is girded about with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7); <b>through rebuke, as it is written: “The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke”</b> (Job 26:11); <b>through righteousness and justice, as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>through kindness and mercy, as it is written: “Remember Your mercies, O Lord, and Your kindnesses, for they are from times of old”</b> (Psalms 25:6). |
| Psalms 89:15 | as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne” | Chagigah 12b:12 | <b><i>Aravot</i>, </b> skies, is the firmament <b>that contains righteousness; justice; righteousness, </b> i.e., charity; <b>the treasuries of life; the treasuries of peace; the treasuries of blessing; the souls of the righteous; the spirits and souls that are to be created; and the dew that God will use to revive the dead. </b> The Talmud proves this statement: <b>Righteousness and justice</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>righteousness, as it is written: “And He donned righteousness as armor”</b> (Isaiah 59:17); <b>the treasuries of life, as it is written: “For with You is the source of life”</b> (Psalms 36:10). <b>And the treasuries of peace</b> are found in heaven, <b>as it is written: “And he called Him YHWH of peace”</b> (Judges 6:24), implying that peace is God’s name and is therefore found close to Him. <b>And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from YHWH”</b> (Psalms 24:5). |
| Psalms 89:20 | Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness. Holiness leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. And piety is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones” | Avodah Zarah20b:10 | <b>From here R' Pineḥas ben Ya’ir</b> would <b>say: Torah</b> study <b>leads to care</b> in the performance of mitzvot. <b>Care</b> in the performance of mitzvot <b>leads to diligence</b> in their observance. <b>Diligence leads to cleanliness</b> of the soul. <b>Cleanliness</b> of the soul <b>leads to abstention</b> from all evil. <b>Abstention</b> from evil <b>leads to purity</b> and the elimination of all base desires. <b>Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness. Holiness leads to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. And piety is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones”</b> (Psalms 89:20). |
| Psalms 89:21 | as it is written: “I have found David My servant” | Bava Batra91b:10 | <b>“Who had dominion in Moab, ”</b> this means <b>that they married Moabite women. “And Jashubi Lehem, ” this</b> is referring to <b>Ruth the Moabite, who returned [<i>sheshava</i>] and attached</b> herself <b>to Bethlehem</b> of <b>Judea. “And the matters are ancient, ”</b> this means that <b>these matters were said by the Ancient of Days, </b> i.e., they occurred through God’s will, <b>as it is written: “I have found David My servant”</b> (Psalms 89:21); <b>and</b> the same term “found” also appears with regard to the daughters of Lot, as <b>it is written: “Your two daughters that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15). This teaches that David’s ancestry can be traced this far back, as he was destined to be born from Moab, who was the son of Lot’s daughter and Lot himself. |
| Psalms 89:21 | it is written: “I have found David, My servant; I have anointed him with My holy oil” | Yevamot 77a:7 | With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Then I said: Behold, I have come; in the scroll of a book it is written about me”</b> (Psalms 40:8)? <b>David said: I</b> had <b>said</b> that <b>I have come</b> only <b>now; </b> my life was created only recently, at the time of my birth. <b>But I did not know that it was</b> already <b>written about me in the scroll of a book, </b> that an ancient text already hints at my existence. <b>There, </b> with regard to the daughters of Lot, <b>it is written: </b> “And your two daughters <b>that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15), and <b>here, </b> with regard to David, <b>it is written: “I have found David, My servant; I have anointed him with My holy oil”</b> (Psalms 89:21). The lost article that was found among the daughters of Lot, the mothers of Ammon and Moab, is David and his royal house. |
| Psalms 89:33 | there is no suffering without iniquity, as it is written: “Then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with strokes” | Shabbat 55a:18 | The Talmud adduces proof to these assertions: <b>There is no death without sin, as it is written: “The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him”</b> (Ezekiel 18:20). A person dies only because of his own sins and not because of some preexistent sin. And <b>there is no suffering without iniquity, as it is written: “Then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with strokes”</b> (Psalms 89:33). |
| Psalms 89:33 | as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes” | Yoma 86a:7 | These are the categories: If <b>one violates a positive</b> mitzva <b>and repents, he is forgiven even before he moves</b> from his place, i.e. immediately, <b>as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children, </b> I will heal your backsliding” (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that when one repents he is immediately forgiven. If <b>one violates a prohibition and repents, repentance suspends</b> his punishment <b>and Yom Kippur atones</b> for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, </b> to purify you <b>from all your sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). If <b>one commits</b> a transgression that warrants <b><i>karet</i> or</b> a sin punishable by <b>death</b> from the earthly <b>court and</b> then <b>repents, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend</b> his punishment, <b>and suffering absolves</b> and completes the atonement, <b>as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes”</b> (Psalms 89:33). |
| Psalms 89:52 | “That Your enemies taunted, Lord, that they have taunted the footsteps of Your anointed” | Sanhedrin 97a:4 | The verse states: <b>“That Your enemies taunted, Lord, that they have taunted the footsteps of Your anointed”</b> (Psalms 89:52). <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: During the generation that the son of David comes, the hall of the assembly</b> of the rabbis <b>will be</b> designated <b>for prostitution, and the Galilee will be destroyed, and the Gavlan, </b> i.e., Bashan, <b>will be desolate, and the residents of the border</b> who flee the neighboring non-Jews <b>will circulate from city to city and will receive no sympathy. The wisdom of scholars will diminish, and sin-fearing</b> people <b>will be despised. And the face of the generation will be like the face of a dog</b> in its impudence and shamelessness. |
| Psalms 90:1 | which is written: “Lord, You have been our dwelling place | Megillah 29a:8 | <b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Lord, You have been our dwelling place</b> in all generations” (Psalms 90:1)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>the synagogues and study halls. Abaye said: Initially, I used to study</b> Torah <b>in</b> my <b>home and pray in the synagogue. Once I heard</b> and understood <b>that which</b> King <b>David says: “Lord, I love the habitation of Your house”</b> (Psalms 26:8), <b>I would</b> always <b>study</b> Torah <b>in the synagogue, </b> to express my love for the place in which the Shekhina resides. |
| Psalms 90:1 | “A prayer of Moses” | Sanhedrin 111b:2 | The Talmud relates: <b>R' Ḥagga was walking up the stairs in the school of Rabba bar Sheila. He heard a certain child who said: “Your testimonies are very sure; sanctity becomes Your house, Lord, for the length of days”</b> (Psalms 93:5). The phrase “length of days” is a reference to the attribute of slow to anger. <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the phrase: <b>“A prayer of Moses”</b> (Psalms 90:1), indicating that this chapter was also stated by Moses our teacher. Upon hearing those verses, R' Ḥagga <b>said: Conclude from it</b> that it was the attribute of <b>slow to anger</b> that Moses <b>saw. </b> |
| Psalms 90:2 | as it is written: “Before the mountains were brought forth, | Nedarim 39b:6 | <b>Repentance</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Before the mountains were brought forth, </b> or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God” (Psalms 90:2), <b>and it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“You return man to contrition; </b> and You say: Repent, children of man” (Psalms 90:3). |
| Psalms 90:3 | “You return man to contrition; | Nedarim 39b:6 | <b>Repentance</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Before the mountains were brought forth, </b> or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God” (Psalms 90:2), <b>and it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“You return man to contrition; </b> and You say: Repent, children of man” (Psalms 90:3). |
| Psalms 90:4 | “For a thousand years in Your eyes are but like yesterday when it is past, | Sanhedrin 97a:13 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ketina: Just as the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates</b> debts <b>once in seven years, so too, the world abrogates</b> its typical existence for <b>one thousand years in</b> every <b>seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And YHWH alone shall be exalted on that day, ” and it states: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day”</b> (Psalms 92:1), meaning <b>a day, </b> i.e., one thousand years, <b>that is entirely Shabbat. And it says</b> in explanation of the equation between one day and one thousand years: <b>“For a thousand years in Your eyes are but like yesterday when it is past, </b> and like a watch in the night” (Psalms 90:4). |
| Psalms 90:10 | How many are the years of man? Seventy years, as it is stated: “The span of our life is seventy years, or if we are strong, eighty years” | Chagigah 13a:3 | <b>How many are the years of man? Seventy years, as it is stated: “The span of our life is seventy years, or if we are strong, eighty years”</b> (Psalms 90:10). <b>Now is</b> there <b>not from the earth to the firmament a walking</b> distance <b>of five hundred years, and the thickness of the firmament</b> itself is <b>a walking</b> distance <b>of five hundred years, and a similar</b> distance exists <b>between each and every one of the firmaments? </b> |
| Psalms 90:10 | strength, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy, or if by reason of strength, eighty years” | Moed Katan28a:10 | One who dies at the age of <b>seventy</b> has reached <b>old age. </b> One who dies at the age of <b>eighty</b> dies in <b>strength, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy, or if by reason of strength, eighty years”</b> (Psalms 90:10). <b>Rabba said: </b> Not only is death at the age of fifty a sign of <i>karet</i>, but even death <b>from fifty to sixty years</b> of age <b>is death by <i>karet</i>. And</b> the reason that <b>all of these years were not counted</b> in connection with <i>karet</i> is <b>due to the honor of Samuel from Ramah, </b> who died at the age of fifty-two. |
| Psalms 90:10 | with strength, eighty years, as it is stated: “The days of our years are seventy years and with strength eighty years” | Pesachim 94b:1 | the <b>disciple</b> in corruption <b>of Nimrod the wicked, who caused the entire world to rebel against Me during his reign</b> by advising the generation of the dispersion to build a tower in order to fight the Hosts of Heaven, <b>how many are the years of a person</b> altogether? <b>Seventy years, and if</b> he is <b>with strength, eighty years, as it is stated: “The days of our years are seventy years and with strength eighty years”</b> (Psalms 90:10). |
| Psalms 90:10 | days, | Sanhedrin 106b:21 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Doeg and Ahithophel did not reach half of their</b> allotted <b>days, </b> as they died before the age of thirty-five, half of the standard lifetime mentioned in the verse: “The days of our years are seventy years” (Psalms 90:10). <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Bloody and deceitful men shall not live half their days”</b> (Psalms 55:24); <b>all the years of Doeg were only thirty-four, and</b> the years <b>of Ahithophel were only thirty-three. </b> |
| Psalms 90:10 | diminished, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy years, | Yevamot 64b:4 | However, <b>Rabba</b> himself <b>said: These principles are not</b> accepted as <i>halakha</i>.

Yet, <b>in the days of</b> King <b>David, </b> many years before the time of R' Yehuda HaNasi, <b>the years</b> of an average lifespan <b>were</b> already <b>diminished, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy years, </b> and if with strength eighty years” (Psalms 90:10). Consequently, if R' Yehuda HaNasi included in the Mishnah the statement that one remains married for ten years, that must apply even nowadays. |
| Psalms 90:11 | from here: “And Your wrath is according to the fear that is due to You” | Taanit 8a:16 | § <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever is exacting with himself, </b> by striving to act righteously in every way on earth <b>below, he is judged in an exact manner</b> in Heaven <b>above, </b> in order to improve him further still, <b>as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12). <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And Your wrath is according to the fear that is due to You”</b> (Psalms 90:11). The level of God’s wrath correlates with the offender’s fear of God. |
| Psalms 90:12 | Ameimar said: And a Sage is greater than a prophet, as it is stated: “And a prophet has a heart of wisdom” | Bava Batra12a:14 | <b>Ameimar said: And a Sage is greater than a prophet, as it is stated: “And a prophet has a heart of wisdom”</b> (Psalms 90:12), i.e., he is wise. When comparisons are drawn, <b>who is compared to whom? You must say</b> that <b>the lesser is compared to the greater. </b> Here too, prophecy is compared to wisdom, thus indicating that wisdom is greater than prophecy. |
| Psalms 90:15 | and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us, the years that we saw evil” | Sanhedrin 99a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer says: The messianic era</b> will be <b>forty years</b> long. <b>It is written here</b> with regard to the forty-year sojourn of the children of Israel in the wilderness: <b>“And He afflicted you, and suffered you to hunger and fed you</b> with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3); <b>and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us, the years that we saw evil”</b> (Psalms 90:15). |
| Psalms 91:1 | “He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty” | Shevuot 15b:10 | <b>And they recited</b> the psalm from the verse: <b>“He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of God”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>until</b> they completed the verse: <b>“Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation”</b> (Psalms 91:9). <b>And they would then recite</b> Psalms, chapter 3, which begins: <b>“A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how many are my enemies become, ” until</b> they reached the verse: <b>“Salvation belongs to YHWH; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela”</b> (Psalms 3:9), which is the end of that psalm. |
| Psalms 91:1 | “Who dwell in secret, with the Most High” | Sotah 9a:3 | <b>She acted in secret; </b> therefore, God, referred to in the verse <b>“Who dwell in secret, with the Most High”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>turns</b> His <b>face to her, as it is stated: “The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying: No eye shall see me; </b> and the Hidden Face will turn” (Job 24:15). The adulterer acts in the twilight of the night to act in secrecy, and therefore God, Who is concealed, arranges that the matter is revealed in public. |
| Psalms 91:6 | in the afternoon is called ketev yashud tzaharayim | Pesachim 111b:8 | The Talmud discusses the <b><i>ketev meriri</i>, </b> a demon mentioned in the Torah (Deuteronomy 32:24). <b>There are two</b> types <b>of <i>ketev</i></b> demons, <b>one</b> that comes <b>before noon</b> in the morning <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> comes <b>in the afternoon. </b> The one <b>that</b> comes <b>before noon is called <i>ketev meriri</i>, and it appears in a jug of <i>kutaḥ</i>, </b> a Babylonian spice, and continuously <b>revolves around inside it. </b> The <i>ketev</i> <b>in the afternoon is called <i>ketev yashud tzaharayim</i></b> (Psalms 91:6), <b>and it appears inside the horn of a goat and revolves around inside it like a sifter. </b> |
| Psalms 91:7 | to his left and ten thousand to his right. | Berakhot 6a:4 | <b>Rav Huna said: Each and every one of us has a thousand</b> demons <b>to his left and ten thousand to his right. </b> God protects man from these demons, as it says in the verse: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; they will not approach you” (Psalms 91:7). |
| Psalms 91:7 | that it is written: “A thousand shall fall at your side | Shevuot 15b:9 | The reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song <b>of plagues</b> is <b>that it is written: “Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling”</b> (Psalms 91:10). <b>And</b> the reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song of <b>evil spirits</b> is <b>that it is written: “A thousand shall fall at your side</b> and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you” (Psalms 91:7). |
| Psalms 91:7 | and it says: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right side” | Yoma 53b:3 | The Talmud comments that <b>this was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prays must take three steps backward</b> upon concluding his prayer <b>and then recite: Peace. And if he did not do so, it is better for him not to have prayed, </b> as his actions are disrespectful toward God. <b>And they said in the name of Shemaya</b> the Sage <b>that</b> when <b>one recites: Peace, </b> he first bows <b>to the right and then to the left, as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>and it says: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right side”</b> (Psalms 91:7). |
| Psalms 91:9 | “Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation” | Shevuot 15b:10 | <b>And they recited</b> the psalm from the verse: <b>“He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of God”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>until</b> they completed the verse: <b>“Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation”</b> (Psalms 91:9). <b>And they would then recite</b> Psalms, chapter 3, which begins: <b>“A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how many are my enemies become, ” until</b> they reached the verse: <b>“Salvation belongs to YHWH; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela”</b> (Psalms 3:9), which is the end of that psalm. |
| Psalms 91:10 | Is it not written: “No evil shall befall you, | Berakhot 55b:5 | The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>Is it not written: “No evil shall befall you, </b> neither shall any plague come near your tent” (Psalms 91:10)? <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> in explanation of that verse: This means <b>that you will be frightened neither by bad dreams nor by evil thoughts. Neither shall any plague come near your tent, </b> means <b>that you will never find your wife</b> with the <b>uncertain</b> status of a <b>menstruating woman when you return from a journey. </b> This proves that it is impossible that a righteous person will experience bad dreams throughout his life. <b>Rather, </b> one might say that <b>he does not see</b> bad dreams; <b>others see</b> bad dreams about him. |
| Psalms 91:10 | which is written: “No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your tent” | Sanhedrin 103a:13 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “No evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your tent”</b> (Psalms 91:10)? <b>“No evil shall befall you”</b> means <b>that the evil inclination shall not dominate them. “Nor shall any plague come near your tent”</b> means <b>that you will never find your wife</b> in a state of <b>uncertainty</b> whether she has the halakhic status of <b>a menstruating woman when you return from a journey. </b> After a period of separation, when a husband desires his wife, her uncertain status may prove more frustrating than a situation where the prohibition is clear-cut. |
| Psalms 91:10 | that it is written: “Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling” | Shevuot 15b:9 | The reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song <b>of plagues</b> is <b>that it is written: “Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling”</b> (Psalms 91:10). <b>And</b> the reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song of <b>evil spirits</b> is <b>that it is written: “A thousand shall fall at your side</b> and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you” (Psalms 91:7). |
| Psalms 91:11 | they testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will command His angels over you, to guard you in all your ways” | Chagigah 16a:17 | <b>And the rabbis say: A person’s soul</b> shall itself <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “Guard the doors of your mouth from she who lies in your bosom”</b> (Micah 7:5). <b>What thing lies in a person’s bosom? You must say it is</b> his <b>soul. R' Zerika said: </b> The <b>two ministering angels who accompany him, </b> i.e., each individual, <b>they testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will command His angels over you, to guard you in all your ways”</b> (Psalms 91:11). <b>And the rabbis say: A person’s limbs testify against him, as it is stated: “Therefore you are My witnesses, says YHWH, and I am God”</b> (Isaiah 43:12), which indicates that each individual becomes his own witness and testifies against himself on the Day of Judgment. |
| Psalms 91:11 | testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will give His angels charge over you, | Taanit 11a:9 | The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And lest a person say, </b> I have acted in secret; <b>who will testify against me</b> on the Day of Judgment? The <i>tanna</i> explains that the <b>stones of a person’s house and</b> the <b>beams of a person’s house</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For a stone shall cry out from the wall, and a beam out of the timber shall answer it”</b> (Habakkuk 2:11). In <b>the school of R' Sheila they say: </b> The <b>two ministering angels who accompany a person</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will give His angels charge over you, </b> to keep you in all your ways” (Psalms 91:11). |
| Psalms 91:15 | “I will be with him in trouble” | Taanit 16a:5 | The Talmud further asks: <b>And why do they cover themselves in sackcloth? R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: </b> This is as though <b>to say: We are considered</b> before You <b>like animals, </b> which are likewise covered with hide. <b>And why do they place burnt ashes on top of the ark? R' Yehuda ben Pazi said: </b> This is <b>as though to say</b> in God’s name: <b>“I will be with him in trouble”</b> (Psalms 91:15). <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the same idea can be derived from a different verse: <b>“In all their affliction, He was afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 63:9). By placing burnt ash on the ark, which is the symbol of the Shekhina, it is as though God Himself joins the Jews in their pain. <b>R' Zeira said: At first, when I saw the rabbis place burnt ashes upon the ark, my entire body trembled</b> from the intensity of the event. |
| Psalms 92:1 | “A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat” | Rosh Hashanah31a:5 | <b>On the 5th</b> day of the week the Levites <b>would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength”</b> (Psalms 81:2), <b>because</b> on the 5th day of Creation <b>He created birds and fish to praise His name.

| Psalms 92:1 | seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day,” and it states: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day” | Sanhedrin 97a:13 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ketina: Just as the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates</b> debts <b>once in seven years, so too, the world abrogates</b> its typical existence for <b>one thousand years in</b> every <b>seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And YHWH alone shall be exalted on that day, ” and it states: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day”</b> (Psalms 92:1), meaning <b>a day, </b> i.e., one thousand years, <b>that is entirely Shabbat. And it says</b> in explanation of the equation between one day and one thousand years: <b>“For a thousand years in Your eyes are but like yesterday when it is past, </b> and like a watch in the night” (Psalms 90:4). |
| Psalms 92:3 | as it is stated: “To declare Your kindness in the morning and Your faith in the nights” | Berakhot 12a:23 | <b>Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: One who did not recite: True and Firm [<i>emet veyatziv</i>]</b> at the beginning of the blessing of redemption that follows <i>Shema</i> <b>in the morning prayer, and: True and Trustworthy [<i>emet ve’emuna</i>] in the evening prayer, he did not fulfill his obligation. </b> An allusion to the difference in formulation between morning and evening is, <b>as it is stated: “To declare Your kindness in the morning and Your faith in the nights”</b> (Psalms 92:3). In the morning, one must mention God’s loving-kindness, while in the evening one is required to emphasize the aspect of faith. |
| Psalms 92:4 | to the melody [ higayon ] of a lyre” | Eruvin 21a:16 | The Talmud explains: <b>“Lamentations, ” this</b> refers to <b>the punishment of the righteous in this world, and so it is stated: “It is a lamentation and they shall make lament with it”</b> (Ezekiel 32:16). <b>“And melody [<i>hegeh</i>], ” this</b> refers to <b>the reward of the righteous in the World-to-Come, and</b> the proof that this word is an expression of joy is the verse that <b>states: </b> “Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the harp, <b>to the melody [<i>higayon</i>] of a lyre”</b> (Psalms 92:4). <b>And “woe [<i>vahi</i>], ” this is the punishment of the wicked in the World-to-Come, and so it states: “Calamity [<i>hova</i>] shall follow upon calamity”</b> (Ezekiel 7:26). |
| Psalms 92:13 | which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon” | Bava Batra80b:14 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches: In the case <b>of palm and cedar trees, </b> a buyer may <b>dig down and uproot</b> them, <b>because their trunks do not replenish</b> themselves after being cut down. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> is it correct with regard to <b>a cedar</b> that <b>its trunk does not replenish</b> itself? <b>But didn’t R' Ḥiyya bar Lulyani teach: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 92:13)? <b>If “palm tree” is stated, why is “cedar” stated? And if “cedar” is stated, why is “palm tree” stated? </b> What is added by this double comparison? |
| Psalms 92:13 | which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon” | Taanit 25a:20 | Since the Talmud has mentioned R' Ḥiyya bar Lulyani, it cites a statement in his name. <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Lulyani taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 92:13)? <b>If it is stated “palm tree” why does it state “cedar, ” and if it is stated “cedar” why does it state “palm tree”? </b> What is added by this double comparison?

| Psalms 92:15 | With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age” | Kiddushin 82a:10 | The Mishnah explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for YHWH shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old, </b> well stricken in age; <b>and YHWH had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result. |
| Psalms 92:15 | his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be full of sap and richness” | Kiddushin 82b:5 | The Mishnah taught that <b>R' Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades</b> and I teach my son only Torah. It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:14): <b>R' Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as all other trades serve one only in the days of his youth, </b> when he has enough strength to work, <b>but in the days of his old age, behold, he</b> is left to <b>lie in hunger. But Torah is not like this: It serves a person in the time of his youth and provides him with a future and hope in the time of his old age. With regard to the time of his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for YHWH shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to</b> the time of <b>his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be full of sap and richness”</b> (Psalms 92:15). |
| Psalms 93:1 | “The Lord reigns; He is clothed in majesty” | Avodah Zarah24b:17 | <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that it was the Psalm beginning: <b>“YHWH reigns; He is clothed in majesty”</b> (Psalms 93:1). <b>R' Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: </b> They did not recite a verse found in the Bible, but rather, the following song: <b>Sing, sing, acacia; ascend in all your glory; overlaid with golden embroidery, exalted by the book [<i>devir</i>] of the palace, and magnificent with jewels. </b> The song alludes to the Ark of the Covenant, which was made of acacia wood and covered with gold. The expression: Book of the palace, is a reference to the Torah scroll that was placed in the Ark. |
| Psalms 93:1 | “The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty” | Rosh Hashanah31a:5 | <b>On the 5th</b> day of the week the Levites <b>would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength”</b> (Psalms 81:2), <b>because</b> on the 5th day of Creation <b>He created birds and fish to praise His name.

| Psalms 93:2 | as it is written: “Your throne is established of old, | Nedarim 39b:9 | <b>The Throne of Glory</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Your throne is established of old, </b> You are from everlasting” (Psalms 93:2). |
| Psalms 93:4 | among them, as it is stated: “The Lord on high is mighty [ adir ]” | Beitzah 15b:19 | Apropos the statement attributed to R' Yoḥanan in the name of R' Eliezer ben Shimon, the Talmud cites another statement that <b>R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Eliezer ben Shimon: One who wants his properties to be preserved</b> and protected from ruin should <b>plant an <i>eder</i></b> tree <b>among them, as it is stated: “YHWH on high is mighty [<i>adir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). Due to the similarity of the words <i>eder</i> and <i>adir</i>, this is understood to mean that the <i>eder</i> tree bestows permanence. |
| Psalms 93:4 | Let the Addir come, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord on high is mighty [ addir ]” | Menachot 53a:18 | R' Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>Addir</i> in the phrase: <b>Let the <i>Addir</i> come, this is God as it is written: “YHWH on high is mighty [<i>addir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). In the phrase: <b>And exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Jews, as it is stated: “The excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). In the phrase: <b>From the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Egyptians, as it is written</b> with regard to the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“The mighty [<i>addirim</i>] sank as lead in the waters”</b> (Exodus 15:10). In the phrase: <b>In the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the waters, as it is stated: “Above the voices of many waters, the mighty [<i>addirim</i>] breakers of the sea”</b> (Psalms 93:4). |
| Psalms 93:5 | Rabbi Ḥagga was walking up the stairs in the school of Rabba bar Sheila. He heard a certain child who said: “Your testimonies are very sure; sanctity becomes Your house, Lord, for the length of days” | Sanhedrin 111b:2 | The Talmud relates: <b>R' Ḥagga was walking up the stairs in the school of Rabba bar Sheila. He heard a certain child who said: “Your testimonies are very sure; sanctity becomes Your house, Lord, for the length of days”</b> (Psalms 93:5). The phrase “length of days” is a reference to the attribute of slow to anger. <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the phrase: <b>“A prayer of Moses”</b> (Psalms 90:1), indicating that this chapter was also stated by Moses our teacher. Upon hearing those verses, R' Ḥagga <b>said: Conclude from it</b> that it was the attribute of <b>slow to anger</b> that Moses <b>saw. </b> |
| Psalms 94:1 | revenge that was placed between two letters, as it is stated: “God of vengeance, Lord, | Berakhot 33a:22 | <b>Rav Aḥa Karḥina’a strongly objects to this</b> approach that being placed between two names of God accords significance: <b>However, if so, </b> the same should hold true for vengeance. <b>Great</b> is <b>revenge that was placed between two letters, as it is stated: “God of vengeance, Lord, </b> God of vengeance shine forth” (Psalms 94:1). |
| Psalms 94:1 | in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth” | Berakhot 58b:1 | <b>A baraita states: One who sees the houses of Israel inhabited</b> and tranquil <b>recites: Blessed…Who establishes the border of the widow. </b> One who sees them <b>in ruins he recites: Blessed…the true Judge. </b> One who sees <b>the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “YHWH will destroy the house of the proud, </b> but He will establish the border of the widow” (Proverbs 15:25). <b>And</b> if he sees them <b>in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1). |
| Psalms 94:1 | “O Lord God, to Whom vengeance belongs” | Rosh Hashanah31a:4 | <b>On the 3rd</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“God stands in the congregation of God”</b> (Psalms 82:1), <b>because</b> on the 3rd day of Creation <b>He revealed the land in His wisdom and</b> thereby <b>prepared the world for His assembly</b> that could now live on the dry land. <b>On the 4th</b> day of the week <b>they would recite</b> the psalm beginning: <b>“O Lord God, to Whom vengeance belongs”</b> (Psalms 94:1), <b>because</b> on the 4th day of Creation <b>He created the sun and the moon, and in the future He will punish</b> and take vengeance upon <b>those who worship them. </b> |
| Psalms 94:1 | vengeance, as it was placed between two letters, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth” | Sanhedrin 92a:8 | <b>And R' Elazar says: Great is the Holy Temple, as it</b> too <b>was placed between two letters, </b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated: </b> “The place in which to dwell that <b>You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, which Your hands have prepared”</b> (Exodus 15:17). <b>Rav Adda Karḥina’a objects to</b> the explanation that being placed between two names of God accords significance. <b>If that is so, </b> the same should hold true for vengeance. Shall one say: <b>Great</b> is <b>vengeance, as it was placed between two letters, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1)? |
| Psalms 94:1 | these two appearances: | Sanhedrin 92a:9 | R' Elazar <b>said to him: In its context, indeed, </b> vengeance is great, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ulla. As Ulla says</b> with regard to <b>these two appearances: </b> “O Lord, God to Whom vengeance belongs; God to Whom vengeance belongs, appear” (Psalms 94:1), and: “He appeared from Mount Paran” (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>why</b> are both necessary? <b>One, </b> the second verse, is necessary <b>for the attribute of</b> divine <b>good, </b> with which God gave the Torah at Sinai, <b>and one, </b> the first verse, is necessary <b>for the attribute of</b> divine <b>punishment, </b> with which God exacts vengeance against the enemies and oppressors of the Jewish people. |
| Psalms 94:7 | And it is written: “And they say: The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed” | Bava Kamma79b:8 | <b>As it were, </b> the thief <b>establishes the eye below, </b> i.e., God’s eye, <b>as though it does not see, and the ear below, </b> i.e., God’s ear, <b>as though it does not hear. </b> The Talmud cites verses that describe people who imagine that God does not see their actions, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from YHWH, and their works are in the dark, </b> and they say: Who sees us, and who knows us? ” (Isaiah 29:15). <b>And it is written: “And they say: YHWH will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed”</b> (Psalms 94:7). <b>And it is written: “For they say: YHWH has forsaken the land, and YHWH does not see”</b> (Ezekiel 9:9). |
| Psalms 94:8 | what would they say? “Consider [ binu ], you brutish among the people” | Sukkah 55a:5 | <b>On the 4th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “Consider [<i>binu</i>], you brutish among the people”</b> (Psalms 94:8). <b>On the 5th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “I removed [<i>hasiroti</i>] his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). <b>On the 6th</b> day, <b>what would they say? “All the foundations of the earth are moved [<i>yimotu</i>]”</b> (Psalms 82:5). <b>And if Shabbat occurred on any</b> of the intermediate days of the Festival, since Shabbat has its own song (Psalms 92), the last of the songs of the intermediate days, i.e., “All the foundations of the earth <b>are moved, ” is superseded, </b> and all the other songs are recited in their proper sequence. |
| Psalms 94:9 | He who created this did not create that; as it is stated: “He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?” | Sanhedrin 39a:8 | If you will claim that different gods created different parts of Adam, that will not suffice. <b>A person has one handbreadth by one handbreadth</b> of facial countenance, with <b>two</b> types of <b>orifices in it, </b> eyes and ears. Should one say that <b>He who created this did not create that; as it is stated: “He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see? ”</b> (Psalms 94:9)? The verse employs two verbs for the eyes and ears alone. The emperor <b>said to him: Yes, </b> different gods created different parts of the face. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: And at the moment of death, are they all appeased? </b> Do all these gods agree as one that the time arrived for the person to die? |
| Psalms 94:12 | as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law” | Berakhot 5a:9 | Previously, the Talmud discussed suffering that results from one’s transgressions. The Talmud shifts the focus and discusses suffering that does not result from one’s transgressions and the suffering of the righteous. <b>Rava, and some say Rav Ḥisda, said: If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his actions. </b> Generally, suffering comes about as punishment for one’s transgressions, <b>as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God”</b> (Lamentations 3:40). <b>If he examined</b> his ways and <b>found no</b> transgression for which that suffering is appropriate, <b>he may attribute</b> his suffering <b>to dereliction</b> in the study <b>of Torah. </b> God punishes an individual for dereliction in the study of Torah in order to emphasize the gravity of the issue, <b>as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law”</b> (Psalms 94:12). This verse teaches us that his suffering will cause him to return to Your law. |
| Psalms 94:16 | And the Holy One, Blessed be He, was saying: “Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of iniquity?” | Sotah 13b:23 | He answers: The contradiction between the two verses <b>teaches that Moses was lying in the wings of the Shekhina, </b> as Moses was carried out by God Himself, <b>and the ministering angels were saying: “He executed the righteousness of YHWH, and His ordinances with Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21). <b>And God was saying: “Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of iniquity? ”</b> (Psalms 94:16). In other words, God asked: Who will now defend the Jewish people against its accusers? The idea that God Himself transported Moses to his burial could not have been said if not for the proof from the resolution between the contradictory verses. |
| Psalms 94:16 | “Who [ mi ] will rise up for me against the evildoers?” | Sukkah 55a:4 | <b>And furthermore, </b> contrary to the statement of R' Aḥa, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the intermediate days of the Festival, on the first</b> day, <b>what would they say</b> as the song accompanying the offering on that day? <b>“Ascribe [<i>havu</i>] unto YHWH, O you sons of might”</b> (Psalms 29:1). <b>On the second</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm that contains the verse: <b>“But unto the wicked [<i>velarasha</i>] God says: </b> What have you to do to declare My statutes? ” (Psalms 50:16). <b>On the 3rd</b> day, <b>what would they say? </b> The psalm containing the verse: <b>“Who [<i>mi</i>] will rise up for me against the evildoers? ”</b> (Psalms 94:16). |
| Psalms 94:23 | “And He brought upon them their own iniquity, and He will cut them off in their own evil” | Arakhin 11b:17 | As the rabbis <b>said: When the Temple was destroyed for the first</b> time, <b>that day was the 9th of Av, </b> a date on which several calamities had already occurred; <b>and it was the conclusion of Shabbat, </b> i.e., it was on the day after Shabbat, a Sunday; <b>and it was the year after a Sabbatical</b> Year; <b>and it was the week of the priestly watch of Jehoiarib; and the priests and Levites were standing on their platform and singing song.

| Psalms 94:23 | is brought about on an auspicious day, | Arakhin 12a:2 | The Talmud seeks to resolve the dilemma through a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: R' Yosei says</b> that <b>a fortunate</b> matter <b>is brought about on an auspicious day, </b> and a deleterious matter on an inauspicious day, e.g., the 9th of Av, on which several tragedies have already occurred.

| Psalms 95:5 | “And His hands formed the dry land” | Ketubot 5a:12 | <b>A certain Babylonian, and his name is R' Ḥiyya, responded</b> with a challenge. It is written with regard to creation of the earth: <b>“And His hands formed the dry land”</b> (Psalms 95:5). The Talmud answers: <b>“His hand”</b> is the way it <b>is written. </b> Although the word is vocalized in the plural, it is written in the singular, without the letter <i>yod</i>. <b>But isn’t it written: “Formed, ”</b> in the plural? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The plural is referring to <b>His fingers, as it is written: “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars, which You have established”</b> (Psalms 8:4). |
| Psalms 95:7 | “today, if you will listen to his voice” | Sanhedrin 98a:17 | R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>went to</b> the Messiah. <b>He said to</b> the Messiah: <b>Greetings to you, my R' and my teacher. </b> The Messiah <b>said to him: Greetings to you, bar Leva’i. </b> R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him: When will the Master come? </b> The Messiah <b>said to him: Today. </b> Sometime later, R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>came to Elijah. </b> Elijah <b>said to him: What did</b> the Messiah <b>say to you?

R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to</b> Elijah: The Messiah <b>lied to me, as he said to me: I am coming today, and he did not come. </b> Elijah <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he said to you: </b> He said that he will come <b>“today, if you will listen to his voice”</b> (Psalms 95:7). |
| Psalms 95:10 | as it is stated: “Forty years will I strive with the generation” | Sanhedrin 99a:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer says: The messianic era will be forty years</b> long, <b>as it is stated: “Forty years will I strive with the generation”</b> (Psalms 95:10). The forty years of strife with the non-Jews will be followed by the glory days of the Messiah. <b>R' Elazar ben Azarya says: </b> The messianic era will last <b>seventy years, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king”</b> (Isaiah 23:15). In this context, one [<i>eḥad</i>], means unique [<i>meyuḥad</i>]. <b>Which is</b> the <b>unique king? You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> a reference to the <b>Messiah. </b> |
| Psalms 95:11 | have something to support them, as it is stated: “Wherefore I swore in My wrath” | Chagigah 10a:7 | <b>R' Yehoshua</b> likewise <b>says: </b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “Wherefore I swore in My wrath”</b> (Psalms 95:11), meaning: <b>In my wrath I swore, and I retracted. </b> This is the basis for the dissolution of vows, in which the one who uttered the vow tells the Sage that he regrets it, as he did so in a moment of anger. |
| Psalms 95:11 | “Wherefore I took an oath in My anger that they should not enter into My rest” | Sanhedrin 110b:2 | § The Mishnah teaches: The members of <b>the generation of the wilderness have no share in the World-to-Come. A baraita states: </b> The members of <b>the generation of the wilderness have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die”</b> (Numbers 14:35). <b>“They shall be consumed”</b> indicates <b>in this world; “and there they shall die”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come. And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the generation of the wilderness: <b>“Wherefore I took an oath in My anger that they should not enter into My rest”</b> (Psalms 95:11), indicating that they will not be privileged to gain eternal rest; this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. </b> |
| Psalms 97:11 | “Light is sown for the righteous” | Taanit 15a:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I too say</b> a similar idea. <b>Not all</b> are fit <b>for light, and not all</b> are fit <b>for gladness.

The righteous</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with light, </b> as it is written: <b>“Light is sown for the righteous”</b> (Psalms 97:11), <b>and the upright</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with gladness, as it is written, </b> in the same verse: <b>“And gladness for the upright in heart. ”</b> |
| Psalms 98:1 | “A Psalm. O sing unto the Lord a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand, and His holy arm, have wrought salvation for Him” | Avodah Zarah24b:16 | <b>And R' Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that it was <b>an orphaned psalm, </b> i.e., a psalm whose author and the event to which it makes reference are not specified. The psalm begins with: <b>“A Psalm. O sing unto YHWH a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand, and His holy arm, have wrought salvation for Him”</b> (Psalms 98:1). <b>R' Elazar says</b> that it was the psalm beginning with: <b>“YHWH reigns; let the peoples tremble”</b> (Psalms 99:1). |
| Psalms 98:3 | “He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God” | Megillah 11a:3 | <b>R' Yoḥanan introduced this passage with an introduction from here: </b> The verse states: <b>“He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God”</b> (Psalms 98:3). <b>When did all the ends of the earth see the salvation of our God? In the days of Mordecai and Esther, </b> for their peril and salvation became known through the letters sent throughout the empire. |
| Psalms 98:6 | As it is written: “With trumpets and the sound of a shofar make joyful noise before the Lord, the King” | Rosh Hashanah27a:14 | <b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi</b> that said: <b>What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written: “With trumpets and the sound of a <i>shofar</i> make joyful noise before YHWH, the King”</b> (Psalms 98:6), from which it may be inferred: Only <b>before YHWH, the King, </b> i.e., in His Temple, <b>do we need</b> both <b>trumpets and the sound of a <i>shofar</i>, but in general, </b> outside the Temple, we do <b>not</b> need both. |
| Psalms 99:1 | “The Lord reigns; let the peoples tremble” | Avodah Zarah24b:16 | <b>And R' Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that it was <b>an orphaned psalm, </b> i.e., a psalm whose author and the event to which it makes reference are not specified. The psalm begins with: <b>“A Psalm.

| Psalms 99:1 | Kingship, for example: “The Lord reigns, let the peoples tremble” | Rosh Hashanah32b:3 | The Talmud qualifies the Mishnah’s ruling. <b>However, if one comes to recite</b> verses of <b>Kingship, remembrance, and <i>shofar</i></b> with a theme <b>of the punishment of non-Jews, one may recite</b> them. The Talmud offers examples of these verses: With regard to the verses of <b>Kingship, for example: “YHWH reigns, let the peoples tremble”</b> (Psalms 99:1), <b>and, for example: “YHWH is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land”</b> (Psalms 10:16). With regard to <b>remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom</b> the day of Jerusalem, who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). With regard to the verses of <b><i>shofar</i>, for example: “And YHWH God will sound the</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>and will go with whirlwinds of the south”</b> (Zechariah 9:14), <b>and it is written: “YHWH of hosts will defend them”</b> (Zechariah 9:15), i.e., God will defend the Jewish people against their enemies. |
| Psalms 99:6 | men. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. As it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name” | Berakhot 31b:17 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“an offspring of men”? Rav said: </b> Hannah prayed for <b>a man among men, </b> a son who would be outstanding and exceptional. <b>And Shmuel said: </b> This expression means <b>an offspring who will anoint two men</b> to royalty. <b>And who were they? Saul and David. And R' Yoḥanan said: </b> Hannah prayed that she would bear <b>an offspring who</b> would be <b>the equivalent of two</b> of the world’s greatest <b>men. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. As it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). In this verse, Hannah’s son, Samuel, is equated to Moses and Aaron. <b>And the Rabbis say: “An offspring of men”: </b> Hannah prayed for <b>an offspring who would be inconspicuous among men, </b> that he would not stand out in any way. |
| Psalms 99:6 | “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name; | Rosh Hashanah25b:1 | <b>And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name; </b> they called upon YHWH, and He answered them” (Psalms 99:6). This verse equates Samuel to Moses and Aaron. In this manner, <b>the verse weighed three light ones of the world, </b> i.e., it considered the three less distinguished figures of Gideon, Samson, and Jephthah <b>as</b> equal to <b>three significant ones of the world, </b> Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, three of the greatest leaders of the Jewish people. |
| Psalms 99:6 | me the equivalent of Moses and Aaron, as it is written: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His Name” | Taanit 5b:4 | R' Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>R' Yoḥanan said as follows: Old age sprang upon</b> Samuel, which caused him to appear older than his actual age, <b>as it is written: “I regret that I made Saul king”</b> (I Samuel 15:11). Samuel <b>said before</b> God: <b>God!, You have</b> considered <b>me the equivalent of Moses and Aaron, as it is written: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His Name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>Moses and Aaron, their handiwork was not annulled in their lifetimes, so too, let my handiwork not be annulled in my lifetime. </b> I anointed Saul; please do not annul his reign. |
| Psalms 99:6 | states: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, | Zevachim 102a:8 | <b>And the Rabbis say: Moses became a priest</b> for <b>the seven days of inauguration alone, </b> and after that his priesthood expired. <b>And some say: </b> The <b>priesthood expired only for the descendants of Moses, </b> but Moses himself remained a priest, <b>as it is stated: “But as for Moses the man of God, his sons are named among the tribe of Levi”</b> (I Chronicles 23:14). This verse indicates that it was his sons who were Levites, but he himself remained a priest. <b>And</b> so too the verse <b>states: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, </b> did call upon YHWH, and He answered them” (Psalms 99:6). |
| Psalms 100:1 | isn’t it written: “A psalm of thanksgiving [ toda ]” | Sanhedrin 43a:26 | Then <b>they brought Toda in</b> to stand trial. Toda <b>said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Toda be executed? </b> But <b>isn’t it written: “A psalm of thanksgiving [<i>toda</i>]”</b> (Psalms 100:1)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Toda shall be executed, as it is written: “Whoever slaughters a thanks-offering [<i>toda</i>] honors Me”</b> (Psalms 50:23). |
| Psalms 101:1 | “I will sing of loving-kindness and justice; unto You, O Lord, will I sing praises” | Berakhot 60b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa said in the name of R' Levi: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“I will sing of loving-kindness and justice; unto You, O Lord, will I sing praises”</b> (Psalms 101:1). Rav Aḥa explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>loving-kindness, I will sing, and if</b> it is <b>justice, I will sing. </b> I will thank God in song for the bad just as for the good. |
| Psalms 101:5 | I will destroy him [ atzmit ]” | Arakhin 15b:12 | <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech, </b> it is <b>appropriate to stone him with stones. It is written here: </b> “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, <b>I will destroy him [<i>atzmit</i>]”</b> (Psalms 101:5), <b>and it is written there: “They have destroyed [<i>tzamtu</i>] my life in the dungeon, and have cast stones upon me”</b> (Lamentations 3:53). |
| Psalms 101:5 | “Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him; whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” | Arakhin 15b:13 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, God says</b> about him: <b>He and I cannot dwell</b> together <b>in the world. As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him; whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him”</b> (Psalms 101:5). <b>Do not read</b> the phrase as: <b>“I will not suffer him [</b><i>oto</i><b>], ” but</b> as: <b>With him [<i>ito</i>] I cannot</b> bear to dwell. God is saying that He cannot bear having this person in the world with Him. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach this</b> notion of God’s not being able to tolerate a certain type of person in reference <b>to the arrogant, </b> i.e., they apply it to the last part of the verse: Proud of heart. |
| Psalms 101:5 | leprous marks coming upon him, as it is stated: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him [ atzmit ]; | Arakhin 15b:7 | <b>And R' Yosei ben Zimra says: Anyone who speaks malicious speech</b> will be afflicted by <b>leprous marks coming upon him, as it is stated: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him [<i>atzmit</i>]; </b> whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” (Psalms 101:5). <b>And it is written there: </b> “And the land shall not be sold <b>in perpetuity [<i>letzmitut</i>]; </b> for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and settlers with Me” (Leviticus 25:23). <b>And we translate</b> this term <i>letzmitut</i> as <b><i>laḥalutin</i>, </b> in perpetuity or confirmed. |
| Psalms 101:5 | as it is written: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him; | Arakhin 16a:6 | The Talmud explains the source for the claim that each of these seven sins is punishable with tzara'at. <b>For malicious speech</b> one is punished, <b>as it is written: “Whoever defames his neighbor in secret, I will destroy him; </b> whoever is haughty of eye and proud of heart, I will not suffer him” (Psalms 101:5). The Talmud explained above (15b) that this is referring to tzara'at. |
| Psalms 101:6 | as it is stated: “My eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me; | Tamid 28a:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Which</b> way of life <b>is an upright path that a person should select for himself; </b> what should be his guiding principle? One <b>should love admonition, for as long as</b> statements of <b>admonition</b> from the wise are heard <b>in the world, pleasantness comes into the world, goodness and blessing come into the world, and evil departs from the world, as it is stated: “But to those who admonish shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them”</b> (Proverbs 24:25). <b>And some say: </b> The path one <b>should</b> select is to <b>adhere to utmost faithfulness</b> in business and interpersonal sex, <b>as it is stated: “My eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me; </b> he who walks in a way of integrity, he shall serve Me” (Psalms 101:6). |
| Psalms 101:7 | because it is stated: “He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before My eyes” | Chagigah 14b:8 | § <b>A baraita states: Four entered the orchard [<i>pardes</i>], </b> i.e., dealt with the loftiest secrets of Torah, <b>and they are as follows: Ben Azzai; and ben Zoma; <i>Aḥer</i>, </b> the other, a name for Elisha ben Avuya; <b>and R' Akiva. R' Akiva, </b> the senior among them, <b>said to them: When, </b> upon your arrival in the upper worlds, <b>you reach pure marble stones, do not say: Water, water, </b> although they appear to be water, <b>because it is stated: “He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7). |
| Psalms 101:7 | as so it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes” | Sanhedrin 102b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>“go out”</b> that God instructed the spirit? <b>Ravina says</b> that it means: <b>Go out from</b> within <b>my partition</b> and do not return, <b>as so it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7). The spirit that volunteered to lie may no longer be before God. <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: One who avenges</b> due to <b>his zealotry destroys his</b> own <b>house. </b> The spirit of Naboth that sought revenge was expelled from before God. |
| Psalms 101:7 | the group of liars, as it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes” | Sanhedrin 103a:12 | Apropos the previous statement, the Talmud cites an additional statement. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>four groups do not receive the Shekhina: </b> This pertains to <b>the group of cynics, the group of liars, the group of flatterers, </b> and <b>the group of slanderers. </b> This pertains to <b>the group of cynics, as it is written: “He withdrew His hand with cynics”</b> (Hosea 7:5), indicating that God distanced Himself from them. This pertains to <b>the group of liars, as it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7). This pertains to <b>the group of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer shall not come before Him”</b> (Job 13:16). This pertains to <b>the group of slanderers, as it is stated: “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil shall not dwell with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), which means: <b>You are righteous, and there will be no</b> form of <b>evil in Your dwelling. </b> |
| Psalms 101:7 | But perhaps there, the reason is as it is written: “One who speaks lies shall not dwell | Shabbat 149b:7 | <b>And we said: What</b> is this <b>spirit? R' Yoḥanan said: This is the spirit of Naboth</b> the Jezreelite, who asked to avenge his death at the hands of Ahab. <b>And what is</b> the meaning of the words: <b>Go out, </b> which God commanded him? <b>Rav said: </b> It means that he was given permission to entice Ahab, but God said: <b>Leave from</b> within <b>My partition. </b> Therefore, it seems that the spirit of Naboth was told to leave God’s area because it caused Ahab to be punished. The Talmud rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps there, the reason is as it is written: “One who speaks lies shall not dwell</b> before My eyes” (Psalms 101:7), and this is the only reason that the spirit of Naboth was removed from within God’s partition. |
| Psalms 101:7 | the class of liars, as it is written: “He who speaks falsehood shall not dwell before My eyes” | Sotah 42a:5 | The proof for this statement is as follows: <b>The class of cynics, as it is written: “He draws His hand from cynics”</b> (Hosea 7:5), i.e., God does not want to be in their presence; <b>the class of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer cannot come before Him”</b> (Job 13:16); <b>the class of liars, as it is written: “He who speaks falsehood shall not dwell before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7). |
| Psalms 102:1 | in a low place and pray, for there is no haughtiness before God. As it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” and it is written: “A prayer for the impoverished, when he is faint | Berakhot 10b:27 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One should neither stand upon a chair nor upon a stool, nor in a high place and pray. Rather, </b> one should stand <b>in a low place and pray, for there is no haughtiness before God. As it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” and it is written: “A prayer for the impoverished, when he is faint</b> and pours out his complaint before God” (Psalms 102:1). It is appropriate to feel impoverished when praying and make one’s requests humbly. |
| Psalms 102:1 | nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [ siḥo ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 26b:6 | <b>Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field toward evening”</b> (Genesis 24:63), <b>and conversation</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [<i>siḥo</i>] before YHWH”</b> (Psalms 102:1). Obviously, Isaac was the first to pray as evening approached, at the time of the afternoon prayer. |
| Psalms 102:1 | “A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints” | Taanit 15a:7 | <b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before the</b> congregation: The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings, <b>and they are</b> as follows: The special series of blessings recited on Rosh HaShana, the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i>; </b> and the sections of Psalms that begin with the verses: <b>“In my distress I called to YHWH and He answered me”</b> (Psalms 120:1), <b>“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; </b> from where will my help come” (Psalms 121:1), <b>“Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1), and <b>“A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints”</b> (Psalms 102:1). |
| Psalms 102:14 | “You will arise and have compassion upon Zion; | Menachot 87a:18 | The chapter concludes by quoting an additional prophecy of Isaiah concerning the rebuilding of Eretz Yisrael: It <b>is written: “I have set watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day nor night; those who remind YHWH, take no rest”</b> (Isaiah 62:6). This is referring to the angels appointed by God to bring the redemption. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> do these watchmen <b>say</b> to remind YHWH? <b>This</b> is what <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said: </b> They recite the verse: <b>“You will arise and have compassion upon Zion; </b> for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come” (Psalms 102:14). |

Traveling on the <b>road, as it is written: “He has weakened my strength on the road”</b> (Psalms 102:24). <b>Sin, as it is written: “My strength fails because of my sin”</b> (Psalms 31:11). |
| Psalms 103:1 | Bless the Lord, O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name” | Berakhot 10a:13 | <b>He resided in his mother’s womb, </b> his first world, <b>and said a song</b> of praise of the pregnancy, <b>as it is stated: </b> “Of David. <b>Bless YHWH, O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name”</b> (Psalms 103:1), in which he thanks God for creating all that is within his mother, i.e., her womb. |
| Psalms 103:2 | as it is stated: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and do not forget all His benefits [ gemulav ]” | Berakhot 10a:15 | <b>He nursed from his mother’s breast, </b> his 3rd world, <b>and he looked upon her bosom and said a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “Bless YHWH, O my soul, and do not forget all His benefits [<i>gemulav</i>]”</b> (Psalms 103:2). The etymological association is between <i>gemulav</i> and <i>gemulei meḥalav</i>, which means weaned from milk (Isaiah 28:9). |
| Psalms 103:3 | forgives him for all his sins, as it is stated: “Who forgives all your iniquity; Who heals all your diseases” | Nedarim 41a:3 | § <b>R' Alexandri said</b> that <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The sick person recovers from his illness only when</b> the heavenly court <b>forgives him for all his sins, as it is stated: “Who forgives all your iniquity; Who heals all your diseases”</b> (Psalms 103:3). <b>Rav Hamnuna said: </b> When he recovers, <b>he returns to the days of his youth, as it is stated</b> in a verse with regard to one recovering from illness: <b>“His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth”</b> (Job 33:25). Interpreting the verse: “YHWH will support him upon the bed of suffering; <b>You overturned all his lying down in his illness”</b> (Psalms 41:4), <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> That is <b>to say that</b> the sick person <b>forgets his studies, </b> as everything that is organized is overturned. |
| Psalms 103:11 | “For as the heaven is high above the earth” | Menachot 31b:8 | The Talmud explains their dispute: <b>The one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line</b> interprets the verse: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which YHWH swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heaven above the earth,” in a similar manner to the verse: <b>“For as the heaven is high above the earth”</b> (Psalms 103:11). Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the end of the final line, it will appropriately be below the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line. <b>And the one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line</b> explains the phrase “as the days of the heaven above the earth” as meaning: <b>Just as</b> the <b>heaven is far from the earth. </b> Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the beginning of the final line, it is far from the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line. |
| Psalms 103:13 | as it is written: “As a father has compassion for his children” | Sanhedrin 102b:5 | § The Talmud proceeds to discuss the second king enumerated in the Mishnah, Ahab. <b>Ahab [<i>Aḥav</i>], </b> although he was <b>a brother [<i>aḥ</i>] to Heaven, </b> he was <b>a father [<i>av</i>] for idol worship. </b> He was <b>a brother to Heaven, as it is written: “And a brother is born for adversity”</b> (Proverbs 17:17), and in desperate times, he turned to Heaven. He was <b>a father for idolatry. </b> This is the highest level of attachment, <b>as it is written: “As a father has compassion for his children”</b> (Psalms 103:13). |
| Psalms 103:17 | the verse states: “But the kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him” | Sukkah 49b:12 | <b>And R' Elazar said: Anyone who performs charity and justice is</b> considered <b>as though he filled the whole world in its entirety with kindness, as it is stated: “He loves charity and justice; the earth is full of the kindness of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 33:5). <b>Lest you say that anyone who comes to leap</b> and perform an act of kindness may simply <b>leap</b> and do so without scrutiny, <b>the verse states: “How precious is your kindness, O God”</b> (Psalms 36:8). It is a precious and rare occurrence to perform an act of kindness properly. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a God-fearing</b> individual does not always encounter the opportunity to perform acts of kindness. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But the kindness of YHWH is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him”</b> (Psalms 103:17). |
| Psalms 103:20 | “Mighty in strength who fulfill His word, hearkening to the voice of His word” | Kiddushin 40a:1 | <b>soldiers [<i>nosei keisar</i>]</b> who <b>guarded me all night.

| Psalms 103:20 | “We will hear,” a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: Who revealed to my children this secret that the ministering angels use? As it is written: “Bless the Lord, you angels of His, you mighty in strength, that fulfill His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word” | Shabbat 88a:8 | <b>R' Elazar said: When the Jewish people accorded precedence</b> to the declaration <b>“We will do”</b> over <b>“We will hear, ” a bat kol emerged and said to them: Who revealed to my children this secret that the ministering angels use?

| Psalms 104:3 | emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is a carpenter, as it is written: “Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters” | Chullin 60a:4 | § The Talmud recounts: <b>The daughter of the</b> Roman <b>emperor said to R' Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is a carpenter, as it is written: “Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). <b>Tell Him to make for me a distaff, </b> a simple tool used in spinning.

| Psalms 104:3 | other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [ hamekare ] of His chambers in the waters” | Megillah 11a:6 | <b>R' Elazar introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Through laziness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] sink in [<i>yimakh</i>]; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:18). R' Elazar interprets the verse homiletically: <b>Through the laziness of the Jewish people, who did not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>the enemy of God, </b> a euphemism for God Himself, <b>became poor [<i>makh</i>], </b> so that, as it were, He was unable to help them, <b>as <i>makh</i></b> is <b>nothing other than poor, as it is stated: “But if he be too poor [<i>makh</i>] for the valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And</b> the word <b><i>mekare</i></b> in the verse <b>is referring</b> to <b>no</b> one <b>other than God as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of His chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). |
| Psalms 104:3 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [ hamekare ] of Your upper chambers in the water” | Taanit 7b:10 | <b>Rav Ketina said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated: “By slothfulness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] will sink in [<i>yimakh</i>], </b> and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18). <b>Due to slothfulness that was</b> present <b>amongst the Jewish people, that they did not occupy</b> themselves <b>with Torah, the enemy of God, </b> a euphemism for God Himself, has <b>sunk.

| Psalms 104:6 | upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains” | Chagigah 12b:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says: Woe to them, the creations, who see and know not what they see; </b> who <b>stand and know not upon what they stand. </b> He clarifies: <b>Upon what does the earth stand? Upon pillars, as it is stated: “Who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble”</b> (Job 9:6). These <b>pillars</b> are positioned <b>upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters”</b> (Psalms 136:6). These <b>waters</b> stand <b>upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains”</b> (Psalms 104:6). The <b>mountains</b> are upon the <b>wind, as it is stated: “For behold He forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). The <b>wind</b> is <b>upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word”</b> (Psalms 148:8). The <b>storm hangs upon the arm of God as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), which demonstrates that the entire world rests upon the arms of God. |
| Psalms 104:13 | the earth is full of the fruit of Your works” | Taanit 10a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The upper waters</b> do not stand in any defined place; rather, they are <b>suspended by</b> the <b>word</b> of God, <b>and their fruit is rainwater, as it is stated: </b> “Who waters the mountains from His upper chambers; <b>the earth is full of the fruit of Your works”</b> (Psalms 104:13). <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua. And R' Eliezer, </b> how does he explain this verse? R' Eliezer could say: <b>That</b> verse from Psalms <b>is written with regard to the handiwork of God, </b> not the upper waters. |
| Psalms 104:13 | which is written: “Who waters the mountains from His upper chambers” | Taanit 9b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that</b> verse <b>which is written: “Who waters the mountains from His upper chambers”</b> (Psalms 104:13)? <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: </b> This phrase indicates that the water comes <b>from the upper chambers of God.

| Psalms 104:15 | “And wine that makes glad the heart of man” | Avodah Zarah29a:5 | This remedy is beneficial for several ailments, and the Talmud presents each of these in turn: <b>For</b> curing the <b>heart, </b> the above combination should be taken <b>with wine, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). <b>For</b> curing an ailment that arises due to <b>the wind [<i>ruḥa</i>], </b> one drinks the mixture <b>in water, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And the spirit [<i>ruaḥ</i>] of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>For childbirth [<i>lekhuda</i>], </b> a woman in labor drinks the mixture <b>with beer [<i>shikhra</i>], and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“With her pitcher [<i>vekhadah</i>] upon her shoulder [<i>shikhmah</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:15). |
| Psalms 104:15 | and bread fills man’s heart” | Berakhot 35b:19 | Again, the Talmud asks: <b>Does</b> wine <b>satisfy at all? Isn’t it written: “Wine gladdens the heart of man, </b> making the face brighter than oil, <b>and bread fills man’s heart”</b> (Psalms 104:15); <b>bread is that which satisfies, wine does not satisfy. Rather, </b> this verse is not a proof; <b>wine has two</b> advantages, <b>it satisfies and gladdens. Bread, </b> however, <b>satisfies but does not gladden. </b> |
| Psalms 104:15 | for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man” | Berakhot 57a:21 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before R' Yoḥanan taught: One who sees any kind of drink in a dream it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>except for wine, </b> as <b>there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>There is</b> one <b>who drinks</b> wine <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15), <b>and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). |
| Psalms 104:15 | wine, as it is stated: “And wine that gladdens the heart of man” | Pesachim 109a:5 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: When the Temple is standing, rejoicing is only through</b> the eating of sacrificial <b>meat, as it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings and you shall eat there and you shall rejoice before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). <b>And now that the Temple is not standing</b> and one cannot eat sacrificial meat, he can fulfill the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival <b>only by</b> drinking <b>wine, as it is stated: “And wine that gladdens the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). |
| Psalms 104:15 | gladdens | Sanhedrin 70a:15 | <b>Rava raises</b> a similar <b>contradiction: </b> It <b>is written: </b> “And wine that <b>gladdens</b> the heart of man” (Psalms 104:15). The word for gladdens could be read as <i>yeshamaḥ</i>, meaning that wine makes one crazy, <b>but we read</b> it as <b><i>yesamaḥ</i>, </b> gladdens the heart. The matter can be explained as follows: If <b>one merits</b> and drinks a moderate amount the wine <b>gladdens him [<i>mesameḥo</i>], </b> whereas if <b>he does not merit</b> and drinks excessively <b>it makes him crazy [<i>meshamemehu</i>]. And that is what Rava</b> meant when he <b>said: Wine and</b> fragrant <b>spices have made me wise; </b> that is to say, the controlled drinking of wine is beneficial to the drinker. |
| Psalms 104:15 | makes glad [ yishamaḥ ] | Yoma 76b:7 | <b>Rav Kahana raised a contradiction: It is written</b> as <b><i>tirash</i> but we read it <i>tirosh</i>. </b> This should be understood as follows: If <b>one merits</b> and drinks appropriately, <b>he is made a head [<i>rosh</i>]; </b> if <b>one does not merit</b> and does not drink appropriately, <b>he is made poor [<i>rash</i>]. </b> The Talmud comments: <b>This is the same as</b> what <b>Rava</b> said, as <b>Rava raised a contradiction: It is written: </b> “And wine that <b>makes glad [<i>yishamaḥ</i>]</b> the heart of man” (Psalms 104:15) with a <i>shin</i>, but <b>we read it <i>yisamaḥ</i></b> with a <i>sin</i>. This teaches: <b>If one merits, </b> wine <b>makes him happy [<i>same’aḥ</i>]; if one does not merit, </b> it <b>makes him confounded [<i>shamem</i>]. This is</b> the same as <b>what Rava said: Wine and good scents make me wise, </b> meaning that wine benefits one who deserves it. |
| Psalms 104:19 | As it is written: “Who appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its going down” | Rosh Hashanah25a:8 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the house of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, i.e., the house of the heads of the Great Sanhedrin, the source of Rabban Gamliel’s ruling? <b>As it is written: “Who appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its going down”</b> (Psalms 104:19). This verse indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>the sun</b> that <b>knows its going down, </b> i.e., its seasons and the times that it shines are the same every year. In contrast, <b>the moon does not know its going down, </b> as its course is not identical every month. |
| Psalms 104:20 | which is written: “You make darkness and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth” | Bava Metzia83b:3 | With regard to the aforementioned psalm, the Talmud notes: <b>R' Zeira interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You make darkness and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth”</b> (Psalms 104:20)? <b>“You make darkness and it is night”; this</b> is referring to <b>this world, which resembles nighttime. “In which all the beasts of the forest creep forth”; these are the wicked in</b> this world, <b>who resemble a beast of the forest, </b> as the wicked have great influence in this world. |
| Psalms 104:20 | in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth” | Bava Metzia83b:5 | The Talmud relates a story that involves rising early. <b>R' Elazar ben Shimon, found a certain officer [<i>parhagavna</i>] whose</b> responsibility was to <b>arrest thieves. He said to</b> the officer: <b>How are you able</b> to arrest <b>them? Aren’t they likened to beasts, as it is written: </b> “You make darkness and it is night, <b>in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth”</b> (Psalms 104:20)? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say that he said to him</b> a proof <b>from this verse: “He lies in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, </b> he lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him up in his net” (Psalms 10:9). Since the wicked are so devious, <b>perhaps you apprehend the righteous and leave the wicked</b> alone? |
| Psalms 104:21 | He said: “The young lions roar after their prey, | Sanhedrin 59b:23 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is there</b> such a thing as <b>meat that descends from heaven? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, it is like this</b> incident: <b>As R' Shimon ben Ḥalafta was walking along the way, he encountered those lions that were roaring at him, </b> intending to eat him. <b>He said: “The young lions roar after their prey, </b> and seek their food from God” (Psalms 104:21), and they deserve to receive food. <b>Two thighs</b> of an animal <b>descended</b> from heaven <b>for him. </b> The lions <b>ate one</b> of these thighs, <b>and they left</b> the other <b>one. He took it and entered the study hall, </b> and <b>inquired about it: Is this</b> thigh <b>a kosher item or a non-kosher item? </b> The rabbis <b>said to him: </b> Certainly it is kosher, as <b>a non-kosher item does not descend from heaven. </b> |
| Psalms 104:22 | “The sun rises; they slink away and couch in their dens” | Bava Metzia83b:4 | With regard to the World-to-Come, the verse states: <b>“The sun rises; they slink away and couch in their dens”</b> (Psalms 104:22). <b>“The sun rises” for the righteous, </b> and <b>“they slink away, ”</b> i.e., <b>the wicked</b> go <b>to Gehenna. </b> As for the phrase: <b>“And couch in their dens, ”</b> it is interpreted as follows: <b>You will not have a single righteous person who will not have his</b> own <b>residence</b> in the World-to-Come, as <b>befitting his dignity. </b> With regard to the phrase: <b>“Man goes forth to his work, ”</b> it indicates that <b>the righteous go forth to receive their reward. </b> Finally, the phrase: <b>“And to his labor until the evening”</b> (Psalms 104:22), teaches that the verse is referring <b>to one who has completed his labor by the evening, </b> i.e., before the evening of his lifetime, his death. |
| Psalms 104:24 | said: “How great are Your works, O Lord!” | Avodah Zarah20a:10 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who was on a step on the Temple mount, and he saw a certain non-Jew woman who was exceptionally beautiful</b> and <b>said: “How great are Your works, O Lord!”</b> (Psalms 104:24). <b>And R' Akiva too, </b> when he <b>saw the wife of the wicked Turnus Rufus he spat, laughed, and cried. He spat, as she was created from a putrid drop; he laughed, as</b> he foresaw that <b>she was destined to convert and he would marry her; he cried, as this beauty</b> would ultimately <b>be consumed by dirt. </b> |
| Psalms 104:24 | “How great are Your works, O Lord” | Chullin 127a:10 | Apropos the salamander, which was thought to generate from fire, the <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When R' Akiva would reach this verse</b> in Leviticus, he would <b>say</b> in exclamation: <b>“How great are Your works, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 104:24). <b>You have creatures</b> that <b>grow in the sea and you have creatures</b> that <b>grow on land. If those in the sea would ascend to the land they would immediately die. If those that are on land would descend to the sea they would immediately die. </b> |
| Psalms 104:26 | He sits and makes sport with the leviathan, as it is stated: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with” | Avodah Zarah3b:8 | During the <b>3rd</b> set of three hours, God, <b>sits and sustains the entire world, from the horns of wild oxen to the eggs of lice. </b> During the <b>4th</b> three hours, <b>He sits and makes sport with the leviathan, as it is stated: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with”</b> (Psalms 104:26). Evidently, God makes sport every day, not only on that one day. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> in explanation: <b>He makes sport with His creations, </b> just as He sports with the leviathan; <b>He does not make sport of His creations but on that day alone. </b> |
| Psalms 104:26 | it is written: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with” | Bava Batra74b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>There too, </b> with regard to the leviathan, <b>let Him castrate the male and cool the female; </b> why was it necessary to kill the female? The Talmud answers: <b>Fish are unrestrained, </b> and therefore even if the female was cooled, the female would still procreate. The Talmud suggests: <b>And let Him do the opposite, </b> and kill and preserve the male leviathan. The Talmud responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <b>salted female is better; if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that</b> since <b>it is written: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with”</b> (Psalms 104:26), the male must be left alive for sport, because it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to sport <b>with a female. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Here too, </b> with regard to the beasts, <b>let Him</b> preserve the <b>female in salt, </b> instead of cooling it. The Talmud answers: <b>Salted fish is good, </b> but <b>salted meat is not good. </b> |
| Psalms 104:29 | it is written: “You hide Your face, they vanish; You gather Your breath, they perish | Berakhot 10a:20 | The connection between this final praise and the day of death is unclear. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is it inferred</b> that <b>this</b> verse <b>was stated with regard to the day of death? </b> Rabba bar Rav Sheila says: We can derive this <b>from</b> the verses at <b>the end of the matter, </b> where <b>it is written: “You hide Your face, they vanish; You gather Your breath, they perish</b> and return to the dust” (Psalms 104:29). |
| Psalms 104:31 | Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works” | Chullin 60a:10 | § <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: “May the glory of YHWH endure forever; let YHWH rejoice in His works”</b> (Psalms 104:31). <b>This verse was stated by the minister of the world, </b> i.e., the angel charged with overseeing the world. <b>When God said: </b> “Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree bearing fruit <b>after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11), <b>the grasses drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves. </b> |
| Psalms 104:35 | as it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul, Halleluya ” | Berakhot 10a:18 | <b>He witnessed</b> in both vision and reality <b>the downfall of the wicked and he said a song</b> of praise, <b>as it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless YHWH, O my soul, <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 104:35). |
| Psalms 104:35 | as it is written: “Let sins cease from the land” | Berakhot 10a:2 | With regard to the statement of R' Yehuda ben Shimon ben Pazi, that David did not say <i>Halleluya</i> until he saw the downfall of the wicked, the Talmud relates: <b>There were these hooligans in R' Meir’s neighborhood who caused him a great deal of anguish. R' Meir prayed for</b> God to have <b>mercy on them, that they should die. R' Meir’s wife, Berurya, said to him: What is your thinking? </b> On what basis do you pray for the death of these hooligans? Do you base yourself on the verse, <b>as it is written: “Let sins cease from the land”</b> (Psalms 104:35), which you interpret to mean that the world would be better if the wicked were destroyed? But <b>is it written, </b> let <b>sinners</b> cease? ” Let <b>sins</b> cease, <b>is written. </b> One should pray for an end to their transgressions, not for the demise of the transgressors themselves. |
| Psalms 104:35 | As it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, my soul, Halleluya ” | Berakhot 9b:29 | The Talmud cites proof that the first two chapters are in fact a single chapter. <b>As R' Yehuda ben Shimon ben Pazi, said: David said one hundred and three chapters, and he did not say <i>Halleluya</i></b> in any of them <b>until he saw the downfall of the wicked. </b> Only then could David say <i>Halleluya</i> wholeheartedly. <b>As it is stated: “Let sinners cease from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless YHWH, my soul, <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 104:35). |
| Psalms 105:8 | before the creation of the world, but they were not created. | Chagigah 14a:1 | <b>before the creation of the world, but they were not created. </b> The Torah was supposed to have been given a thousand generations after the world was created, as it is written: “He commanded His word for a thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8), but God gave it earlier, after only twenty-six generations, so that nine-hundred and seventy-four generations should have been created but were not. <b>God acted by planting</b> a few of <b>them in each and every generation, and they are the insolent ones of the generation, </b> as they belonged to generations that should not have been created at all. |
| Psalms 105:8 | You seek to give it to flesh and blood? | Shabbat 88b:7 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses ascended on High</b> to receive the Torah, <b>the ministering angels said before God: God!, what is one born of a woman</b> doing here <b>among us? </b> God, <b>said to them: He came to receive the Torah. </b> The angels <b>said before Him: </b> The Torah is a <b>hidden treasure that was concealed by You 974 generations before the creation of the world, </b> and <b>You seek to give it to flesh and blood? </b> As it is stated: “The word which He commanded to a thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8). Since the Torah, the word of God, was given to the twenty-6th generation after Adam, the first man, the remaining 974 generations must have preceded the creation of the world. <b>“What is man that You are mindful of him and the son of man that You think of him? ”</b> (Psalms 8:5). Rather, <b>“God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth that Your majesty is placed above the heavens”</b> (Psalms 8:2). The rightful place of God’s majesty, the Torah, is in the heavens. |
| Psalms 106:2 | we will say to him: “Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, shall make all His praises heard?” | Horayot 13b:13 | <b>R' Meir said to R' Natan: I am</b> the <b><i>Ḥakham</i> and you are</b> the <b>deputy <i>Nasi</i>. Let us devise a matter</b> and do to him <b>as he did to us. What shall we do to him? Let us say to him: Reveal</b> to us tractate <b><i>Okatzim</i>, which he does not</b> know. <b>And once</b> it is clear to all <b>that he did not learn, </b> he will not have anything to say. Then <b>we will say to him: “Who can express the mighty acts of YHWH, shall make all His praises heard? ”</b> (Psalms 106:2), indicating: <b>For whom is it becoming to express the mighty acts of YHWH? </b> It is becoming for <b>one who is capable of making all His praises heard, </b> and not for one who does not know one of the tractates. <b>We will remove him</b> from his position as <i>Nasi</i>, <b>and I will be deputy <i>Nasi</i> and you</b> will be <b><i>Nasi</i>. </b> |
| Psalms 106:2 | which is written: “Who can express the mighty acts of God, or make all His praise heard” | Makkot 10a:17 | The next phrase in that verse: <b>“Nor he who loves abundance with increase, ”</b> is also interpreted as referring to Torah: <b>For whom is it fitting to teach an abundance</b> of people? <b>One</b> for <b>whom all</b> its <b>increase belongs to him, </b> i.e., one who knows all the content of the Torah is worthy of teaching it in public. <b>And that is</b> identical to that <b>which R' Elazar says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who can express the mighty acts of God, or make all His praise heard”</b> (Psalms 106:2)? <b>For whom is it fitting to express the mighty acts of God? </b> It is <b>one who can make all His praise heard. </b> One who knows only part of it is unfit to teach the multitudes. |
| Psalms 106:2 | which is written: “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can declare all His praise?” | Megillah 18a:9 | The Talmud comments: These nineteen blessings are a fixed number, and <b>beyond this it is prohibited</b> for one <b>to declare the praises of God, </b> by adding additional blessings to the <i>Amida</i>. As <b>R' Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who can utter the mighty acts of YHWH? Who can declare all His praise? ”</b> (Psalms 106:2)? It means: <b>For whom is it fitting to utter the mighty acts of YHWH? </b> Only <b>for one who can declare all His praise. </b> And since no one is capable of declaring all of God’s praises, we must suffice with the set formula established by the rabbis. |
| Psalms 106:3 | “Happy are they who keep justice, who perform charity at all times” | Ketubot 50a:12 | The Talmud discusses a point related to one of the ordinances of Usha. The verse states: <b>“Happy are they who keep justice, who perform charity at all times”</b> (Psalms 106:3). <b>But is it possible to perform charity at all times? </b> Is one always in the presence of paupers? Therefore, <b>our Rabbis in Yavne taught, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Eliezer: This is</b> referring to <b>one who sustains his sons and daughters when they are minors. </b> As stated above, he is not formally obligated to support them, and therefore when he does so, it is a form of charity that he gives on a constant basis. <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: This is</b> referring to <b>one who raises an orphan boy or an orphan girl in his house, </b> takes care of them, <b>and marries them off. </b> |
| Psalms 106:4 | for good, for example: “Remember me, O Lord, when You show favor to Your people” | Rosh Hashanah32b:4 | The Talmud states: <b>One does not recite</b> a verse dealing with <b>the remembrance of an individual, even</b> if it is <b>for good, for example: “Remember me, O Lord, when You show favor to Your people”</b> (Psalms 106:4), <b>and, for example: “Remember me, my God, for good”</b> (Nehemiah 5:19). |
| Psalms 106:4 | David also said: “Remember me, Lord, when You show favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation” | Sanhedrin 93b:16 | § Apropos books of the Bible named for a prominent person, the Talmud asks: <b>Now</b> with regard to <b>all the matters of</b> the book of <b>Ezra, Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, said them</b> and wrote most of them; <b>and</b> with regard to <b>Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, what is the reason</b> that <b>a book was not called by his name? </b> Over the course of many generations, extending many years after the talmudic period, the book that is today named for Nehemiah was not a separate book and was included in the book of Ezra. <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba says: </b> The book was not named for Nehemiah <b>because he took credit for himself</b> and boasted about his good deeds, <b>as it is stated: “Remember me, God, for good”</b> (Nehemiah 13:31). The Talmud asks: Is that a shortcoming? King <b>David also said: “Remember me, Lord, when You show favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation”</b> (Psalms 106:4). The Talmud answers: <b>David was asking for compassion</b> and formulated his words as a prayer. Nehemiah stated them as a fact and a demand. |
| Psalms 106:6 | “We have sinned along with our forefathers, we have done wrong, we have performed evil” | Yoma 36b:7 | <b>Rather, this is</b> the manner in which <b>he confesses: I have sinned, I have done wrong, and I have rebelled before You, I and my household. And likewise, with regard to David it says</b> in this sequence: <b>“We have sinned along with our forefathers, we have done wrong, we have performed evil”</b> (Psalms 106:6). <b>And likewise, with regard to Solomon it says: “We have sinned, and we have done wrong, we have done evil”</b> (I Kings 8:47). <b>And likewise, with regard to Daniel it says: “We have sinned, and we have done wrong, and we have done evil, and we have rebelled”</b> (Daniel 9:5). <b>However, </b> according to this interpretation, <b>what is</b> the rationale for the sequence of that <b>which Moses said: Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin, </b> where sin appears last? <b>Moses said before God: God!, when the Jewish people sin before you and repent, render their intentional sins like unwitting ones, </b> forgive wrongdoing and rebellion as if they were sin. |
| Psalms 106:7 | which is written: “But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea” | Pesachim 118b:2 | <b>R' Natan says: “And the truth of YHWH endures forever”</b> was actually <b>recited by the fish in the sea, in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Rav Huna. </b> As <b>Rav Huna said: The Jewish people of that generation, </b> during the Exodus, <b>were of little faith. And</b> this statement <b>is as Rabba bar Mari taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea”</b> (Psalms 106:7)? This <b>teaches that the Jews rebelled</b> against Moses <b>at that time, and said: </b> Perhaps, <b>just as we</b> are <b>ascending from one side, so too the Egyptians</b> are <b>ascending from</b> the <b>other side, </b> and we will not be saved. |
| Psalms 106:16 | “And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, of Aaron the Lord’s holy one” | Moed Katan18b:18 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge from a different source: The verse states: <b>“And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, of Aaron YHWH’s holy one”</b> (Psalms 106:16). <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: </b> This verse <b>teaches that every man warned his wife</b> against seclusion <b>with Moses</b> because he was jealous. This implies that every man thought that his wife had secluded herself with Moses and sinned, although this was certainly not the case. This demonstrates that it is possible to suspect an absolutely innocent person. The Talmud answers: <b>There they did it out of hatred</b> for Moses. They did not actually suspect him of wrongdoing. Instead, their goal was to degrade him by leveling these false accusations against him. |
| Psalms 106:16 | with a married woman, as it is stated: “And they were jealous of Moses in the camp” | Sanhedrin 110a:5 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And Moses heard and he fell on his face”</b> (Numbers 16:4), the Talmud asks: <b>What report did he hear</b> that elicited that reaction? <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>R' Yonatan says: </b> He heard <b>that they suspected him</b> of adultery <b>with a married woman, as it is stated: “And they were jealous of Moses in the camp”</b> (Psalms 106:16). <b>R' Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says: </b> This <b>teaches that each and every</b> man <b>warned his wife</b> to distance herself <b>from Moses</b> and not enter into seclusion with him, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp”</b> (Exodus 33:7). It was due to this slander that he withdrew from the camp. |
| Psalms 106:23 | is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them” | Berakhot 10b:12 | The Talmud cites proof from Moses. When he prayed to God for forgiveness after the incident of the Golden Calf, <b>he based</b> his request <b>upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, </b> to whom You swore upon Yourself, and told them: I will increase your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants and they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13). Yet when this story is related, God’s forgiveness of Israel <b>is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them”</b> (Psalms 106:23). |
| Psalms 106:23 | is conquered, he is sad; however, when the Holy One, Blessed be He, is conquered, He rejoices, as it is stated: “Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, | Pesachim 119a:4 | <b>Come and see how the characteristics of God are unlike the characteristics of flesh and blood: When a flesh and blood</b> person <b>is conquered, he is sad; however, when God is conquered, He rejoices, as it is stated: “Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, </b> to turn back His wrath lest He should destroy them” (Psalms 106:23). In this verse Moses is called “His chosen,” although he defeated God, as it were, by preventing Him from destroying the Jewish people. |
| Psalms 106:28 | as it is written: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead” | Avodah Zarah29b:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the prohibition with regard to <b>an offering itself? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). This verse teaches that <b>just as</b> deriving <b>benefit from a corpse is prohibited, so too, </b> deriving <b>benefit from an offering</b> of idolatry <b>is prohibited. </b> |
| Psalms 106:28 | As it is stated: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead” | Avodah Zarah32b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an idolatrous offering imparts ritual impurity by means of a tent</b> to an individual or item situated together with it under the same structure, even if they do not come into direct contact? <b>As it is stated: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as a corpse imparts ritual impurity by means of a tent, so too idolatrous offerings impart ritual impurity by means of a tent. </b> Similarly, R' Yehuda ben Beteira would hold that just as it is prohibited to derive benefit from a corpse, so too it is prohibited to derive benefit from idolatrous offerings. |
| Psalms 106:28 | is stated: “And they joined themselves unto Ba’al-Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead” | Avodah Zarah48b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an idolatrous offering transmits impurity in a tent, </b> i.e., to that which is under the same roof? It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “And they joined themselves unto Ba’al-Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). It is derived from here that <b>just as a corpse transmits impurity in a tent, so too, an idolatrous offering transmits impurity in a tent. </b> |
| Psalms 106:28 | as it is stated: “They joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead” | Avodah Zarah50a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who withdraws</b> from those paths? <b>He holds in accordance with that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that with regard to an offering</b> brought in <b>idolatrous worship, </b> there can <b>never</b> be any <b>nullification</b> of its prohibited status? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “They joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as</b> the prohibited status of <b>a corpse has no nullification, </b> and it is <b>forever</b> prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>so too, </b> the prohibited status of <b>an offering</b> brought in <b>idolatrous worship has no nullification ever. </b> |
| Psalms 106:28 | as it is stated: “They adhered to Ba’al-Peor and ate the offerings to the dead” | Chullin 13b:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to an idolatrous offering that it imparts impurity in a tent? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “They adhered to Ba’al-Peor and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as a corpse imparts impurity in a tent, so too an idolatrous offering imparts impurity in a tent. </b> |
| Psalms 106:30 | as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed | Berakhot 26b:5 | The Talmud comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated</b> when Abraham came to look out over Sodom the day after he had prayed on its behalf: <b>“And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before YHWH” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> from the context as well as the language utilized in the verse, the verb <b>standing</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, </b> as this language is used to describe Pinehas’ prayer after the plague, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood up and prayed</b> and the plague ended” (Psalms 106:30). Clearly, Abraham was accustomed to stand in prayer in the morning. |
| Psalms 106:30 | “standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed” | Berakhot 6b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that Abraham our father set a fixed place</b> for his prayer? The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “And Abraham rose in the morning to the place where he had stood</b> before God” (Genesis 19:27), <b>and</b> the verb <b>“standing” means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Pinehas stood and prayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30). |
| Psalms 106:30 | “Then stood up Pinehas, and wrought judgment [ vayefallel ], | Chullin 134b:19 | <b>And</b> the <b>jaw</b> corresponds to the <b>prayer [<i>tefilla</i>]</b> offered by Pinehas during the aforementioned incident. <b>And so it states</b> in the verse: <b>“Then stood up Pinehas, and wrought judgment [<i>vayefallel</i>], </b> and so the plague was stayed. And that was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations forever” (Psalms 106:30). The <b>maw</b> is <b>as its plain meaning</b> in the verses describing the incident, <b>and it likewise states: </b> “And he thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, <b>and the woman through her belly. </b> So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel” (Numbers 25:8). |
| Psalms 106:30 | As it is written: “Then stood up Pinehas, and executed judgment [ vayefallel ], and the plague was stayed” | Sanhedrin 44a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Joshua is considered to have answered God with impudence? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “And he laid them out before YHWH, ” and Rav Naḥman says</b> that this means that Joshua <b>came and cast</b> the spoils <b>down before God</b> as part of his argument, this is difficult: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Pinehas did not act the same</b> way in the incident involving Zimri and Cozbi? <b>As it is written: “Then stood up Pinehas, and executed judgment [<i>vayefallel</i>], and the plague was stayed”</b> (Psalms 106:30), <b>and R' Elazar says: And he prayed [<i>vayitpallel</i>], is not stated; rather, “and he executed judgment [<i>vayefallel</i>]”</b> is stated, which <b>teaches that he entered into a judgment</b> together <b>with his Creator. </b> How so? <b>He came and cast</b> Zimri and Cozbi <b>down before God, </b> and <b>said to Him: God!, </b> was it <b>because of these</b> sinners that <b>twenty-four thousand</b> members <b>of the Jewish people fell? As it is written: “And those that died by the plague were twenty-four thousand”</b> (Numbers 25:9). |
| Psalms 106:30 | which is written: “And Pinehas stood and wrought judgment | Sanhedrin 82b:3 | Pinehas <b>came and slammed them</b> on the ground <b>before God</b> and <b>said before Him: God!, will twenty-four thousand</b> of the children <b>of Israel fall due to these</b> sinners? <b>As it is stated: “And those that died in the plague were twenty-four thousand”</b> (Numbers 25:9). <b>And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And Pinehas stood and wrought judgment</b> and the plague was stayed” (Psalms 106:30). |
| Psalms 107:4 | “They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell” | Berakhot 54b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>those who walk in the desert</b> are required to thank God? The Talmud answers: <br><b>As it is written</b> in the same psalm: <br><b>“They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell”</b> (Psalms 107:4),<br><b>“And then they cried unto YHWH</b> in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. <br><b>And He led them forth by the right way”</b> (Psalms 107:6–7). <b>After God guides them on the right way, it is said: <b>“They are grateful to God for His goodness”</b> (Psalms 107:8). |
| Psalms 107:8 | “They are grateful to God for His goodness” | Berakhot 54b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>those who walk in the desert</b> are required to thank God? The Talmud answers: <br><b>As it is written</b> in the same psalm: <br><b>“They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city in which to dwell”</b> (Psalms 107:4),<br><b>“And then they cried unto YHWH</b> in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. <br><b>And He led them forth by the right way”</b> (Psalms 107:6–7). <b>After God guides them on the right way, it is said: <b>“They are grateful to God for His goodness”</b> (Psalms 107:8). |

| Psalms 107:12 | And it says: “Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; | Berakhot 54b:16 | <b>From where</b> do we derive that <b>one who was incarcerated in prison</b> must offer thanks? <b><b>As it is written: “Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, </b> bound in affliction and iron. <br><b>Because they rebelled against the words of God</b> and scorned the counsel of the most High” (Psalms 107:10–11). <b><b>And it says: “Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; </b> they fell down, and there was none to help” (Psalms 107:12), <b><b>and it says: “Then they cried unto YHWH in their trouble, </b> and He saved them from their distresses” (Psalms 107:13), <b><b>and it says: “He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, </b> <b>and broke their shackles” (Psalms 107: 14). <br><b>And</b> after God takes them out from that darkness and shadow of death, <b>it says: “They are grateful to God for His goodness. ”</b> |

| Psalms 107:34 | “A fruitful land into a salt waste, from the wickedness of they who dwell there” | Ketubot 112a:3 | <b>In</b> the following <b>year, R' Elazar happened</b> to come <b>to that</b> same place, <b>and they brought</b> a peach <b>before him.

| Psalms 107:40 | say this: “He pours contempt upon princes, and causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way” | Pesachim 111a:13 | The Talmud cites a related statement: <b>One who meets a woman when she is ascending from the ritual immersion of a mitzva, </b> after her menstruation, <b>if he has sex</b> with any woman <b>first, a spirit of immorality overtakes him; if she has sex first, a spirit of immorality overtakes her.

| Psalms 108:5 | “For Your mercy is great above the heavens, | Pesachim 50b:5 | On the topic of reward for a mitzva fulfilled without intent, <b>Rava raised a contradiction: </b> It <b>is written: “For Your mercy is great unto the heavens, </b> and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 57:11); <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“For Your mercy is great above the heavens, </b> and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 108:5). <b>How so? </b> How can these verses be reconciled? The Talmud explains: <b>Here, </b> where the verse says that God’s mercy is above the heavens, it is referring to a case where <b>one performs</b> a mitzva <b>for its own sake; and here, </b> where the verse says that God’s mercy reaches the heavens, it is referring to a case where <b>one performs</b> a mitzva <b>not for its own sake. </b> Even a mitzva performed with ulterior motives garners reward, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always engage in Torah</b> study and performance of <b>mitzvot, even if</b> he does so <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, as through</b> the performance of mitzvot <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, </b> one gains understanding and <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for their</b> own <b>sake. </b> |
| Psalms 109:18 | from here: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones” | Niddah 32a:9 | Mar Zutra continues: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach that one who <b>drinks</b> <i>teruma</i> in a state of impurity is liable? Isn’t <b>drinking included</b> in the category of <b>eating? Rather, </b> the <i>baraita</i> means that the verse serves <b>to include one who smears, </b> teaching that he is <b>like one who drinks. And if you wish, say</b> that one may derive that smearing is like drinking <b>from here: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). |
| Psalms 109:18 | on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones” | Shabbat 86a:2 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The Mishnah continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the 3rd day</b> after sex <b>is ritually impure, </b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days, </b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day, </b> meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water. |
| Psalms 109:18 | Rav Zutra, son of Rabbi Toviya, said: The verse states: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones” | Yoma 76b:10 | <b>We have found</b> proof that abstaining from <b>smearing</b> oil on oneself is considered affliction; <b>from where do we</b> derive that abstaining from <b>bathing</b> is also called affliction? <b>Rav Zutra ben Toviya, said: The verse states: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). This means that the water with which one bathes and the oil with which one smears himself are absorbed into the body. Just as abstaining from smearing oil is considered an affliction, so too, abstaining from bathing is considered an affliction. The Talmud objects: <b>But say</b> that “came into his innards like water” is referring to <b>drinking</b> rather than smearing oil. The Talmud rejects this: <b>It is similar</b> to <b>oil. Just as</b> the <b>oil</b> described in the verse is smeared <b>from outside</b> the body and not drunk, <b>so too, </b> the <b>water</b> mentioned in the verse is used for bathing <b>from the outside. </b> It is not drunk. |
| Psalms 109:18 | as it is stated: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones” | Yoma 76b:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>But the <i>tanna</i> took</b> the <b>opposite</b> meaning, <b>as we learned</b> in a Mishnah: <b>From where do we derive that smearing</b> oil <b>is like drinking on Yom Kippur? Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof of the matter</b> from the Bible, <b>there is an allusion to the matter</b> from the verse, <b>as it is stated: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18), meaning that oil on the body is like water within it. Therefore, the phrase “and it came into his innards like water” is referring to the act of drinking water. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Bathing is derived from the same verse</b> cited above, <b>as it is written: “Neither did I anoint myself at all”</b> (Daniel 10:3). This teaches that Daniel did not do any anointing, including bathing. Consequently, the same source prohibits both of these activities. |
| Psalms 109:22 | as it is written: “And my heart is wounded within me” | Avodah Zarah4b:18 | <b>And this is</b> similar to that <b>which R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: David was not fit to</b> act as he did in <b>that incident</b> involving Bathsheba, <b>and the Jewish people were not fit to</b> act as they did in <b>that incident</b> of the Golden Calf. <b>David was not fit to</b> act as he did in <b>that incident</b> involving Bathsheba (see II Samuel, chapter 11), <b>as it is written: “And my heart is wounded within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22), i.e., he had vanquished his evil inclination, and therefore it should not have been able to rule over him to that extent. |
| Psalms 109:22 | as it is written: “And my heart has died within me” | Bava Batra17a:2 | There were <b>three</b> people <b>over whom the evil inclination had no sway. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written</b> with regard <b>to them, </b> respectively: <b>“With everything, ” “from everything, ” “everything. ”</b> The completeness of their blessings means that they did not have to contend with their evil inclinations. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even David</b> was not subject to his evil inclination, <b>as it is written: “And my heart has died within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22), meaning that the evil inclination in his heart was nullified as if his heart had died. <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> authority, who does not include David in his list, explain this verse? <b>He is mentioning his travails. </b> David means to say that his heart died within him owing to all the suffering that he endured, but he says nothing about his evil inclination. |
| Psalms 109:22 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart. The <b>evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes”</b> (Psalms 36:2). <b>Middling people are ruled by both</b> the good and evil inclinations, <b>as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul”</b> (Psalms 109:31). |
| Psalms 109:31 | as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul” | Berakhot 61b:2 | With regard to one’s inclinations, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart.

| Psalms 112:1 | “Happy is the man that fears the Lord, | Avodah Zarah19a:3 | The Talmud cites an interpretation of a similar verse: <b>“Happy is the man that fears YHWH, </b> that delights greatly in His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1). The Talmud asks: Is that to say <b>happy is the man, but not happy is the woman? </b> Why is it necessary for the verse to emphasize that it is speaking of a man? <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> The verse applies to both men and women and is teaching: <b>Happy is one who repents when he is</b> still <b>a man, </b> i.e., before he becomes elderly and his strength dwindles. <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: Happy is one who triumphs over his</b> evil <b>inclination like a man, </b> i.e., with strength and vigor. |
| Psalms 112:1 | it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord, | Berakhot 8a:21 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears YHWH, </b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Talmud explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him. </b> |
| Psalms 112:3 | “Wealth and riches are in his house, and his charity endures forever” | Ketubot 50a:13 | The rabbis likewise expounded the verse: <b>“Wealth and riches are in his house, and his charity endures forever”</b> (Psalms 112:3). How can one’s wealth and riches remain in his house while his charity endures forever? <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> disputed this issue. <b>One said: This</b> is referring to <b>one who studies Torah and teaches it. </b> He loses nothing of his own, while his charity toward others will endure. <b>And one said: This is one who writes</b> scrolls of <b>the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings, and lends them to others. </b> The books remain in his possession, but others gain from his charity. |
| Psalms 112:5 | which is written: “Good is the man who is gracious and lends, who orders his affairs with justice” | Chullin 84b:4 | <b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> the following verse homiletically, but <b>sometimes</b> he <b>said</b> the interpretation <b>in the name of R' Ami and sometimes he said it in the name of R' Asi: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Good is the man who is gracious and lends, who orders his affairs with justice”</b> (Psalms 112:5)? It means to teach that <b>a person should always eat and drink less than what is</b> within <b>his means, and he should dress and cover himself in accordance with his means, and he should honor his wife and children more than what is</b> within <b>his means; as they are dependent on him and he is dependent on the One Who spoke and the world was</b> created. |
| Psalms 112:7 | from my house. And of him, the verse says: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord” | Berakhot 60a:16 | <b>A baraita states: There was an incident involving Hillel the Elder, who was coming on the road when he heard a scream in the city. He said: I am certain that</b> the scream <b>is not</b> coming <b>from my house. And of him, the verse says: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in YHWH”</b> (Psalms 112:7). <b>Rava said: Any way that you interpret this verse, </b> its meaning is clear. <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end</b> or <b>it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end: Why is it that: He shall not be afraid of evil tidings? </b> Because <b>his heart is steadfast, trusting in YHWH. </b> The Talmud continues: <b>And it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning: </b> One whose <b>heart is steadfast, trusting in YHWH</b> is a person who <b>shall not be afraid of evil tidings. </b> |
| Psalms 112:9 | said to them: Go out and see what my father David explained: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn shall be exalted with honor” | Bava Batra10b:4 | <b>And R' Abbahu says: They asked</b> King <b>Solomon, son of David: How far does the power of charity extend? </b> King Solomon <b>said to them: Go out and see what my father David explained: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn shall be exalted with honor”</b> (Psalms 112:9). <b>R' Abba said: </b> It is derived <b>from here</b> how far the power of charity extends: <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks; his bread shall be given, his water shall be sure”</b> (Isaiah 33:16). <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks”? Because “his bread shall be given”</b> to the poor, <b>and “his water shall be sure, ”</b> i.e., it shall be given faithfully and he can be trusted in the matter. |
| Psalms 112:10 | “The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish” | Pesachim 117a:22 | <b>Rav Ḥanin bar Rava said: Everyone concedes</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“My mouth shall speak the praise of YHWH; and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever”</b> (Psalms 145:21), that the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows, </b> the opening word of the subsequent psalm, marks <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter, </b> not the conclusion of the previous one. Likewise, with regard to the verse: <b>“The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish”</b> (Psalms 112:10), the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows it, </b> is <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter.

| Psalms 113:1 | “Give praise, O servants of the Lord” | Arakhin 10b:8 | <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> an alternative answer as to why <i>hallel</i> is not recited on Purim: <b>The reading of</b> the Megilla, i.e., the Scroll of Esther, <b>is</b> equivalent to reciting <b><i>hallel</i>. Rava says</b> a 3rd reason: <b>Granted, </b> <i>hallel</i> is said <b>there, </b> when recalling the exodus from Egypt, as after that salvation one can recite the phrase in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Give praise, O servants of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 113:1), since after the Israelites’ servitude to Pharaoh ended with their salvation, they were truly servants of YHWH <b>and not servants of Pharaoh. </b> But can it be said <b>here, </b> after the salvation commemorated on Purim: <b>“Give praise, O servants of YHWH, ”</b> which would indicate that after the salvation the Jewish people were only servants of YHWH <b>and not servants of Ahasuerus? </b> Not so, as even after the miracle of Purim, <b>we are still the servants of Ahasuerus, </b> since the Jews remained in exile under Persian rule. |
| Psalms 113:1 | “Give praise, O servants of the Lord” | Megillah 14a:8 | <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> an alternative answer as to why <i>hallel</i> is not recited on Purim: <b>The reading of</b> the Megilla itself <b>is</b> an act of reciting <b><i>hallel</i>.

| Psalms 113:1 | recites: “ Halleluya ” | Sukkah 38b:1 | <b>Many significant <i>halakhot</i> can be learned from the custom of <i>hallel</i></b> based on the manner in which it was recited. In reciting <i>hallel</i> there are allusions to several halakhic matters and customs that the rabbis instituted due to circumstances extant at the time. Although due to increased literacy and familiarity with the <i>hallel</i> liturgy the reasons no longer apply, these customs remain in practice. The prayer leader <b>recites: “<i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 113:1), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: <i>Halleluya</i>, </b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source <b>that</b> there is <b>a mitzva to respond: <i>Halleluya</i>. </b> |
| Psalms 113:1 | recites: “Give praise, servants of the Lord” | Sukkah 38b:2 | Likewise, the prayer leader <b>recites: “Give praise, servants of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 113:1), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: <i>Halleluya</i>, </b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> cited in the Mishnah <b>that if an adult male was reciting</b> <i>hallel</i> <b>on his</b> behalf, <b>he answers: <i>Halleluya</i>. He recites: “Thank YHWH, </b> for He is good” (Psalms 118:1), <b>and they respond: “Thank YHWH, </b> for He is good. ” <b>From here</b> is the source <b>that</b> there is <b>a mitzva to respond</b> by reciting <b>the beginnings of chapters.

| Psalms 113:2 | “Blessed be the name of the Lord” | Megillah 17a:16 | <b>Rav Avya said: </b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Blessed be the name of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 113:2), indicating that the blessing of God must “be” just as it is written. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> who said: It is derived from <b>here, </b> the end of the aforementioned verse: <b>“From now and for evermore”</b> (Psalms 113:2), i.e., it should be like time, which cannot be reversed. |
| Psalms 113:3 | “From the rising of the sun until its setting | Megillah 17a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>hallel</i></b> may not be recited out of order? <b>Rabba said: As it is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun until its setting</b> YHWH’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). Just as the sunrise and sunset cannot be reversed, so too, <i>hallel</i> may not be recited out of order. <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i> that states: <b>“This is the day that YHWH has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24); just as the day follows a certain order, so too, <i>hallel</i> must be recited in its proper order. |
| Psalms 113:3 | “From the rising of the sun to its setting, | Megillah 20b:11 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that these mitzvot were commanded to be performed specifically during the day? With regard to reading the Megilla, <b>the verse states: “That these days should be remembered and kept”</b> (Esther 9:28). <b>For reciting the <i>hallel</i>, </b> the proof is from <b>that which is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun to its setting, </b> YHWH’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). <b>R' Yosei said: </b> The proof is from another verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“This is the day that YHWH has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24), implying that it is to be recited during the day and not at night. |
| Psalms 113:7 | about himself: “Who lifts up the needy out of the trash heap” | Yoma 87a:14 | The Talmud relates that <b>R' Yirmeya</b> insulted <b>R' Abba, </b> causing the latter to <b>have a complaint against him. </b> R' Yirmeya <b>went and sat at the threshold</b> of <b>R' Abba’s</b> house to beg him for forgiveness. <b>When</b> R' Abba’s <b>maid poured out the</b> dirty <b>water</b> from the house, <b>the stream of water landed on</b> R' Yirmeya’s <b>head.

| Psalms 113:9 | saying: “A joyful mother of children” | Bava Batra120a:3 | The verse concerning Amram’s marriage to Jochebed states: “And a man of the house of Levi went, <b>and took</b> as a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Talmud asks: Since Jochebed had already been married to Amram for some years, as Miriam and Aaron were already born, the verse <b>should have</b> stated: <b>And</b> he <b>took back</b> as a wife. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says: </b> The wording of the verse <b>teaches that</b> Amram <b>performed for her</b> a formal <b>act of marriage</b> as though he were marrying her for the first time. He <b>seated her in</b> a bridal <b>palanquin [<i>be’appiryon</i>], and Aaron and Miriam</b> were <b>singing before her, and</b> the <b>ministering angels</b> were <b>saying: “A joyful mother of children”</b> (Psalms 113:9). |

| Psalms 115:1 | And Beit Hillel say: Until “Not to us, God, not to us” | Pesachim 117a:24 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us say</b> it is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>, </b> as we learned in the Mishnah: <b>Until where does one recite</b> <i>hallel</i>? <b>Beit Shammai say: Until “A joyful mother of children, </b> <i>halleluya</i>” (Psalms 113:9). <b>And Beit Hillel say: Until “The flint into a fountain of waters”</b> (Psalms 114:8). <b>And it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> source, a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until where does one recite</b> <i>hallel</i>? <b>Beit Shammai say: Until “When Israel came forth out of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 114:1), the beginning of the first passage after “A joyful mother of children, <i>halleluya</i>. ” <b>And Beit Hillel say: Until “Not to us, God, not to us”</b> (Psalms 115:1), which follows “the flint into a fountain of waters. ” |

| Psalms 115:8 | reciting hallel | Pesachim 117a:10 | <b>Alternatively, </b> is it possible that <b>Micah’s idol stood in tears, and the Jewish people</b> were <b>reciting <i>hallel</i></b> before it? The reference is to the idol of Micah, which was still standing in the days of David (see Judges 17). The Talmud states that the idol was crying, as a euphemism for its laughter, to avoid shaming the Jewish people (<i>ge’onim</i>). The point is that the Jews would not have chanted: “They who make them shall be like them” (Psalms 115:8) at a time that they were worshipping idols. Rather, <i>hallel</i> must be older than that, and it dates back to the Song at the Sea. |
| Psalms 115:16 | “The heavens are the Lord’s and the earth He has given over to mankind” | Berakhot 35a:21 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is YHWH’s, </b> the world and all those who live in it” (Psalms 24:1). R' Levi expressed this concept differently. <b>R' Levi raised a contradiction: It is written: “The earth and all it contains is YHWH’s, ” and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The heavens are YHWH’s and the earth He has given over to mankind”</b> (Psalms 115:16). There is clearly a contradiction with regard to whom the earth belongs. He himself resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult.

| Psalms 115:16 | as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth has He given to the children of men” | Gittin 47a:8 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rabba says: Even though a non-Jew has no</b> capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated: “For the land is Mine”</b> (Leviticus 25:23), which teaches: <b>The sanctity of the land is Mine, </b> and it is not abrogated when the land is sold to a non-Jew; <b>a non-Jew does have, however, </b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves</b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of YHWH; but the earth has He given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16). |

Apparently, from ten handbreadths upward is considered a separate domain. Consequently, any <i>sukka</i> that is not at least ten handbreadths high is not considered an independent domain and is unfit. |
| Psalms 115:16 | land is not a man, as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth He has given to the children of men” | Yevamot 63a:2 | § The Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for a series of statements cited in the name of R' Elazar: <b>Woman; and land; helper; this; two; the blessings; merchants; lowly. </b> The Talmud presents these statements: <b>R' Elazar said: Any man who does not have a wife is not a man, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them…and called their name Adam”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>And R' Elazar said: Any man who does not have</b> his own <b>land is not a man, as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of YHWH; but the earth He has given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16). |
| Psalms 115:17 | contradict each other. Your father David said: “The dead praise not the Lord, | Shabbat 30a:3 | The Talmud relates: <b>This question was asked before R' Tanḥum from</b> the village of <b>Nevi: What is</b> the ruling <b>with regard to extinguishing a burning lamp before a sick person on Shabbat? </b> The Talmud relates that R' Tanḥum delivered an entire homily touching upon both aggadic and halakhic materials surrounding this question. <b>He began and said: You, </b> King <b>Solomon, where is your wisdom, where is your understanding?

These are different assessments of life and death. |
| Psalms 116:1 | which is written: “I love that the Lord should hear | Pesachim 118b:9 | <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I love that YHWH should hear</b> my voice and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1)? <b>The Congregation of Israel said: God!, when am I beloved by You, </b> and I know that I am loved? <b>When You hear the voice of my supplications. “I was brought low, and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). <b>The Congregation of Israel said before God: God!, although I am lowly in mitzvot, </b> as I do not always fulfill them properly, <b>I am Yours, </b> and therefore <b>it is fitting</b> that <b>I</b> should <b>be saved. </b> |
| Psalms 116:1 | “I love that the Lord hears | Pesachim 64a:14 | <b>The first group exited</b> upon completion of the rite, <b>and the second group entered; the second group left</b> upon completion of its rite, <b>and the 3rd group entered.

| Psalms 116:1 | in favor of kindness. And about them, David said: “I love the Lord, Who hears | Rosh Hashanah17a:8 | The Talmud asks: Can the verse be referring to <b>the rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies?

When</b> in addition to their having sinned with their bodies, the <b>majority</b> of their actions are <b>sins. </b> But <b>here, </b> the verse is referring to people for whom <b>half</b> of their actions are <b>sins and half</b> are <b>meritorious deeds, and</b> those sins <b>include the sin of the rebellious Jews</b> who sin <b>with their bodies. It is not sufficient that they not be</b> subject to the verse: <b>“And I will bring the 3rd part through the fire. ” However, if</b> their sins and meritorious deeds are equally balanced, and they did <b>not</b> sin with their bodies, He Who is <b>“abundant in kindness” tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness.

| Psalms 116:1 | to recite: “I love that the Lord hears | Sukkah 54b:1 | The Talmud rejects this answer. <b>If</b> it is <b>due to</b> the case of <b>Passover eve, that is not an omission, </b> as <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> of <b>this</b> Mishnah? <b>It is R' Yehuda, who said: </b> Although there were three shifts in the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb, <b>never in the all the days of the 3rd shift did it reach</b> the point in <i>hallel</i> <b>to recite: “I love that YHWH hears</b> my voice” (Psalms 116:1), which is the second paragraph of <i>hallel</i>, <b>because</b> the <b>people</b> participating in the 3rd shift <b>were few. </b> Therefore, when they reached that section of <i>hallel</i> they had already completed the slaughter of all the offerings, and consequently only one set of blasts was sounded during this shift, for a total of forty-two. |

Apparently, a minor is unable to conceive. |
| Psalms 116:6 | “The Lord preserves the simple” | Niddah 31a:8 | The rabbis <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who has sex</b> with his wife <b>on the ninetieth day</b> of her pregnancy, <b>it is as though he spills</b> her <b>blood. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>How does one know</b> that it is the ninetieth day of her pregnancy? <b>Rather, Abaye says: One should go ahead and have sex</b> with his wife even if it might be the ninetieth day, <b>and</b> rely on God to prevent any ensuing harm, as the verse states: <b>“YHWH preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6). |
| Psalms 116:6 | as it is stated: “The Lord preserves the simple” | Niddah 45a:14 | <b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case of a minor girl who can become pregnant <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case of a minor girl who cannot become pregnant, she <b>may go ahead and have sex in her usual manner, and Heaven will have mercy</b> upon her and prevent any mishap, <b>as it is stated: “YHWH preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6).

| Psalms 116:6 | When You hear the voice of my supplications. “I was brought low, and He saved me” | Pesachim 118b:9 | <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I love that YHWH should hear</b> my voice and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1)? <b>The Congregation of Israel said: God!, when am I beloved by You, </b> and I know that I am loved? <b>When You hear the voice of my supplications. “I was brought low, and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). <b>The Congregation of Israel said before God: God!, although I am lowly in mitzvot, </b> as I do not always fulfill them properly, <b>I am Yours, </b> and therefore <b>it is fitting</b> that <b>I</b> should <b>be saved. </b> |

And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“Hew down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth”</b> (Daniel 4:20). If that is the case with regard to Nebuchadnezzar, all the more so it is the case with regard to the wicked people of Israel. <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“So that it will leave them neither root nor branch”? </b> It means that God <b>will not leave for</b> the wicked <b>a mitzva nor the remnants of a mitzva</b> for which they will be rewarded. R' Akiva dug deep to find a way into the World-to-Come for these children. <b>Alternatively, “root”; this</b> is referring to the <b>soul. “Nor branch”; this</b> is referring to <b>the body. </b> |
| Psalms 116:6 | “The Lord protects the simple-hearted” | Shabbat 129b:5 | The Talmud explains: <b>On the 3rd day of the week, what is the reason</b> that one does <b>not</b> let blood? It is <b>because</b> the planet <b>Mars is dominant during the even</b> hours. Since it is a planet of blood, and the even hours are a bad omen, that combination gives cause for concern. The Talmud asks: On <b>Shabbat eve, </b> Mars <b>also dominates during the even</b> hours. The Talmud answers: <b>Since</b> the <b>multitudes have</b> already become <b>accustomed to</b> letting blood on Shabbat eve, the verse: <b>“YHWH protects the simple-hearted”</b> (Psalms 116:6) applies in this case. |
| Psalms 116:6 | as it is stated: “The Lord preserves the simple” | Yevamot 100b:18 | <b>And the Rabbis say: </b> Both <b>this one and that one, </b> i.e., women in any cases, <b>should go ahead and have sex in their usual manner, and Heaven will have mercy</b> and prevent them from getting pregnant, <b>as it is stated: “YHWH preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6). Evidently, a girl who is a minor and therefore young enough to refuse her husband cannot become pregnant without endangering her health. |
| Psalms 116:6 | “The Lord preserves the simple” | Yevamot 72a:3 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Therefore, </b> learn from here that on <b>a cloudy day or</b> on <b>a day</b> that <b>a south wind [<i>shuta</i>]</b> blows, <b>we may neither circumcise nor let</b> blood <b>[<i>mesokhrinan</i>], </b> owing to the danger involved. <b>But nowadays, when many are accustomed to</b> ignoring these safeguards, the verse <b>“YHWH preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6) is applied, and it is assumed that they will come to no harm. |
| Psalms 116:9 | The resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “I will walk before the Lord | Pesachim 118a:15 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>The exodus from Egypt, as it is written: “When Israel came forth out of Egypt, </b> the house of Jacob from a people of strange language” (Psalms 114:1). <b>And the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “The sea saw it and fled; </b> the Jordan turned backward” (Psalms 114:3). <b>The giving of the Torah, as it is written: “The mountains skipped like rams”</b> (Psalms 114:4), which is similar to the description of the giving of the Torah found elsewhere in the books of the Prophets. <b>The resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “I will walk before YHWH</b> in the lands of the living” (Psalms 116:9), which follows the verse: “For you have delivered my soul from death. ” After mentioning death, the psalm describes the resurrection in the lands of the living. |
| Psalms 116:9 | “I shall walk before the Lord in the lands of the living” | Yoma 71a:16 | Further apropos the phrase: The One Who grants life to the living, the Talmud explains a verse using a similar phrase and then additional verses. With regard to the verse: <b>“I shall walk before YHWH in the lands of the living”</b> (Psalms 116:9), <b>Rav Yehuda said: This is the place of markets, </b> where food and needs can be readily obtained.

| Psalms 116:16 | which is written: “You have loosened my bands” | Yevamot 77a:5 | With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You have loosened my bands”</b> (Psalms 116:16)? <b>David said before God: God!, You have loosened the two bands that were on me, </b> on account of which I and my entire family might have been disqualified, i.e., <b>Ruth the Moabite woman and Na’ama the Ammonite woman. </b> Owing to the allowance granted to Moabite and Ammonite women, we are permitted to enter the congregation. |

| Psalms 118:1 | he answers: Halleluya . He recites: “Thank the Lord, | Sukkah 38b:2 | Likewise, the prayer leader <b>recites: “Give praise, servants of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 113:1), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: <i>Halleluya</i>, </b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> cited in the Mishnah <b>that if an adult male was reciting</b> <i>hallel</i> <b>on his</b> behalf, <b>he answers: <i>Halleluya</i>.

| Psalms 118:5 | kesya and merḥavya | Pesachim 117a:1 | The Mishnah states that we will say before Him: <i>Halleluya</i>. The Talmud discusses the meaning of this term. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> The word <b><i>halleluya</i></b> and the word <b><i>kesya</i></b> (Exodus 17:16) and the name <b>Yedidya</b> (II Samuel 12:25) <b>are</b> each regarded as <b>a single</b> word, not an amalgamation of two smaller words, i.e., <i>Hallelu</i>-<i>ya</i>. <b>Rav said</b> that <b><i>kesya</i> and <i>merḥavya</i></b> (Psalms 118:5) <b>are single</b> words. <b>Rabba said: Only <i>merḥavya</i></b> is a single word; the others are two words. |
| Psalms 118:20 | said to him: “This is the gate of the Lord; | Tamid 32b:3 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say: He took from those waters</b> and <b>washed his face. </b> And <b>there are</b> those <b>who say: He ascended</b> along the length of <b>the entire</b> spring <b>until he reached the entrance of the Garden of Eden.

Since you are not righteous, you may not enter. <b>He said to them: I too</b> am worthy, as <b>I am a king; I am very important. </b> If I will not be admitted, at least <b>give me something</b> from inside. <b>They gave him one eyeball.

| Psalms 118:24 | “This is the day that the Lord has made” | Megillah 17a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>hallel</i></b> may not be recited out of order? <b>Rabba said: As it is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun until its setting</b> YHWH’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). Just as the sunrise and sunset cannot be reversed, so too, <i>hallel</i> may not be recited out of order. <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i> that states: <b>“This is the day that YHWH has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24); just as the day follows a certain order, so too, <i>hallel</i> must be recited in its proper order. |
| Psalms 118:24 | “This is the day that the Lord has made” | Megillah 20b:11 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that these mitzvot were commanded to be performed specifically during the day? With regard to reading the Megilla, <b>the verse states: “That these days should be remembered and kept”</b> (Esther 9:28). <b>For reciting the <i>hallel</i>, </b> the proof is from <b>that which is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun to its setting, </b> YHWH’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). <b>R' Yosei said: </b> The proof is from another verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“This is the day that YHWH has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24), implying that it is to be recited during the day and not at night. |

| Psalms 118:25 | “Lord, please save us” | Sukkah 37b:7 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>And where</b> in the recitation of <i>hallel</i> <b>would they wave</b> the <i>lulav</i>? They would do so <b>at</b> the verse: <b>“Thank YHWH, </b> for He is good” (Psalms 118:1, 29) that appears <b>at</b> both <b>the beginning and the end</b> of the psalm, <b>and at</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, please save us”</b> (Psalms 118:25); this is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.

| Psalms 118:25 | recites: “Lord, please save us” | Sukkah 38b:3 | Rava continued to cite the significant <i>halakhot</i> learned from <i>hallel</i>. The prayer leader <b>recites: “Lord, please save us”</b> (Psalms 118:25), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: “Lord, please save us, ”</b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> cited in the Mishnah <b>that if a minor was reciting</b> a portion that is not from the beginning of a chapter <b>on one’s</b> behalf, <b>he recites after him</b> precisely <b>what he says. </b> |
| Psalms 118:25 | Lord, please grant us success” | Sukkah 38b:4 | The prayer leader <b>recites: “Lord, please grant us success, ” and</b> the congregation <b>recites</b> in response: “<b>Lord, please grant us success”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> one <b>comes to repeat</b> a particular verse in <i>hallel</i> twice, <b>he</b> may <b>repeat</b> it.

| Psalms 118:25 | circle the altar one time and say: “Lord, please save us.

| Psalms 118:27 | They all recited: “The Lord is God, and has given us light” | Pesachim 119a:14 | <b>The brothers of</b> David <b>recited: “We beseech You, Lord, save now”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>David recited: “We beseech You, Lord, make us prosper now”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>Yishai recited: “Blessed be he who comes in the name of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 118:26). <b>Samuel recited: “We bless you out of the house of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 118:26). <b>They all recited: “YHWH is God, and has given us light”</b> (Psalms 118:27). <b>Samuel recited: “Order the Festival procession with boughs, </b> even to the horns of the altar” (Psalms 118:27). <b>David recited: “You are my God, and I will give thanks to You”</b> (Psalms 118:28). <b>They all recited: “You are my God, I will exalt You”</b> (Psalms 118:28). |
| Psalms 118:27 | as it is stated: “Encircle [ isru ] with branches on the Festival until the horns of the altar” | Sukkah 45a:7 | <b>R' Abbahu said: What is</b> the <b>verse</b> that alludes to the fact that the branches must lean one cubit over the top of the altar? It is <b>as it is stated: “Encircle [<i>isru</i>] with branches on the Festival until the horns of the altar”</b> (Psalms 118:27), indicating that willow branches should surround the horns of the altar. That is facilitated by standing the branches on the base. The Talmud cites derivations based on different interpretations of the terms in that verse. <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Elazar said: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who takes a <i>lulav</i> in its binding and a myrtle branch in its dense-leaved</b> form, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he built an altar and sacrificed an offering upon it, as it is stated: </b> |

| Psalms 118:28 | David recited: “You are my God, and I will give thanks to You” | Pesachim 119a:14 | <b>The brothers of</b> David <b>recited: “We beseech You, Lord, save now”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>David recited: “We beseech You, Lord, make us prosper now”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>Yishai recited: “Blessed be he who comes in the name of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 118:26). <b>Samuel recited: “We bless you out of the house of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 118:26). <b>They all recited: “YHWH is God, and has given us light”</b> (Psalms 118:27). <b>Samuel recited: “Order the Festival procession with boughs, </b> even to the horns of the altar” (Psalms 118:27). <b>David recited: “You are my God, and I will give thanks to You”</b> (Psalms 118:28). <b>They all recited: “You are my God, I will exalt You”</b> (Psalms 118:28). |
| Psalms 119:11 | is called a sinner, as it is stated: “Your word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You” | Eruvin 63a:21 | <b>Ze’eiri</b> said that <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence <b>is called a sinner, as it is stated: “Your word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You”</b> (Psalms 119:11). In what case would speaking one’s word entail a sin? In a case where one rules on a matter of <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher. |
| Psalms 119:20 | “My soul breaks [ garesa ] for the longing that it has | Avodah Zarah19a:10 | <b>And Rava says</b> with regard to Torah study: <b>A person should always study [<i>ligeris</i>]</b> and review <b>even though</b> he may afterward <b>forget, and even though he does not understand what it is saying. As it is stated</b> with regard to the study of Torah: <b>“My soul breaks [<i>garesa</i>] for the longing that it has</b> for Your ordinances at all times” (Psalms 119:20). <b>It is written: “Breaks, ” and it is not written: Grinds, </b> demonstrating that the soul is satisfied with breaking apart material, on a basic level, even if it does not have the opportunity to grind and analyze it in greater depth. |
| Psalms 119:28 | be inferred that nugei is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [ tuga ]” | Berakhot 28a:19 | Similarly, <b>R' Elazar said: Regarding anyone who recites the morning prayer after four hours</b> of the day, <b>according to R' Yehuda, the verse states: “Those who are in sorrow [<i>nugei</i>] far from the Festivals, I shall gather from you, </b> they who carried for you the burden of insult” (Zephaniah 3:18). <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that <i>nugei</i> is an expression of sorrow? As it is written: “My soul drips in sorrow [<i>tuga</i>]”</b> (Psalms 119:28). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> The proof that <i>nugei</i> indicates suffering is <b>from here: “Her virgins are sorrowed [<i>nugot</i>] and she is embittered”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). |
| Psalms 119:46 | “And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed” | Berakhot 4a:10 | <b>Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed”</b> (Psalms 119:46). This verse alludes both to David’s commitment to Torah, in contrast to the kings of the East and the West, as well as to the fact that he was not ashamed to discuss matters of Torah with Mefivoshet, a descendant of kings. David was not afraid to have his mistakes corrected by Mefivoshet. |
| Psalms 119:54 | because he called matters of Torah: Songs, as it is stated: “Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage” | Sotah 35a:21 | <b>Rava taught: For what</b> reason <b>was David punished</b> with Uzzah’s death? He was punished <b>because he called matters of Torah: Songs, as it is stated: “Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage”</b> (Psalms 119:54). |
| Psalms 119:56 | “This I have had, as I have kept Your precepts” | Avodah Zarah44a:16 | The Talmud asks with regard to the verse: <b>“This I have had, as I have kept Your precepts”</b> (Psalms 119:56): <b>What is it saying? </b> The Talmud answers that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: As reward for</b> the fact <b>that I kept your precepts, this</b> crown <b>was a testimony for me</b> that I am fit to be king. <b>What</b> exactly <b>was its testimony? R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: </b> It was <b>that</b> David <b>would place</b> the crown on his head <b>on the spot</b> where one dons <b>tefillin, and it fit him</b> perfectly. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> how could he have worn the crown? <b>Wasn’t he required to don tefillin? R' Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: There is</b> enough <b>space on</b> the part of <b>the head that is fit for donning</b> tefillin for one to don <b>two tefillin. </b> |
| Psalms 119:62 | One verse says: “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws” | Berakhot 3b:14 | <b>What is R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>reasoning? R' Zerika said</b> that <b>R' Ami said</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion is based on a comparison of two verses. <b>One verse says: “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws”</b> (Psalms 119:62), <b>and the other verse says: “My eyes forestall the watches, </b> that I will speak of Your word” (Psalms 119:148). Taken together, these verses indicate that their author, King David, rose at midnight, two watches before dawn, in order to study Torah. <b>How is it</b> possible to reconcile these two verses? Only if <b>there are four watches in the night</b> does one who rises two watches before dawn rise at midnight. |
| Psalms 119:62 | “At midnight I rise to give thanks” | Berakhot 4a:8 | The Talmud further explores King David’s character. It is said: “A prayer <b>of David…Keep my soul, for I am pious”</b> (Psalms 86:1–2). Levi and R' Yitzḥak debated the meaning of this verse and how David’s piety is manifest in the fact that he went beyond his fundamental obligations. <b>One said: </b> David’s declaration of piety referred to his awakening during the night to pray, and <b>so said David before God: God!, am I not pious? As all of the kings of the East and the West sleep until the 3rd hour</b> of the day, <b>but</b> although I am a king like them, <b>“At midnight I rise to give thanks”</b> (Psalms 119:62). |
| Psalms 119:74 | With regard to David, who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who fear You will see me and be glad” | Eruvin 53a:24 | The Talmud relates that King <b>David would disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in advance, whereas <b>Saul would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied. <b>With regard to David, who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who fear You will see me and be glad”</b> (Psalms 119:74), since all were prepared and could enjoy his Torah. <b>With regard to Saul, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied, <b>it is written: “And wherever he turned himself</b> |
| Psalms 119:79 | from him, as it is stated: “Let those who fear You turn to me, | Sanhedrin 107a:18 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> For <b>six months David was afflicted with tzara'at and the Shekhina abandoned him and</b> the members of <b>the Sanhedrin dissociated</b> themselves <b>from him. He was afflicted with tzara'at, as it is stated: “Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow”</b> (Psalms 51:9), indicating that he required purification like a metzora. <b>The Shekhina abandoned him, as it is stated: “Restore me to joy of Your salvation; and uphold me with a willing spirit”</b> (Psalms 51:14). <b>And</b> the members of <b>the Sanhedrin dissociated</b> themselves <b>from him, as it is stated: “Let those who fear You turn to me, </b> and those who have known Your testimonies” (Psalms 119:79). <b>From where do we</b> derive that this lasted for <b>six months? </b> It is derived <b>as it is written: “And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; </b> |
| Psalms 119:79 | “May those who fear You return to me, and they who know Your testimonies” | Yoma 22b:14 | The Talmud challenges this: <b>There, too, </b> in the incident with Bathsheba, David <b>was not punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body; </b> rather, it was his children who suffered punishment. The Talmud answers: That is <b>not so; he was punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body, </b> for that sin, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: David was stricken with tzara'at</b> for <b>six months</b> after that incident, <b>and the Sanhedrin withdrew from him</b> in protest over his behavior, <b>and the Shekhina</b> also <b>left him. As it is written</b> that David prayed: <b>“May those who fear You return to me, and they who know Your testimonies”</b> (Psalms 119:79). Since he prayed for the return of those who fear God and who know His testimonies, referring to the rabbis of the Sanhedrin, it can be inferred that they had withdrawn from him. <b>And it is written</b> as well: <b>“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, </b> let a vigorous spirit support me” (Psalms 51:14), where David asks for the return of the Holy Spirit, which had left him. |
| Psalms 119:91 | from this verse: “They stand this day according to Your judgments; for all are Your servants” | Nedarim 41a:7 | <b>And R' Alexandri said</b> that <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said, and some say R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: Once the end</b> of the time allotted for the life of <b>a person arrived, everything has dominion over him, as it is stated</b> that Cain said: <b>“Whosoever finds me will slay me”</b> (Genesis 4:14). Cain feared that since God sentenced him to death he would be susceptible to all threats and vulnerable to anyone seeking to murder him. <b>Rav said</b> that it is derived <b>from this verse: “They stand this day according to Your judgments; for all are Your servants”</b> (Psalms 119:91). When the decree emerges from Heaven that the time has arrived for a person to die, everyone is a servant of God, an agent to kill him. |
| Psalms 119:96 | which is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad” | Eruvin 21a:13 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad”</b> (Psalms 119:96)? <b>This</b> idea with regard to the breadth of the Torah <b>was stated by David, but he did not explain it; </b> it was <b>stated by Job, but he</b> too <b>did not explain it; </b> it was <b>stated by Ezekiel, but he</b> also <b>did not explain it, until Zechariah, </b> son of Berechiah, <b>son of Iddo, came and explained it. </b> |
| Psalms 119:97 | “O how I love Your Torah; it is my meditation all the day” | Menachot 18a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: Upon hearing this, <b>R' Elazar ben Shammua’s eyes streamed with tears, </b> and <b>he said: Happy are you, Torah scholars, for whom matters of Torah are exceedingly dear. </b> R' Elazar ben Shammua <b>recited this verse about</b> Yosef the Babylonian: <b>“O how I love Your Torah; it is my meditation all the day”</b> (Psalms 119:97). He continued: <b>Because R' Yehuda</b> is <b>the son of R' Elai, and R' Elai</b> is <b>the student of R' Eliezer, therefore</b> R' Yehuda <b>taught you the Mishnah of R' Eliezer</b> that the offering is unfit. |
| Psalms 119:106 | As it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe Your righteous ordinances” | Chagigah 10a:12 | Finally, <b>if</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the statement <b>of R' Ḥananya ben Yehoshua’s brother, perhaps</b> the phrase “and fulfilled it” should be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Giddel, </b> who said that <b>Rav said</b> a different interpretation of this verse. <b>As Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> although one is already obligated to fulfill all mitzvot <b>one may take an oath to fulfill a mitzva, </b> and this is not considered an oath taken in vain? <b>As it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). |
| Psalms 119:106 | says: They have something to support them, as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe your righteous ordinances” | Chagigah 10a:8 | <b>R' Yitzḥak says: </b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “Whoever is of a willing heart, </b> let him bring it” (Exodus 35:5). This verse indicates that as long as one retains the same desire to fulfill the vow, he must continue to fulfill it, but if he regrets taking the vow he may arrange for it to be dissolved. <b>Ḥananya ben Yehoshua’s brother, </b> also <b>says: They have something to support them, as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). This verse indicates that certain oaths need not be fulfilled, i.e., those that have been dissolved. |
| Psalms 119:106 | as it is stated: “I have sworn and I have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances” | Nedarim 8a:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may take an oath to fulfill a mitzva? </b> It is <b>as it is stated: “I have sworn and I have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). |
| Psalms 119:106 | as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances” | Temurah 3b:18 | The Talmud asks: Isn’t <b>that</b> verse <b>required</b> as a source <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav? As Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is permitted for one to <b>take an oath</b> obligating himself <b>to fulfill the mitzvot? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). The Talmud counters that there is another source: <b>Isn’t another verse written: </b> “You shall fear YHWH your God; Him you shall serve; <b>and to Him you shall cleave, and by His name you shall swear”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:20). This second verse teaches that it is permitted for one to take a truthful oath. |
| Psalms 119:126 | it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The rabbis also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, YHWH is with you, and they said to him, May YHWH bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says: </b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for YHWH; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>R' Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for YHWH, ”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| Psalms 119:126 | states: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah” | Berakhot 63a:8 | <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “It is time to work for YHWH; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). Of this, <b>Rava said: This verse</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end, and</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning. </b> |
| Psalms 119:126 | “It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified your Torah” | Gittin 60a:6 | And a proof for this is <b>that R' Yoḥanan and R' Shimon ben Lakish used to read from a scroll of <i>aggada</i></b> containing the words of the rabbis <b>on Shabbat. But</b> such a scroll <b>may not be written, </b> for in principle, the statements of the Oral Law may not be committed to writing. <b>Rather, since it is not possible</b> to remember the Oral Law without writing it down, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i>, as indicated by the verse: <b>“It is time to act for YHWH; they have nullified your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). <b>Here too, </b> in the case of a <i>haftara</i> scroll, <b>since it is not</b> always <b>possible</b> to write complete books of the Bible, due to the expense, it is permitted to apply the reasoning of <b>“It is time to act for YHWH; they have nullified your Torah. ”</b> |
| Psalms 119:126 | “It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified Your Torah” | Tamid 27b:8 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he did in fact wear consecrated priestly vestments. Although this is usually prohibited, in this instance it was permitted due to the principle: <b>“It is time to act for YHWH; they have nullified Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). In times of great need, such as when one seeks to prevent the destruction of the Temple, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i> for the sake of Heaven, and the actions of Shimon HaTzaddik indeed averted the destruction. |
| Psalms 119:126 | “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void your Torah” | Temurah 14b:5 | <b>They said</b> in response to the question of how Rav Dimi could propose writing down the <i>halakha</i> in a letter: <b>Perhaps</b> with regard to <b>a new matter</b> it <b>is different, </b> i.e., it might be permitted to write down new material so that it not be forgotten. One proof for this suggestion is <b>that R' Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> would <b>read from a scroll of <i>aggada</i>, </b> containing the words of the rabbis, <b>on Shabbat. And</b> they did so because <b>they taught as follows: </b> Since one cannot remember the Oral Law without writing it down, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i>, as derived from the verse: <b>“It is time to work for YHWH; they have made void your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). <b>They said it is better to uproot</b> a single <i>halakha</i> of the <b>Torah, </b> i.e., the prohibition of writing down the Oral Torah, <b>and</b> thereby ensure <b>that the Torah is not forgotten from the Jewish people</b> entirely. |
| Psalms 119:126 | “It is time to act for the Lord, they have nullified your Torah” | Yoma 69a:14 | It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that Shimon HaTzaddik wore the priestly vestments even outside the Temple. This would seem to be in contravention of the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> prohibiting this. The Talmud resolves the contradiction: <b>If you wish, say</b> Shimon HaTzaddik did not wear a set of genuine, sanctified priestly vestments; rather, he wore garments that were <b>fitting to be priestly vestments</b> in that they were made of the same material and design. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he indeed wore a set of genuine priestly vestments, but in times of great need, such as when one seeks to prevent the destruction of the Temple, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i>, as indicated by the verse: <b>“It is time to act for YHWH, they have nullified your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). |
| Psalms 119:147 | Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the neshef and cried, | Berakhot 3b:20 | Incidental to the Talmud’s mention of King David, other sources are cited that describe his actions. Regarding that which was cited above, that he would rise in the middle of the night in order to serve his Creator, the Talmud asks: <b>Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried, </b> I hoped for Your word” (Psalms 119:147). <b>And how</b> do we know <b>that this <i>neshef</i> is the evening? As it is written: “In the <i>neshef</i>, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness”</b> (Proverbs 7:9). Apparently, King David did indeed rise when it was still evening. |
| Psalms 119:148 | and the other verse says: “My eyes forestall the watches, | Berakhot 3b:14 | <b>What is R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>reasoning? R' Zerika said</b> that <b>R' Ami said</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion is based on a comparison of two verses. <b>One verse says: “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws”</b> (Psalms 119:62), <b>and the other verse says: “My eyes forestall the watches, </b> that I will speak of Your word” (Psalms 119:148). Taken together, these verses indicate that their author, King David, rose at midnight, two watches before dawn, in order to study Torah. <b>How is it</b> possible to reconcile these two verses? Only if <b>there are four watches in the night</b> does one who rises two watches before dawn rise at midnight. |
| Psalms 119:160 | from here: “The beginning of Your word is truth” | Kiddushin 31a:7 | <b>Once He said: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>they returned and conceded</b> the truth <b>of the first statements, </b> which is why the verse uses the plural expression: “Words of Your mouth,” i.e., all the words of God’s mouth. <b>Rava said: </b> This can be derived <b>from here: “The beginning of Your word is truth”</b> (Psalms 119:160). Is <b>the beginning of Your word</b> truth <b>but not the end of Your word? Rather, from the end of Your word it is apparent</b> to everyone <b>that the beginning of Your word is truth. </b> |
| Psalms 119:162 | And similarly it says: “I rejoice [ sas ] at Your word” | Megillah 16b:8 | § The Talmud returns to its explanation of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor”</b> (Esther 8:16). <b>Rav Yehuda said: “Light”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that they once again studied. <b>And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>“Gladness” [<i>simḥa</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festivals</b> that they once again observed. <b>And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [<i>vesamakhta</i>] on your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>“Joy” [<i>sasson</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision, </b> as they once again circumcised their sons. <b>And similarly it says: “I rejoice [<i>sas</i>] at Your word”</b> (Psalms 119:162), which the rabbis understood as referring to David’s rejoicing over the mitzva of circumcision. |
| Psalms 119:162 | accepted upon themselves with joy, such as circumcision, as it is written: “I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great spoil” | Shabbat 130a:13 | Apropos affection for the mitzva of circumcision, the Talmud cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>it was taught</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Every mitzva that</b> the Jews initially <b>accepted upon themselves with joy, such as circumcision, as it is written: “I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great spoil”</b> (Psalms 119:162), and as the rabbis explained, this “word” refers to the mitzva of circumcision, over which they rejoiced, <b>they still perform</b> it <b>with joy. And every mitzva that</b> the Jews initially <b>accepted upon themselves with contentiousness</b> and regret, <b>such as</b> the prohibition against <b>incestuous sex, as it is written: “And Moses heard the people weeping, family by family”</b> (Numbers 11:10), and as the rabbis interpreted homiletically: They wept <b>over matters</b> pertaining to <b>their families, </b> as they were prohibited at that time from marrying family members, <b>they still perform with contentiousness. </b> The fact is <b>that there is no marriage contract</b> and wedding <b>in which contentiousness does not arise, </b> as there is inevitably some conflict between the parties. The <i>baraita</i> asserts that this is because, initially, the Jews did not accept the laws governing marriage and family relationships willingly. |
| Psalms 119:164 | phylacteries on their heads, and phylacteries on their arms, and ritual fringes on their garments, and a mezuza for their doorways. Concerning them David said: “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous ordinances” | Menachot 43b:10 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people are beloved, as God surrounded them with mitzvot: </b> They have <b>tefillin on their heads, and tefillin on their arms, and ritual fringes on their garments, and a <i>mezuza</i> for their doorways. Concerning them David said: “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:164). This alludes to the two tefillin, the four ritual fringes, and the <i>mezuza</i>, which total seven. |
| Psalms 119:165 | “Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The rabbis interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. </b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of YHWH, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May YHWH give strength to His people; YHWH will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 119:165 | peace is written, as it is written: “Great peace have they who love Your Torah; | Sanhedrin 98a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Nor was there peace from the oppressor to him who exits and to him who enters”? Rav says: </b> It means that <b>even</b> for <b>Torah scholars, with regard to whom</b> the promise of <b>peace is written, as it is written: “Great peace have they who love Your Torah; </b> and there is no obstacle for them” (Psalms 119:165), <b>there will be no peace from the oppressor. And Shmuel says: </b> It means that the Messiah will not come <b>until all the prices are equal. </b> |
| Psalms 119:176 | as it is written: “I have gone astray like a lost lamb; seek Your servant” | Makkot 24a:32 | <b>Rav says: I am afraid of that verse: “And you shall be lost among the nations. ” Rav Pappa objects to this: Perhaps</b> it means that the Jewish people will be <b>like a lost item that is sought</b> by its owner, and God will restore those lost in exile, <b>as it is written: “I have gone astray like a lost lamb; seek Your servant”</b> (Psalms 119:176). <b>Rather, </b> Rav was afraid <b>from</b> that which is written in <b>the latter</b> portion <b>of that verse, </b> where it is written: <b>“And the land of your enemies shall consume you. ” Mar Zutra objects to this: Perhaps</b> it means <b>like the consumption of cucumbers and gourds, </b> which are not consumed in their entirety. Some is left over, from which additional plants can grow. |
| Psalms 119:176 | as it is stated: “I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek out your servant, for I do not forget your mitzvot” | Sanhedrin 109b:12 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:9): The members of <b>the assembly of Korah have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the earth closed upon them”</b> (Numbers 16:33), meaning <b>in this world, </b> and also: <b>“And they perished from among the assembly”</b> (Numbers 16:33), meaning <b>in the World-to-Come; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: </b> Although it says that they perished, <b>they are like a lost item that is sought, </b> ultimately found, and rehabilitated, <b>as it is stated: “I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek out your servant, for I do not forget your mitzvot”</b> (Psalms 119:176). |
| Psalms 120:1 | “In my distress I called to the Lord and He answered me” | Taanit 15a:7 | <b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before the</b> congregation: The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings, <b>and they are</b> as follows: The special series of blessings recited on Rosh HaShana, the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i>; </b> and the sections of Psalms that begin with the verses: <b>“In my distress I called to YHWH and He answered me”</b> (Psalms 120:1), <b>“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; </b> from where will my help come” (Psalms 121:1), <b>“Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1), and <b>“A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints”</b> (Psalms 102:1). |
| Psalms 120:3 | which is written: “What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done for you, you deceitful tongue” | Arakhin 15b:5 | § The Talmud returns to the topic of malicious speech. <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Yosei ben Zimra: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done for you, you deceitful tongue”</b> (Psalms 120:3)? <b>God said to the tongue: All the</b> other <b>limbs of a person are upright, but you are lying</b> horizontally. <b>All the</b> other <b>limbs of a person are external, but you are internal.

| Psalms 120:4 | As it is stated: “Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom” | Arakhin 15b:14 | <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, the Holy One Blessed be He says</b> about him <b>to Gehenna: I</b> will be <b>on him from above, and you</b> will be <b>on him from below, </b> and together <b>we will judge him</b> and punish him. <b>As it is stated: “Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom”</b> (Psalms 120:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>“arrow”</b> means <b>nothing other than the tongue, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit. </b> One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait for him” (Jeremiah 9:7). |
| Psalms 120:4 | And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty” | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister, </b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Psalms 121:1 | “I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; | Taanit 15a:7 | <b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before the</b> congregation: The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings, <b>and they are</b> as follows: The special series of blessings recited on Rosh HaShana, the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i>; </b> and the sections of Psalms that begin with the verses: <b>“In my distress I called to YHWH and He answered me”</b> (Psalms 120:1), <b>“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; </b> from where will my help come” (Psalms 121:1), <b>“Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1), and <b>“A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints”</b> (Psalms 102:1). |
| Psalms 121:4 | But isn’t it already stated: “Behold, He that keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” | Sotah 48a:7 | § The Mishnah further taught: <b>He also nullified</b> the actions of <b>the awakeners. </b> The Talmud poses a question: <b>What</b> are <b>awakeners? Raḥava says: On each and every day when the Levites stood on the platform</b> in the Temple <b>they</b> would <b>say: “Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? ”</b> (Psalms 44:24). Therefore, they were called awakeners. Yoḥanan the High Priest <b>said to them: Does God sleep, </b> that you call upon Him to awaken? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “Behold, He that keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”</b> (Psalms 121:4)? <b>Rather, when the Jewish people are in a state of suffering, and the nations of the world are in</b> a state of <b>calm and serenity, </b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>it is stated: “Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? ”</b> If the verse were to be recited every morning it would be interpreted in the wrong way, so Yoḥanan the High Priest therefore canceled the daily recitation of this verse. |
| Psalms 121:5 | and He protects them from the outside. As it is stated: “The Lord is your keeper, the Lord is your shade upon your right hand” | Menachot 33b:3 | The Talmud adds: <b>R' Ḥanina says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is not like the attribute of God. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that <b>a king sits inside</b> his palace, <b>and</b> the <b>people protect him from the outside, </b> whereas with regard to <b>the attribute of God, </b> it is <b>not so. </b> Rather, <b>His servants, </b> the Jewish people, <b>sit inside</b> their homes, <b>and He protects them from the outside. As it is stated: “YHWH is your keeper, YHWH is your shade upon your right hand”</b> (Psalms 121:5). |
| Psalms 121:8 | and He guards over them outside. As it is stated: “The Lord shall guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever” | Avodah Zarah11a:5 | Onkelos <b>said to them: The</b> standard <b>practice</b> throughout the <b>world</b> is that <b>a king</b> of <b>flesh and blood sits inside</b> his palace, <b>and his servants</b> stand <b>guard, </b> protecting <b>him outside; but</b> with regard to <b>God His servants, </b> the Jewish people, sit <b>inside</b> their homes <b>and He guards over them outside. As it is stated: “YHWH shall guard your going out and your coming in, from now and forever”</b> (Psalms 121:8). Upon hearing this, those soldiers also <b>converted</b> to Judaism.

| Psalms 122:1 | which is written: “A song of the ascents to David: I rejoiced when they said to me, let us go to the house of God” | Makkot 10a:23 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A song of the ascents to David: I rejoiced when they said to me, let us go to the house of God”</b> (Psalms 122:1)? <b>David said before God: God!, I heard people who were saying</b> in reference to me: <b>When will this old man die, and Solomon his son will come</b> and succeed him <b>and build the Temple and we will ascend</b> there <b>for the pilgrimage Festival? </b> It was common knowledge that the Temple would be constructed by David’s successor. David continued: <b>And</b> despite my pain that I am not privileged to build the Temple, <b>I rejoiced. God said to him: “For better is one day in your courtyard than one thousand”</b> (Psalms 84:11), meaning, <b>I prefer one day</b> during <b>which you engage in</b> the study of <b>Torah before Me than</b> the <b>one thousand burnt-offerings that your son Solomon is destined to sacrifice before Me upon the altar</b> (see I Kings 3:4). |
| Psalms 122:2 | which is written: “Our feet were standing in your gates, Jerusalem” | Makkot 10a:22 | Apropos the virtue of Torah study, <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Our feet were standing in your gates, Jerusalem”</b> (Psalms 122:2)? <b>What caused our feet to withstand</b> the enemies <b>in war? </b> It is <b>the gates of Jerusalem, where they were engaged in Torah</b> study. He interprets the term “in your gates” to mean: Because of your gates, the place of justice and Torah. |
| Psalms 122:3 | Yes, as it is written: “Jerusalem built up, a city unified together” | Taanit 5a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>And is there</b> such a place as <b>Jerusalem above? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, as it is written: “Jerusalem built up, a city unified together”</b> (Psalms 122:3). The term unified indicates that there are two cities of Jerusalem, a heavenly one and an earthly one, which are bound together. |
| Psalms 122:4 | as it is stated: “The tribes of the Lord, as a testimony to Israel” | Kiddushin 70b:12 | § The Talmud discusses an idea raised earlier. <b>R' Avin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> Concerning <b>anyone who marries a woman who is not suited for him</b> to marry, <b>when God rests His Shekhina</b> upon the Jewish people, <b>He testifies with regard to all the tribes</b> that they are His people, <b>but He does not testify with regard to he</b> who married improperly, <b>as it is stated: “The tribes of YHWH, as a testimony to Israel”</b> (Psalms 122:4). <b>When is it a testimony to Israel? When the tribes are the tribes of YHWH, </b> but not when their lineage is flawed. |
| Psalms 122:6 | be exalted? In Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they who love you shall prosper” | Megillah 17b:19 | <b>And where will the horns</b> of the righteous <b>be exalted? In Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they who love you shall prosper”</b> (Psalms 122:6). “They who love you” are the righteous. Therefore, the blessing of the rebuilding of Jerusalem is placed after the blessing of the righteous. |
| Psalms 122:7 | “May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces” | Berakhot 64a:14 | The rabbis interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. </b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of YHWH, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May YHWH give strength to His people; YHWH will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11). |
| Psalms 125:1 | inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion, | Berakhot 58b:4 | Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: You have nothing about which to sigh, as <b>R' Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said YHWH of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant”</b> (Isaiah 5:9). <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: </b> In the <b>future, </b> in the end of days, <b>God will restore them to their</b> original locations and their <b>inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David. They who trust in YHWH are as Mount Zion, </b> which cannot be moved but abides forever” (Psalms 125:1). From this verse one may infer that <b>just as in the future God will restore Mount Zion to its inhabited state, so too, in the future God will restore the houses of the righteous to their inhabited state, </b> so you have no reason to sigh. <b>Seeing that he was still not satisfied, </b> Ulla <b>said to him: It is enough for a servant to be like his master. </b> Since God leaves His home, the Holy Temple, in ruins, one should not be distraught over the destruction of the houses of the righteous. |
| Psalms 125:3 | matches a woman to a man only according to his actions, as it is stated: “For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous” | Sotah 2a:8 | <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: When Reish Lakish would introduce</b> his discussion of the Torah passage <b>of <i>sota</i></b> he would <b>say this: </b> Heaven <b>matches a woman to a man only according to his actions, as it is stated: “For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 125:3), indicating that if one has a wicked wife it is due to his own evil conduct. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: And it is as difficult to match</b> a couple together <b>as</b> was <b>the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated</b> in a verse that speaks of the exodus from Egypt: <b>“God makes the solitary individuals dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity [<i>bakosharot</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:7). God takes single individuals and causes them to dwell in a house by properly matching a man to a woman. This is similar to the exodus from Egypt, which culminated in the splitting of the Red Sea, where He released prisoners into prosperity. |
| Psalms 125:4 | “Do good, Lord, to the good ones” | Menachot 53b:3 | R' Ezra stated another, similar homily: <b>Let the good one come and receive the good from the Good for the good ones. </b> He explained: <b>Let the good one come; this</b> good <b>is Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“And when she saw him that he was a goodly child”</b> (Exodus 2:2). <b>And receive the good; this</b> good <b>is</b> the <b>Torah, as it is written</b> about the Torah: <b>“For I give you a good doctrine; </b> do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2). <b>From the Good; this is</b> referring to <b>God as it is written: “YHWH is good to all”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>For the good ones; these</b> good ones <b>are the Jews, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“Do good, Lord, to the good ones”</b> (Psalms 125:4). |
| Psalms 125:5 | fall in Gehenna, as it is stated: “But those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord will lead them away with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel” | Berakhot 19a:5 | R' Yehoshua <b>ben Levi said</b> similarly: <b>One who speaks</b> disparagingly <b>after the biers of Torah scholars</b> and maligns them after their death will <b>fall in Gehenna, as it is stated: “But those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, YHWH will lead them away with the workers of iniquity; peace be upon Israel”</b> (Psalms 125:5). <b>Even</b> if he speaks ill of them <b>when there is peace upon Israel, </b> after death, when they are no longer able to fight those denouncing them (<i>Tosafot</i>); nevertheless <b>YHWH will lead them away with the workers of iniquity, </b> to Gehenna. |
| Psalms 126:1 | as it is stated: | Berakhot 31a:4 | In a similar vein, <b>R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is forbidden to fill his mouth with mirth in this world, </b> as long as we are in exile (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>as it is stated: </b> “When YHWH returns the captivity of Zion we will be as dreamers” (Psalms 126:1). Only <b>“then will our mouths fill with laughter and our lips with song”</b> (Psalms 126:2). <b>When</b> will that joyous era arrive? When <b>“they will say among nations, YHWH has done great things with these”</b> (Psalms 126:2). <b>They said about Reish Lakish that throughout his life he did not fill his mouth with laughter in this world once he heard this</b> statement <b>from his teacher, R' Yoḥanan. </b> |
| Psalms 126:1 | this verse: “A song of Ascents: When the Lord brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream” | Taanit 23a:14 | § The Talmud relates another story about Ḥoni HaMe’aggel. <b>R' Yoḥanan said: All the days</b> of the life <b>of that righteous man, </b> Ḥoni, <b>he was distressed over</b> the meaning of <b>this verse: “A song of Ascents: When YHWH brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream”</b> (Psalms 126:1). <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>Is there</b> really a person <b>who can sleep and dream for seventy years? </b> How is it possible to compare the seventy-year exile in Babylonia to a dream? |
| Psalms 126:2 | “then will our mouths fill with laughter and our lips with song” | Berakhot 31a:4 | In a similar vein, <b>R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is forbidden to fill his mouth with mirth in this world, </b> as long as we are in exile (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>as it is stated: </b> “When YHWH returns the captivity of Zion we will be as dreamers” (Psalms 126:1).

| Psalms 126:4 | mnemonic: Ingathering; armies; charity; tithe; sustainer. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is as great as the day of the ingathering of the exiles, as it is stated: “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the dry land” | Taanit 8b:15 | § The Talmud cites five statements of R' Yoḥanan, in accordance with the following <b>mnemonic: Ingathering; armies; charity; tithe; sustainer. R' Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is as great as the day of the ingathering of the exiles, as it is stated: “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the dry land”</b> (Psalms 126:4), <b>and “streams”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>rain, as it is stated: “And the streams of the sea appeared”</b> (II Samuel 22:16). |
| Psalms 126:6 | joy. Though he goes on his way weeping, who bears the measure of seed, | Taanit 5a:7 | <b>And with regard to that generation</b> the verse <b>says: “They who sow in tears shall reap with</b> songs of <b>joy. Though he goes on his way weeping, who bears the measure of seed, </b> he shall come home with joy, bearing his sheaves” (Psalms 126:6). The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>“Though he goes on his way weeping, who bears</b> the measure of seed”? <b>R' Yehuda said: An ox, when it plowed</b> at that time, <b>it went</b> on its way <b>weeping</b> and lamenting its labor; <b>and</b> yet <b>upon its return, </b> through the same furrow, <b>it</b> was able to <b>eat the young shoots [<i>ḥaziz</i>]</b> of crops that had already sprouted <b>from the furrow. And this is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“He shall come home with</b> songs of <b>joy. ”</b> |
| Psalms 127:1 | “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it; | Yoma 19b:14 | The Mishnah continues: <b>And they</b> would <b>engage him</b> in different ways <b>until the time to slaughter the</b> daily offering <b>would arrive. </b> It was <b>taught: They would not occupy him with a harp or a lyre, </b> which may not be played on a Festival, <b>but</b> would sing <b>with</b> their <b>mouths. And what would they say? </b> They would say this verse: <b>“Unless YHWH builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it; </b> unless YHWH watches over the city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain” (Psalms 127:1). The message to the High Priest was that his service must be performed for the sake of Heaven for it to be accepted by God; otherwise his efforts would be in vain. |
| Psalms 127:2 | those about whom it is written: “It is vain for you to rise early and sit up late, you that eat the bread of toil, so He gives to His beloved in sleep” | Ketubot 62a:6 | § The Mishnah said that <b>men of leisure</b> must engage in marital sex with their wives <b>every day. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is meant by the term <b>men of leisure? Rava said: </b> These are <b>students</b> of Torah who go daily to review <b>their lectures</b> at a local study hall and return home each evening. <b>Abaye said to him: </b> Wives of Torah scholars are <b>those about whom it is written: “It is vain for you to rise early and sit up late, you that eat the bread of toil, so He gives to His beloved in sleep”</b> (Psalms 127:2), <b>and R' Yitzḥak said</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>These are the wives of Torah scholars who deprive their eyes of sleep in this world and reach the life of the World-to-Come. </b> This indicates that Torah scholars exert themselves greatly in their studies and are not home in the evenings, <b>and you say</b> that the <b>students</b> reviewing <b>their lectures</b> are men of leisure, whose wives have conjugal rights for every night? |
| Psalms 127:2 | Gabriel stood from behind the curtain and said: “It is vain for you who rise early who sit up late to eat the bread of sorrow, for He gives His beloved sleep” | Yoma 77a:6 | The ministering angel of the Persians <b>said: Write for me that the Jews</b> must pay <b>taxes [<i>akarga</i>]</b> to the Persians. <b>They wrote it for him</b> as he asked. He said: <b>Write for me that the rabbis</b> must pay <b>taxes. They wrote</b> this <b>for him. When they wanted to sign</b> the documents, <b>Gabriel stood from behind the curtain and said: “It is vain for you who rise early who sit up late to eat the bread of sorrow, for He gives His beloved sleep”</b> (Psalms 127:2). <b>What</b> does <b>“for He gives His beloved sleep”</b> mean? <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: These are the wives of Torah scholars who disturb</b> their <b>sleep in this world</b> by staying up waiting for their husbands, who rise early and return late from learning Torah, <b>and</b> they thereby <b>merit the World-to-Come. </b> Gabriel asked: Is this the reward they deserve, to pay more taxes? <b>They did not listen to</b> Gabriel. |
| Psalms 127:3 | from the One to Whom sons belong, as it is stated: “Behold, children are a heritage of the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward” | Niddah 71a:2 | The rabbis of Alexandria <b>said</b> to R' Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them. </b> R' Yehoshua said: <b>Rather, they should pray</b> to receive sons <b>from the One to Whom sons belong, as it is stated: “Behold, children are a heritage of YHWH; the fruit of the womb is a reward”</b> (Psalms 127:3). |
| Psalms 127:3 | “The fruit of the womb is a reward” | Niddah 71a:4 | With regard to the verse from Psalms, the Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“The fruit of the womb is a reward”</b> (Psalms 127:3)? What act is rewarded here? <b>R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says: In reward for</b> men <b>withholding their</b> semen <b>in their belly in order</b> to allow <b>their wives to emit seed first, God gives him the reward of the fruit of the womb, </b> i.e., sons. |
| Psalms 127:3 | “the portion of the Lord is children” | Shabbat 152a:6 | The apostate <b>saw that</b> R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa <b>was not wearing shoes. </b> He <b>said to him: </b> One who rides <b>on a horse</b> is a <b>king. </b> One who rides <b>on a donkey</b> is <b>a free man. And one who wears shoes is</b> at least <b>a human being. </b> One who does <b>neither this nor that, </b> someone <b>who is buried</b> in the earth <b>is better than him. He said to him: Eunuch, eunuch, you said to me three things, </b> and now <b>hear three</b> things: <b>The glory of a face is the beard, the joy of the heart is a wife, </b> and <b>“the portion of YHWH is children”</b> (Psalms 127:3); <b>blessed is God who has denied you all of them, </b> for a eunuch does not have a beard, a wife or children. <b>He said to him: </b> Does <b>a bald man quarrel? He said to him: </b> Does <b>a castrated male goat</b> speak words of <b>rebuke? </b> |
| Psalms 127:4 | And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth” | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister, </b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Psalms 127:5 | And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate” | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister, </b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Psalms 128:2 | while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you” | Berakhot 8a:21 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears YHWH, </b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Talmud explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him. </b> |
| Psalms 128:2 | about him the verse states: “When you eat the labor of your hands, happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you” | Chullin 44b:11 | <b>Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Anyone who reads</b> the Torah <b>and studies</b> the Mishnah, <b>and sees his own <i>tereifa</i>, and has served Torah scholars</b> to learn the ways of halakhic judgment, <b>about him the verse states: “When you eat the labor of your hands, happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). <b>Rav Zevid says: </b> Such a person <b>merits inheriting two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come. </b> When the verse states: <b>“Happy shall you be, ”</b> it means <b>in this world, </b> and when it states: <b>“And it shall be well with you, ”</b> it is referring <b>to the World-to-Come. </b> |
| Psalms 128:3 | his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine, | Berakhot 57a:6 | <b>One who sees a vine laden</b> with grapes <b>in a dream, </b> it is an omen that <b>his wife will not miscarry, as it is stated: “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine, </b> in the innermost parts of your house” (Psalms 128:3). One who sees <b>a</b> planted <b>vine branch</b> in a dream <b>should anticipate the Messiah, as it is stated: “Binding his foal unto the vine and his donkey’s colt unto the vine branch”</b> (Genesis 49:11). |
| Psalms 128:3 | he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants, | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream, </b> and they were <b>small, </b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives. </b> However, the Talmud adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but, </b> one who sees olive <b>trees, </b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants, </b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream, </b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated: </b> “YHWH called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Talmud likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Psalms 128:4 | in a baraita : “Behold, surely thus shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed” | Sotah 40a:1 | <b>During the closing prayer [<i>ne’ila</i>] of Yom Kippur, </b> which also includes the Priestly Benediction, <b>what do</b> the people <b>say?

| Psalms 128:6 | “And see your son’s sons; peace be upon Israel” | Ketubot 50a:14 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And see your son’s sons; peace be upon Israel”</b> (Psalms 128:6), <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: Once your children</b> have <b>children</b> of their own, there is <b>peace upon Israel, as they will not come</b> to require <b>the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>] or levirate marriage, </b> which are necessary only if a man dies childless. <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Once your sons</b> have <b>sons</b> there will be <b>peace upon the judges of Israel, as</b> relatives <b>will not come to quarrel</b> with the judges over the inheritance. |

| Psalms 130:1 | in a low place and pray, as it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths” | Berakhot 10b:26 | With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of prayer, <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, said in the name of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov: A person should not stand in a high place and pray; rather, </b> he should stand <b>in a low place and pray, as it is stated: “I called to You, Lord, from the depths”</b> (Psalms 130:1). |
| Psalms 130:1 | “Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord” | Taanit 15a:7 | <b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before the</b> congregation: The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings, <b>and they are</b> as follows: The special series of blessings recited on Rosh HaShana, the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i>; </b> and the sections of Psalms that begin with the verses: <b>“In my distress I called to YHWH and He answered me”</b> (Psalms 120:1), <b>“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; </b> from where will my help come” (Psalms 121:1), <b>“Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1), and <b>“A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints”</b> (Psalms 102:1). |
| Psalms 130:1 | Give me my sack [ gevalki ] and I will go and buy myself a dinar of grain. When he went outside, he went and stood in a low place, as it is written: “Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord” | Taanit 23b:10 | By contrast, <b>the powerful men of Eretz Yisrael, such as R' Yona, the father of R' Mani, </b> acted differently. <b>When the world was in need of rain, he enters his house and say to</b> his household: <b>Give me my sack [<i>gevalki</i>] and I will go and buy myself a dinar of grain. When he went outside, he went and stood in a low place, as it is written: “Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1). <b>And he would stand in a secluded place, and cover</b> himself <b>with sackcloth, and pray for mercy, and rain would come.

He said to them: I said</b> to myself, <b>since rain has</b> now <b>come, </b> there will be <b>relief in the world</b> and prices will soon go down. In this manner, he hid his greatness even from his own household. |
| Psalms 132:6 | “We heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood” | Zevachim 54b:9 | The verse following those verses states: <b>“We heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood”</b> (Psalms 132:6). Rava explains the meaning of these words: <b>“In Ephrath”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Joshua, who came from</b> the tribe of <b>Ephraim. </b> This alludes to the fact that David and Samuel were able to locate the highest place in Eretz Yisrael based on the book of Joshua. <b>“We found it in the field of the wood”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Benjamin, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; </b> in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27).

| Psalms 132:13 | One verse states: “For the Lord has chosen Zion; | Niddah 70b:6 | The rabbis of Alexandria further asked: <b>One verse states: “For YHWH has chosen Zion; </b> He has desired it for His dwelling place” (Psalms 132:13), <b>and one verse states: “For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it until this day, </b> so that I should remove it from before My face” (Jeremiah 32:31). R' Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here, </b> the verse in Psalms is referring to the time <b>before Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter</b> (see I Kings 3:1), whereas <b>there, </b> the verse in Jeremiah is speaking of the time <b>after Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter. </b> |
| Psalms 132:13 | “For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation” | Zevachim 119a:11 | By contrast, <b>R' Shimon says: </b> With regard to <b>“rest, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem, </b> and with regard to <b>“inheritance, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>Shiloh.

| Psalms 133:1 | A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity” | Horayot 12a:8 | <b>And still Aaron was concerned. He said: Perhaps Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property; <b>but</b> perhaps <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, as the additional oil is on my beard and I enjoy it. <b>A bat kol emerged and said: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity”</b> (Psalms 133:1). <b>Just as</b> your brother <b>Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property, <b>so too, you did not misuse</b> consecrated property. |
| Psalms 133:1 | A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity” | Keritot 5b:26 | <b>And still Aaron himself was concerned, </b> thinking: <b>Perhaps Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property <b>but I misused</b> the oil, as the additional oil is on my body and I derive benefit from it. <b>A bat kol emerged and said to him: “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity”</b> (Psalms 133:1). <b>Just as</b> your brother <b>Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property, <b>so too, you did not misuse</b> consecrated property. |
| Psalms 133:2 | The Sages taught: “It is like the precious oil upon the head coming down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, | Horayot 12a:7 | <b>A baraita states: “It is like the precious oil upon the head coming down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, </b> that comes down upon the collar of his garments” (Psalms 133:2). <b>Two drops</b> of anointing oil, <b>shaped like pearls, were suspended for Aaron from his beard.

This analogy teaches: <b>Just as there is no misuse of the dew of Hermon, </b> which is not consecrated, <b>so too, </b> with regard to <b>the anointing oil that is on Aaron’s beard, there is no misuse</b> of consecrated property. |
| Psalms 133:2 | “It is like the precious oil upon the head | Keritot 5b:24 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“It is like the precious oil upon the head</b> descending upon the beard; the beard of Aaron, that descends upon the collar of his garments” (Psalms 133:2). <b>Two drops</b> of anointing oil shaped <b>like pearls hung from Aaron’s beard.

| Psalms 134:2 | as it is stated: “Lift up [ se’u ] your hands in sanctity and bless the Lord” | Sotah 39a:3 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who did not</b> first <b>wash his hands may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction; <b>as it is stated: “Lift up [<i>se’u</i>] your hands in sanctity and bless YHWH”</b> (Psalms 134:2), which teaches that before reciting the benediction one must sanctify his hands by washing them. |

| Psalms 134:3 | “The Lord shall bless you out of Zion” | Sotah 39b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let them also say</b> the 3rd verse that appears right after the first two blessings: <b>“YHWH shall bless you out of Zion”</b> (Psalms 134:3), <b>as it is written in that</b> same <b>matter.

| Psalms 135:2 | “You who stand in the house of the Lord” | Pesachim 117a:22 | <b>Rav Ḥanin bar Rava said: Everyone concedes</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“My mouth shall speak the praise of YHWH; and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever”</b> (Psalms 145:21), that the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows, </b> the opening word of the subsequent psalm, marks <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter, </b> not the conclusion of the previous one. Likewise, with regard to the verse: <b>“The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish”</b> (Psalms 112:10), the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows it, </b> is <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter.

| Psalms 135:4 | until “The rivers of Babylon.” Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From “For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself” | Pesachim 118a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where</b> does the <b>great <i>hallel</i></b> begin and where does it end? <b>R' Yehuda says: From “Give thanks”</b> (Psalms 136:1) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon”</b> (Psalms 137:1). <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: From “A song of ascents”</b> (Psalms 134:1) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon. ” Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From “For YHWH has chosen Jacob for Himself”</b> (Psalms 135:4) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon. ”</b> |
| Psalms 135:7 | written: “He makes lightning for the rain” | Berakhot 59a:13 | We learned in the Mishnah that <b>over mountains and hills</b> one recites: Blessed…Author of creation. The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that all those that we mentioned until now, </b> such as lightning, <b>are not acts of creation? </b> Among God’s praise for creation of the world and forming the mountains, <b>is it not</b> also <b>written: “He makes lightning for the rain”</b> (Psalms 135:7)? <b>Abaye said: Combine</b> the two statements and <b>teach that</b> in all the cases in our Mishnah, one recites these two blessings. <b>Rava said: There, </b> over lightning and thunder, <b>one recites two</b> blessings: <b>Blessed…Whose power fills the world, and: Author of creation.

| Psalms 136:1 | Rabbi Yehuda says: From “Give thanks” | Pesachim 118a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where</b> does the <b>great <i>hallel</i></b> begin and where does it end? <b>R' Yehuda says: From “Give thanks”</b> (Psalms 136:1) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon”</b> (Psalms 137:1). <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: From “A song of ascents”</b> (Psalms 134:1) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon. ” Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From “For YHWH has chosen Jacob for Himself”</b> (Psalms 135:4) <b>until “The rivers of Babylon. ”</b> |
| Psalms 136:1 | which is written: “Give thanks to the Lord for He is good” | Pesachim 118a:5 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Give thanks to YHWH for He is good”</b> (Psalms 136:1)? It means <b>give thanks to YHWH who exacts one’s debt, </b> the punishment for a person’s sins and wickedness, <b>in</b> accordance with the <b>goodness of</b> each individual. God punishes each person based on his means. He punishes <b>a wealthy</b> person by taking <b>his ox, and</b> He punishes <b>a poor</b> person by means of <b>his sheep. </b> He punishes the <b>orphan by</b> taking away <b>his egg, </b> and He punishes the <b>widow by</b> means of <b>her chicken. </b> God punishes each person based on his ability to endure deprivation, and He does not punish people with more than they can handle. |
| Psalms 136:6 | upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters” | Chagigah 12b:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says: Woe to them, the creations, who see and know not what they see; </b> who <b>stand and know not upon what they stand. </b> He clarifies: <b>Upon what does the earth stand? Upon pillars, as it is stated: “Who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble”</b> (Job 9:6). These <b>pillars</b> are positioned <b>upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters”</b> (Psalms 136:6). These <b>waters</b> stand <b>upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains”</b> (Psalms 104:6). The <b>mountains</b> are upon the <b>wind, as it is stated: “For behold He forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). The <b>wind</b> is <b>upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word”</b> (Psalms 148:8). The <b>storm hangs upon the arm of God as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), which demonstrates that the entire world rests upon the arms of God. |
| Psalms 136:13 | “To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder, | Pesachim 118a:10 | <b>Rav Sheizvi said, citing R' Elazar ben Azarya: </b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “He gives food to all flesh, </b> for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:25), <b>and juxtaposed to it is</b> the verse: <b>“To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder, </b> for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:13).

| Psalms 136:25 | “Who provides food to all flesh, | Berakhot 4b:19 | <b>Rather, </b> if you suggest that this particular chapter is recited <b>because it contains</b> praise for God’s provision of sustenance to all of creation: <b>“You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16), then <b>let him recite the great <i>hallel</i></b> (Psalms 136), <b>in which</b> numerous praises are <b>written, </b> including: <b>“Who provides food to all flesh, </b> Whose kindness endures forever” (Psalms 136:25). |
| Psalms 136:25 | a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “He gives food to all flesh, | Pesachim 118a:10 | <b>Rav Sheizvi said, citing R' Elazar ben Azarya: </b> The task of providing <b>a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “He gives food to all flesh, </b> for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:25), <b>and juxtaposed to it is</b> the verse: <b>“To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder, </b> for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:13).

| Psalms 136:25 | great hallel , | Pesachim 118a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And since there is</b> the <b>great <i>hallel</i>, </b> which contains the special praise of “Who gives food to all flesh” (Psalms 136:25), as explained above, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>one</b> also <b>recites this</b> <i>hallel</i> of Psalms 113–118, the section recited on every joyous occasion? The Talmud answers: The reason is <b>because</b> the regular <i>hallel</i> <b>contains these five matters: </b> The remembrance of the <b>exodus from Egypt, the splitting of the Red Sea, the giving of the Torah, the resurrection of the dead, and the pangs of the Messiah. </b> Since it mentions these key concepts, this hallel is also considered important. |
| Psalms 136:25 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits in the heights of the universe and dispenses food to every creature. | Pesachim 118a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And why is</b> this section <b>called the great <i>hallel</i>? R' Yoḥanan said: Because</b> this passage states that <b>God sits in the heights of the universe and dispenses food to every creature. </b> The whole world praises God for His kindness through the great <i>hallel</i>, which includes the verse: “Who gives food to all flesh” (Psalms 136:25). |
| Psalms 137:1 | which is written: “By the rivers of Babylonia, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion” | Gittin 57b:11 | <b>And this is</b> what <b>R' Elazar says: </b> The verse that says: <b>“You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue”</b> (Job 5:21), means: <b>You shall</b> need to <b>hide on account of quarrels</b> provoked <b>by the tongue.

| Psalms 137:7 | remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom | Rosh Hashanah32b:3 | The Talmud qualifies the Mishnah’s ruling. <b>However, if one comes to recite</b> verses of <b>Kingship, remembrance, and <i>shofar</i></b> with a theme <b>of the punishment of non-Jews, one may recite</b> them. The Talmud offers examples of these verses: With regard to the verses of <b>Kingship, for example: “YHWH reigns, let the peoples tremble”</b> (Psalms 99:1), <b>and, for example: “YHWH is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land”</b> (Psalms 10:16). With regard to <b>remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom</b> the day of Jerusalem, who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). With regard to the verses of <b><i>shofar</i>, for example: “And YHWH God will sound the</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>and will go with whirlwinds of the south”</b> (Zechariah 9:14), <b>and it is written: “YHWH of hosts will defend them”</b> (Zechariah 9:15), i.e., God will defend the Jewish people against their enemies. |
| Psalms 138:4 | which is written: “All the kings of the earth shall give You thanks, O Lord, for they have heard the words of Your mouth” | Kiddushin 31a:6 | § <b>Ulla the Great interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “All the kings of the earth shall give You thanks, O Lord, for they have heard the words of Your mouth”</b> (Psalms 138:4)? It <b>is not stated: The word of Your mouth, </b> in the singular. <b>Rather, </b> the verse uses the expression: <b>“The words of Your mouth, ”</b> in the plural. To what is this phrase referring? <b>When God said: “I am</b> YHWH your God” (Exodus 20:2), <b>and, </b> in the same verse: <b>“You shall have no</b> other gods before Me,” <b>the nations of the world said: He teaches</b> this <b>for His own honor, </b> as both statements entail respect for God. |
| Psalms 138:6 | and from the haughty He is pained from afar” | Sotah 5a:12 | <b>And R' Elazar says: </b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, the Shekhina wails over him.

| Psalms 138:6 | the lowly, as it is stated: “For though the Lord is high, yet regards He the lowly” | Sotah 5a:13 | <b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> that <b>R' Elazar</b> interpreted as follows: <b>Come and see that the attribute of God is not like the attribute of flesh and blood.

He is elevated but sees</b> specifically <b>the lowly, as it is stated: “For though YHWH is high, yet regards He the lowly”</b> (Psalms 138:6). |
| Psalms 139:3 | which is written: “You measure [ zerita ] my going about [ orḥi ] and my lying down [ riv’i ], and are acquainted with all my ways” | Niddah 31a:18 | <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You measure [<i>zerita</i>] my going about [<i>orḥi</i>] and my lying down [<i>riv’i</i>], and are acquainted with all my ways”</b> (Psalms 139:3)? This verse <b>teaches that a person is not created from the entire drop</b> of semen, <b>but from its clear</b> part. <i>Zerita</i> can mean to winnow, while <i>orḥi</i> and <i>riv’i</i> can both be explained as references to sex. Therefore the verse is interpreted homiletically as saying that God separates the procreative part of the semen from the rest. <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught a parable: </b> This matter is comparable <b>to a person who winnows</b> grain <b>in the granary; he takes the food and leaves the waste. </b> |
| Psalms 139:5 | “You have hemmed me in behind and before” | Avodah Zarah6a:10 | <b>Ravina says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the Mishnah (8a). <b>And these are the festivals of non-Jews: Kalenda, Saturnalia, and Kratesis.

And your mnemonic</b> to remember which festival is which is that the festival that occurs after the solstice is mentioned first and the festival that takes place before it is mentioned later, as in the verse: <b>“You have hemmed me in behind and before”</b> (Psalms 139:5), where the word “before” appears after the term “behind. ” |
| Psalms 139:5 | “You have hemmed me in behind and before, | Avodah Zarah8a:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says: </b> When are these festivals celebrated? <b>Kalenda</b> is celebrated during the <b>eight days after</b> the winter <b>solstice, </b> and <b>Saturnalia</b> is celebrated during the <b>eight days before</b> the winter <b>solstice.

| Psalms 139:5 | as it is stated: “You have formed me [ tzartani ] behind and before” | Berakhot 61a:5 | <b>Alternatively, </b> this duplication in the language of creation can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>R' Yirmeya ben Elazar, as R' Yirmeya ben Elazar said: God created two faces [<i>du partzufin</i>] on Adam the first</b> man; he was created both male and female in a single body, <b>as it is stated: “You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before”</b> (Psalms 139:5); <i>tzartani</i> is derived from the word <i>tzura</i> [face]. God formed two faces on a single creation, back and front. |
| Psalms 139:5 | When he sinned, the Holy One, Blessed be He, placed His hand upon him and diminished him, as it is stated: “You fashioned me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me” | Chagigah 12a:2 | The Talmud answers that this phrase teaches us something else, <b>according to R' Elazar. </b> As <b>R' Elazar said: </b> The height of <b>Adam the first man</b> reached <b>from the ground to the skies, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, </b> and from one end of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:32). <b>When he sinned, God placed His hand upon him and diminished him, as it is stated: “You fashioned me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me”</b> (Psalms 139:5). |
| Psalms 139:5 | As it is stated: “You have formed me behind and before, | Eruvin 18a:15 | <b>R' Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Adam</b> was first created with <b>two [<i>deyo</i>] faces, </b> one male and the other female. <b>As it is stated: “You have formed me behind and before, </b> and laid Your hand upon me” (Psalms 139:5). Similarly, <b>it is written: “And the <i>tzela</i>, which</b> YHWH, God, had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree over the meaning of the word <i>tzela</i>: <b>One said: </b> It means a female <b>face, </b> from which God created Eve; <b>and one said: </b> Adam was created with <b>a tail [<i>zanav</i>], </b> which God removed from him and from which He created Eve. |
| Psalms 139:5 | sinned, the Holy One, Blessed be He, placed His hand on him and diminished him, as it is stated: “Behind and before You have created me and laid Your hand upon me” | Sanhedrin 38b:7 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Adam the first</b> man spanned <b>from one end of the world until the other, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:32), meaning that on the day Adam was created he spanned from one end of the heavens until the other. <b>Once</b> Adam <b>sinned, God placed His hand on him and diminished him, as it is stated: “Behind and before You have created me and laid Your hand upon me”</b> (Psalms 139:5), that at first Adam spanned “behind and before,” meaning everywhere, and then God laid His hand on him and diminished him. |
| Psalms 139:11 | raises an objection: “And I say, yet the darkness shall envelop me, and the or about me shall be night” | Pesachim 2b:3 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection: “And I say, yet the darkness shall envelop me, and the <i>or</i> about me shall be night”</b> (Psalms 139:11). <b>Apparently, <i>or</i> is day. </b> The Talmud rejects this proof. <b>This is</b> what <b>David is saying there: I said</b> after I sinned that <b>darkness shall envelop me in the World-to-Come, which is like day. Now</b> that I know that I have been forgiven, even <b>this world, which is like darkness, </b> is <b>light for me. </b> That being the case, it cannot be derived from here that the word <i>or</i> describes the day. |
| Psalms 139:14 | which is written: “I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and that my soul knows very well” | Niddah 31a:13 | <b>R' Yosei HaGelili taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and that my soul knows very well”</b> (Psalms 139:14)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of God. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person plants seeds</b> of different species <b>in</b> one <b>garden bed, each and every one</b> of the seeds <b>emerges</b> as a grown plant <b>according to its species. But God forms the fetus in a woman’s womb, and all of</b> the seeds, i.e., those of both the father and the mother, <b>emerge</b> when the offspring is formed <b>as one</b> sex. |
| Psalms 139:15 | “When I was made in secret, and I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth” | Niddah 31a:5 | <b>And R' Elazar says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus initially resides in the lower part of the womb? <b>“When I was made in secret, and I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth”</b> (Psalms 139:15). Since it <b>is not stated: I resided</b> in the lowest parts of the earth, <b>but rather: “I was woven together</b> in the lowest parts of the earth,” this teaches that during the initial stage of a fetus’s development, when it is woven together, its location is in the lower compartment of the womb. |
| Psalms 139:17 | said: “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God! | Avodah Zarah5a:9 | The Talmud raises a further difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Reish Lakish say: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam, </b> in the day that God created man” (Genesis 5:1)? <b>Did Adam the first</b> man <b>have a book? </b> Rather, the verse <b>teaches that God showed Adam, the first</b> man, <b>every generation and its expositors, every generation and its rabbis, </b> and <b>every generation and its leaders. When</b> Adam <b>arrived at the generation of R' Akiva, he rejoiced in his Torah and was saddened by his death, </b> as R' Akiva was tortured and murdered. Adam <b>said: “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God!</b> How great is the sum of them” (Psalms 139:17). It is evident from here that the Jews were destined to bear future generations from the beginning of time. |
| Psalms 139:17 | “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God” | Sanhedrin 38b:9 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Adam the first</b> man <b>spoke in the language of Aramaic, as it is stated</b> in the chapter of Psalms speaking in the voice of Adam: <b>“How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God”</b> (Psalms 139:17). |
| Psalms 140:9 | which is written: “Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they not exalt themselves. Selah” | Megillah 6a:19 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they not exalt themselves. Selah”</b> (Psalms 140:9)? <b>Jacob said before God: God!, grant not to the wicked Esau the desires of his heart, </b> as he wishes to destroy us. <b>Further not his evil device [<i>zemamo</i>]; </b> do not remove the muzzle [<i>zamam</i>] that constrains him and prevents him from breaking out and gathering further strength. <b>This is</b> a reference to |
| Psalms 140:14 | wait one hour after his prayer, as it is stated: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You” | Berakhot 32b:22 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who prays must</b> also <b>wait one hour after his prayer, as it is stated: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You”</b> (Psalms 140:14), meaning that after thanking God through prayer, one should stay and sit before Him. |
| Psalms 141:2 | with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering” | Berakhot 6b:28 | <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> said: One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the evening prayer as well, as it is stated: “Let my prayer come forth as incense before You, the lifting of my hands as the evening offering”</b> (Psalms 141:2). <b><b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> One must be vigilant <b>with regard to the morning prayer as well, as it is stated: “Lord, in the morning You shall hear my voice; in the morning I will order my prayer unto You and will look forward”</b> (Psalms 5:4). |
| Psalms 142:3 | and afterward request his own needs, as it is stated: “I pour out siḥi before Him, I declare before Him my trouble” | Avodah Zarah7b:15 | <b>R' Yehoshua says: </b> One <b>should pray</b> first <b>and afterward request his own needs, as it is stated: “I pour out <i>siḥi</i> before Him, I declare before Him my trouble”</b> (Psalms 142:3), which teaches that first one pours forth his <i>siḥa</i>, and only afterward speaks of his own troubles. |
| Psalms 144:8 | as it is stated: “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying” | Bava Batra45a:6 | <b>Ameimar said: Even if there are not any of these</b> factors, the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him. <b>What is the reasoning</b> for this? It is that <b>it is known that an ordinary non-Jew is an extortionist, </b> so it is assumed that the donkey did indeed belong to the seller, <b>as it is stated: “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8). |
| Psalms 144:8 | “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying” | Niddah 45a:15 | The Talmud answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Yusteni was able to become pregnant at such a young age because she was a non-Jew, and the verse states with regard to non-Jews: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Yusteni was lying when she said she became pregnant at age seven, as it is stated with regard to non-Jews: <b>“Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8). |
| Psalms 144:12 | one hundred cubits, corresponding to the Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of the Sanctuary” | Bava Batra75a:13 | <b>R' Yehuda says: </b> They will have the stature of <b>one hundred cubits, corresponding to the Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of the Sanctuary”</b> (Psalms 144:12). But if they are each one hundred cubits tall, how could the Jews enter the gates of Jerusalem, whose entrance gate will be ten by twenty cubits, as claimed by R' Yoḥanan? The Talmud answers: <b>When R' Yoḥanan stated</b> that idea, he was not referring to the gates themselves but <b>to</b> the <b>windows that</b> allow <b>wind</b> to enter. |
| Psalms 144:12 | that which is written: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner pillars carved after the fashion of a palace” | Pesachim 87a:9 | <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> a homiletic interpretation of another verse in praise of Israel: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner pillars carved after the fashion of a palace”</b> (Psalms 144:12)? |
| Psalms 144:12 | Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “For our sons are as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as cornerstones, carved in the fashion of a palace” | Sanhedrin 100a:9 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the statement of R' Yoḥanan that the gates will be twenty cubits high. The rabbis engaged in a dispute concerning the interpretation of the verse: <b>“And I made you go upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13). <b>R' Meir says</b> that in the end of days people will be <b>two hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>the equivalent of twice the height of Adam the first</b> man, who was one hundred cubits tall. <b>R' Yehuda says: </b> People will be <b>one hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>corresponding to</b> the height of the <b>Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “For our sons are as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as cornerstones, carved in the fashion of a palace”</b> (Psalms 144:12), indicating that the sons and daughters will be one hundred cubits tall, the height of the Sanctuary. If the people are that tall, how will they enter gates twenty cubits high? |
| Psalms 144:13 | from here: “Our corners are full, affording all manner of store” | Pesachim 87a:10 | The Talmud interprets each phrase of this verse: <b>“We whose sons are as plants”</b> indicates they are healthy and undamaged; <b>these are the young men of Israel who have not tasted the taste of sin. “Whose daughters are as corner pillars”</b> indicates that they are filled and sealed; <b>these are the virgins of Israel, who bind</b> and seal <b>their openings</b> exclusively <b>for their husbands. And similarly, </b> another verse demonstrates that a corner refers to something full: <b>It is stated: “And they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar”</b> (Zechariah 9:15). <b>If you wish, say</b> an alternative support for this idea <b>from here: “Our corners are full, affording all manner of store”</b> (Psalms 144:13). |
| Psalms 144:14 | “Our leaders are laden, | Berakhot 17a:16 | <b>When the rabbis took leave of the study hall of Rav Ḥisda, and some say</b> it was <b>the study hall of R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani, they would say to him the following, </b> in accordance with the verse: <b>“Our leaders are laden, </b> there is no breach and no going forth and no outcry in our open places” (Psalms 144:14). |
| Psalms 145:9 | “And His tender mercies are over all His works” | Avodah Zarah4b:9 | Upon awakening, R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said: </b> I can <b>conclude from</b> the fact that I fell asleep that it is <b>not proper conduct to do this, </b> to curse people, even if they are wicked, as the verse: <b>“And His tender mercies are over all His works”</b> (Psalms 145:9) <b>is written</b> even with regard to sinners. <b>And</b> moreover, it is inappropriate to cause the punishment of another, as <b>it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good”</b> (Proverbs 17:26). Even for a righteous person, it is improper to punish another. |
| Psalms 145:9 | and His mercies are over all His works” | Bava Metzia85a:7 | The Talmud explains the statement: <b>And left</b> him <b>due to</b> another <b>incident. One day, the female slave of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was sweeping</b> his <b>house. There were young weasels [<i>karkushta</i>] lying</b> about, <b>and she was</b> in the process of <b>sweeping them</b> out. R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to her: Let them be, </b> as <b>it is written: </b> “YHWH is good to all; <b>and His mercies are over all His works”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>They said</b> in Heaven: <b>Since he was compassionate, we shall be compassionate on him, </b> and he was relieved of his suffering. |
| Psalms 145:9 | “His mercy is over all His creations” | Berakhot 7a:19 | The Talmud relates: <b>A certain heretic who was in R' Yehoshua ben Levi’s neighborhood would upset him</b> by incessantly challenging the legitimacy of <b>verses. One day, </b> R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>took a rooster and placed it between the legs of the bed</b> upon which he sat <b>and looked at it. He thought: When the moment</b> of God’s anger <b>arrives, I will curse him</b> and be rid of him. <b>When the moment</b> of God’s anger <b>arrived, </b> R' Yehoshua ben Levi <b>slept. </b> When he woke up, <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>Conclude from</b> the fact that I nodded off <b>that it is not proper conduct to do so, </b> to curse people, even if they are wicked. <b>“His mercy is over all His creations”</b> (Psalms 145:9) <b>is written</b> even with regard to sinners. |
| Psalms 145:9 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord is good to all” | Menachot 53b:3 | R' Ezra stated another, similar homily: <b>Let the good one come and receive the good from the Good for the good ones. </b> He explained: <b>Let the good one come; this</b> good <b>is Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“And when she saw him that he was a goodly child”</b> (Exodus 2:2). <b>And receive the good; this</b> good <b>is</b> the <b>Torah, as it is written</b> about the Torah: <b>“For I give you a good doctrine; </b> do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2). <b>From the Good; this is</b> referring to <b>God as it is written: “YHWH is good to all”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>For the good ones; these</b> good ones <b>are the Jews, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“Do good, Lord, to the good ones”</b> (Psalms 125:4). |
| Psalms 145:9 | “The Lord is good to all | Sanhedrin 39b:2 | The Talmud cites a related statement: <b>R' Elazar raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“YHWH is good to all</b> and His compassion is over all His works” (Psalms 145:9), <b>and it is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“YHWH is good to those who wait for Him, </b> to the soul that seeks Him” (Lamentations 3:25). He explains: This can be <b>compared to a person who has an orchard. When he waters</b> it, <b>he waters all of it. </b> Perforce, the water reaches all parts of the orchard, and he cannot discriminate between trees. This is the meaning of the verse: “YHWH is good to all. ” By contrast, <b>when he hoes</b> around the trees, <b>he hoes only</b> around <b>the good</b> trees <b>among them. </b> Similarly, when God bestows goodness to the world, all receive it. When He protects people from harm, not all are protected. |
| Psalms 145:14 | “The Lord upholds the fallen | Berakhot 4b:22 | In order to ease the harsh meaning of this verse, <b>in the West, </b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they interpreted it</b> with a slight adjustment: <b>“She has fallen but she shall fall no more; rise, virgin of Israel. ” Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> adds: <b>Even so, David went and</b> provided <b>support, through Holy Spirit. </b> Although King David did not include a verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i> alluding to Israel’s downfall, he foresaw the verse that would be written by Amos through Holy Spirit; and the very next verse, which begins with the letter <i>samekh</i>, reads: <b>“YHWH upholds the fallen</b> and raises up those who are bowed down” (Psalms 145:14). Therefore, through Holy Spirit, David offered hope and encouragement; although the virgin of Israel may have fallen, YHWH upholds the fallen. |
| Psalms 145:15 | “the eyes of all wait for You, and You give them their food in its time” | Ketubot 67b:6 | The Talmud relates another story. <b>A certain person came before Rava</b> to request charity. <b>He said to him: On what do you</b> normally <b>dine? He said to him: On a fattened hen and aged wine. He said to him: And were you not concerned for</b> causing <b>a burden to the community</b> by expecting such opulent foods? <b>He said to him: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>from their</b> funds that <b>I eat? I eat from</b> the support of <b>God. </b> This would seem to be a reasonable argument, <b>as we</b> already <b>learned</b> that in the verse <b>“the eyes of all wait for You, and You give them their food in its time”</b> (Psalms 145:15), the phrase: <b>At their time, is</b> not <b>stated, rather “in its time. ”</b> This <b>teaches that God gives each and every one his</b> personally appropriate <b>sustenance at its proper time, </b> and the community is merely His agent in discharging His will. Therefore, the man is justified in maintaining his standard. |
| Psalms 145:16 | “You open Your hand | Berakhot 4b:19 | <b>Rather, </b> if you suggest that this particular chapter is recited <b>because it contains</b> praise for God’s provision of sustenance to all of creation: <b>“You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16), then <b>let him recite the great <i>hallel</i></b> (Psalms 136), <b>in which</b> numerous praises are <b>written, </b> including: <b>“Who provides food to all flesh, </b> Whose kindness endures forever” (Psalms 136:25). |
| Psalms 145:16 | as it is written: “You open Your hand | Taanit 2b:2 | <b>In the West, </b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: The key of livelihood</b> is <b>also</b> in God’s hand, <b>as it is written: “You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16). The Talmud asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan did not consider this</b> key of livelihood in his list? The Talmud answers that R' Yoḥanan could have <b>said to you: Rain is</b> the same as <b>livelihood</b> in this regard, as rain is indispensable to all livelihoods. |
| Psalms 145:16 | as it is written: “You open Your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor” | Taanit 8b:7 | § The Talmud relates: <b>In the days of R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani there was a famine and a plague. </b> The rabbis <b>said: What</b> should we <b>do? Should we pray for mercy for two</b> troubles, both the famine and the plague? This is <b>not possible, </b> as it is improper to pray for the alleviation of two afflictions at once. <b>Rather, let us pray for mercy for the plague, and</b> as for the <b>famine, we</b> must <b>bear</b> it. <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said to them: </b> On the contrary, <b>let us pray for mercy for the famine, as when God provides plenty, He gives it for</b> the sake of <b>the living, </b> i.e., if God answers this prayer then he will certainly bring an end to the plague as well, <b>as it is written: “You open Your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor”</b> (Psalms 145:16). |
| Psalms 145:17 | It is written: “The Lord is righteous [ tzaddik ] in all His ways” | Rosh Hashanah17b:2 | § <b>Rav Huna raised a contradiction</b> between the two halves of a verse. <b>It is written: “YHWH is righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>] in all His ways”</b> (Psalms 145:17), indicating that God acts in accordance with the attribute of strict justice [<i>tzedek</i>], <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And kind [<i>ḥasid</i>] in all His works, ”</b> implying that He acts with grace and loving-kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>], going beyond the letter of the law. Rav Huna explained: <b>Initially, </b> at the time of judgment, <b>He is righteous, but in the end, </b> at the time of punishment, <b>He is gracious. </b> |
| Psalms 145:21 | “My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever” | Pesachim 117a:22 | <b>Rav Ḥanin bar Rava said: Everyone concedes</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“My mouth shall speak the praise of YHWH; and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever”</b> (Psalms 145:21), that the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows, </b> the opening word of the subsequent psalm, marks <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter, </b> not the conclusion of the previous one. Likewise, with regard to the verse: <b>“The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish”</b> (Psalms 112:10), the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows it, </b> is <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter. And</b> similarly, with regard to: <b>“You who stand in the house of YHWH”</b> (Psalms 135:2) the <b><i>halleluya</i> that follows it, </b> in verse 3, signifies <b>the start of</b> the next <b>chapter. </b> |
| Psalms 146:7 | “God releases prisoners” | Yoma 35b:12 | One day <b>she said to him: Submit to me</b> and have sex with me. <b><b>He said to her: No. </b> <b><b>She said to him: I will incarcerate you in the prison.

| Psalms 146:8 | As it is written: “The Lord, who raises the bowed” | Berakhot 12a:25 | <b>Shmuel, </b> who was Rav’s colleague and significantly outlived him, <b>said: What is Rav’s reason</b> for saying that one should stand upright at the mention of God’s name? <b>As it is written: “YHWH, who raises the bowed”</b> (Psalms 146:8); one stands upright at the mention of God’s name to recall that it is God who raises the bowed. |
| Psalms 146:8 | “God straightens those who are bent over” | Yoma 35b:12 | One day <b>she said to him: Submit to me</b> and have sex with me. <b><b>He said to her: No. </b> <b><b>She said to him: I will incarcerate you in the prison.

| Psalms 147:2 | he opened with: Have compassion on Jerusalem, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem. Rav Naḥman said: Even if he opened with: Have compassion on Israel, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem, because it is stated: “The Lord builds Jerusalem; He gathers in the exiles of Israel” | Berakhot 49a:14 | <b>Rav Sheshet said: </b> If <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Your people, Israel, </b> mentioning redemption of Israel at the start, <b>he concludes with: Who redeems Israel; </b> if <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Jerusalem, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem. Rav Naḥman said: Even if he opened with: Have compassion on Israel, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem, because it is stated: “YHWH builds Jerusalem; He gathers in the exiles of Israel”</b> (Psalms 147:2). This verse is interpreted to mean: <b>When does God build Jerusalem? When He gathers in the exiles of Israel. </b> The rebuilding of Jerusalem symbolizes Israel’s redemption. |
| Psalms 147:2 | “The Lord builds up Jerusalem, | Menachot 87a:19 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: </b> They recite the verse: <b>“YHWH builds up Jerusalem, </b> He gathers together the dispersed of Israel” (Psalms 147:2). The Talmud asks: <b>And initially, </b> when the Temple still stood and the Jewish people were gathered together in Eretz Yisrael, <b>what would</b> the watchmen <b>say? Rava bar Rav Sheila says: </b> They would say: <b>“For YHWH has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation. </b> This is My resting place forever; here will I dwell for I have desired it” (Psalms 132:13–14). |
| Psalms 147:4 | “He counts the number of the stars; | Sanhedrin 39a:5 | <b>The emperor said to Rabban Gamliel: It is written</b> in praise of YHWH: <b>“He counts the number of the stars; </b> He gives them all their names” (Psalms 147:4). <b>What is His greatness?

Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: </b> The <b>firmament also revolves like this, </b> therefore you cannot count the stars in it. |
| Psalms 147:5 | “Great is our Lord, and mighty in power” | Avodah Zarah4a:4 | § <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa raises a contradiction</b> between the following verses. <b>It is written: “God, Whom we have not found out His excellent power”</b> (Job 37:23), which indicates that His power has not been seen. <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Great is our Lord, and mighty in power”</b> (Psalms 147:5), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power”</b> (Exodus 15:6), from which it may be inferred that His power is discernable. The Talmud answers: This is <b>not difficult; here, </b> in the first verse, God’s strength is not seen <b>at a time of judgment, </b> where He acts mercifully, whereas <b>there, </b> in the other verses, they are referring <b>to a time of war, </b> when He wages war against His enemies and His power is seen. |
| Psalms 147:9 | to the young ravens that cry” | Ketubot 49b:5 | <b>When they would come before Rav Ḥisda</b> to register a similar complaint, <b>he</b> would <b>say to them: Turn over a mortar for him in public, </b> as a raised platform, <b>and let</b> that father <b>stand up and say</b> about himself: <b>The raven wants</b> to care for <b>its sons, and</b> yet <b>this man does not want</b> to support <b>his sons. </b> The Talmud questions this statement: <b>And</b> does <b>the raven want</b> to feed <b>its sons? But isn’t it written: </b> “He gives to the beast its food, <b>to the young ravens that cry”</b> (Psalms 147:9)? This verse indicates that the parents of young ravens do not feed them. The Talmud responds: This is <b>not difficult, </b> as in <b>this</b> case it is referring <b>to white ones, </b> and in <b>that</b> case it is referring <b>to black ones. </b> There are different types of ravens, some of which feed their young while others do not. |
| Psalms 147:14 | grain inside his house, as discord is found in a person’s house only over matters of grain, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you plenty with the finest wheat” | Bava Metzia59a:9 | Apropos the topic of how a man should approach his household, <b>Rav Yehuda says: A person must always be careful about</b> ensuring that there is <b>grain inside his house, as discord is found in a person’s house only over matters of grain, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you plenty with the finest wheat”</b> (Psalms 147:14). If there is the finest wheat in your house, there will be peace there. <b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: When the barley is emptied from the jug, quarrel knocks and enters the house. </b> |
| Psalms 147:14 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat” | Berakhot 57a:5 | <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One who sees wheat in a dream has seen peace, as it is stated: “He makes your borders peace; He gives you in plenty the fat of wheat”</b> (Psalms 147:14). And <b>one who sees barley [<i>se’orim</i>] in a dream</b> has received a sign that <b>his iniquities are taken away, as it is stated: “And your iniquity is taken away [<i>vesar avonekh</i>], and your sin expiated”</b> (Isaiah 6:7); <i>se’orim</i> is an acronym for <i>sar avon</i>. <b>R' Zeira said: I did not ascend from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael until I saw barley in my dream. </b> |
| Psalms 147:20 | The words of Torah may not be transmitted to a gentile, as it is stated: “He has not dealt so with any nation, and as for His ordinances, they have not known them” | Chagigah 13a:6 | <b>R' Ami said: The secrets of the Torah may be transmitted only to one who possesses</b> the following <b>five characteristics: “The captain of fifty, and the man of favor, and the counselor, and the cunning charmer, and the skillful enchanter”</b> (Isaiah 3:3). <b>And R' Ami said</b> further: <b>The words of Torah may not be transmitted to a non-Jew, as it is stated: “He has not dealt so with any nation, and as for His ordinances, they have not known them”</b> (Psalms 147:20). |
| Psalms 148:3 | praise Him, all the stars of or ” | Pesachim 2a:7 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection: </b> “Praise Him, sun and moon; <b>praise Him, all the stars of <i>or</i>”</b> (Psalms 148:3). <b>Apparently, <i>or</i> is</b> the <b>evening, </b> as the stars of light appear at night. The Talmud rejects this contention. <b>This is</b> what the verse <b>is saying: Praise Him, all the stars that radiate, </b> as in this context <i>or</i> is not a noun but rather a verb that describes the activity of the stars. The Talmud challenges this explanation: <b>However, if</b> that <b>is so, </b> does the verse mean that <b>it is</b> the <b>stars that radiate that are required to praise</b> God, whereas those <b>that do not radiate</b> light <b>are not required to praise</b> Him? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the previous verse: <b>“Praise Him, all His legions, ”</b> indicating that all stars should praise God? |
| Psalms 148:8 | upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word” | Chagigah 12b:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says: Woe to them, the creations, who see and know not what they see; </b> who <b>stand and know not upon what they stand. </b> He clarifies: <b>Upon what does the earth stand? Upon pillars, as it is stated: “Who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble”</b> (Job 9:6). These <b>pillars</b> are positioned <b>upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters”</b> (Psalms 136:6). These <b>waters</b> stand <b>upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains”</b> (Psalms 104:6). The <b>mountains</b> are upon the <b>wind, as it is stated: “For behold He forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). The <b>wind</b> is <b>upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word”</b> (Psalms 148:8). The <b>storm hangs upon the arm of God as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), which demonstrates that the entire world rests upon the arms of God. |
| Psalms 148:10 | “The undomesticated animal and all domesticated animals, creeping things and winged birds [ tzippor ]” | Chullin 139b:18 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage describing how all of creation praises God: <b>“The undomesticated animal and all domesticated animals, creeping things and winged birds [<i>tzippor</i>]”</b> (Psalms 148:10). <b>What, is it not</b> that the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> is referring to all birds, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher, and</b> the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>grasshoppers? </b> The Talmud rejects this: <b>No, </b> the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> means <b>a kosher</b> bird, while the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>non-kosher</b> birds <b>and</b> to <b>grasshoppers. </b> |
| Psalms 149:6 | as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands” | Berakhot 5a:4 | The Talmud continues its treatment of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> upon one’s bed. <b>R' Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> on his bed, it is as if he holds a double-edged sword, </b> guarding him from all evil, <b>as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands”</b> (Psalms 149:6). The Talmud asks: <b>From where is it inferred</b> that this verse from Psalms refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>? <b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: </b> We derive it <b>from the preceding</b> verse, <b>as it is written: “Let the pious exult in glory; let them joyously sing upon their beds. ”</b> The praise of God from one’s bed is the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>And it is written thereafter: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands. ”</b> |
| Psalms 149:8 | “To bind [ le’esor ] their kings with chains” | Avodah Zarah16b:13 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>one may not build</b> a basilica in conjunction with non-Jews. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: There are three</b> types of <b>basilicas: </b> Those <b>of kings, and</b> those <b>of bathhouses, and</b> those <b>of storehouses. Rava says: Two</b> of these types <b>are permitted, </b> as they are not used for inflicting the death penalty, <b>and one is prohibited [<i>le’isor</i>]. And a mnemonic</b> device for this ruling, that the basilica of kings is prohibited, is the verse: <b>“To bind [<i>le’esor</i>] their kings with chains”</b> (Psalms 149:8). |
| Psalms 150:3 | which it is written by them: “Praise Him with the blast of the shofar ” | Rosh Hashanah32a:17 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>These ten</b> verses of <b>Kingship, to what do they correspond? R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: </b> They <b>correspond to the ten praises that David said in the book of Psalms. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>There are many</b> more <b>praises</b> than that in the book of Psalms. The Talmud answers that he means <b>those</b> in <b>which it is written by them: “Praise Him with the blast of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Psalms 150:3). In that chapter the phrase “Praise Him” appears ten times. |
| Psalms 150:6 | praise the Lord; Halleluya” | Berakhot 25a:3 | <b>It was stated</b> that the rabbis disagreed with regard to one who had <b>fecal matter on his skin or</b> whose <b>hand, </b> but not the rest of his body, <b>was placed inside the bathroom. </b> Under those circumstances, <b>Rav Huna said: </b> He is <b>permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>. Rav Ḥisda said: He is prohibited from reciting <i>Shema</i>. Rava said: What is the reason for Rav Huna’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “Let every soul</b> [<b><i>neshama</i></b>] <b>praise YHWH; Halleluya”</b> (Psalms 150:6), which he interprets as “Let everything that has breath” [<i>neshima</i>]. As long as the mouth with which one recites praise is in a place of purity, the location of the other limbs of his body is irrelevant. |
| Psalms 150:6 | that one recites a blessing over scent? As it is stated: “Let every soul praise the Lord” | Berakhot 43b:3 | On a related topic, the Talmud cites that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who goes out during Nisan and sees trees that are blossoming recites: Blessed…who has withheld nothing from His world, and has created in it beautiful creatures and trees for human beings to enjoy. Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one recites a blessing over scent? As it is stated: “Let every soul praise YHWH”</b> (Psalms 150:6). He explains the verse: <b>What is it from which the soul derives benefit and the body does not derive benefit from it? You must say: That is scent. </b> Even over items from which only the soul derives benefit, one must recite a blessing and praise God. |
| Psalms 150:6 | as it is stated: “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord [ Yah ]. Halleluya ” | Eruvin 18b:17 | <b>And R' Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> further <b>said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, it is enough for the world to use</b> in its praise of God, or in greeting one another with the name of God, only <b>two letters</b> of the Tetragrammaton, namely <i>yod</i> and <i>heh</i>, <b>as it is stated: “Let everything that has breath praise YHWH [<i>Yah</i>]. <i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 150:6), without mentioning the full name of God, comprised of four letters. |
