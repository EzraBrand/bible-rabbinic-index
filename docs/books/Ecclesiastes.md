| Ecclesiastes 1:1 | And ultimately, he ruled over only Jerusalem, as it is stated: “The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem” | Sanhedrin 20b:17 | Reish Lakish continues: <b>And ultimately,</b> Solomon declined further still in that <b>he ruled only over Israel, as it is stated: “I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel</b> in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only Jerusalem, as it is stated: “The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:1). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only his bed, as it is stated: “Behold, it is the bed of Solomon;</b> threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Ecclesiastes 1:2 | “Vanity of vanities, says Kohelet; vanity of vanities, all is vanity” | Bava Batra100b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On their return from the burial, the mourners would stop after traveling a short distance and would sit to bewail the loss of the deceased. They would then stand and continue journeying for a short while and then repeat the procedure. The mourners perform <b>no fewer than seven standings and sittings</b> in honor <b>of the deceased.</b> These seven <b>correspond</b> to the seven references to “vanity” in the verse: <b>“Vanity of vanities, says Kohelet; vanity of vanities, all is vanity”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:2), counting the plural term “vanities” as two references. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:3 | four hundred parasangs. With regard to that moment Solomon said: “What profit is there for a person through all of his toil under the sun?” | Gittin 68b:15 | Ashmedai <b>said to him: Take the chain</b> engraved with God’s name <b>off me and give me your ring</b> with God’s name engraved on it, <b>and I will show you my strength.</b> Solomon <b>took the chain off him and he gave him his ring.</b> Ashmedai <b>swallowed</b> the ring and grew until <b>he placed one wing in the heaven and one wing on the earth. He threw</b> Solomon a distance of <b>four hundred parasangs. With regard to that moment Solomon said: “What profit is there for a person through all of his toil under the sun?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:3). With Solomon deposed from the throne, Ashmedai took his place. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:3 | matters of Torah, as it is written: “What profit has man of all his labor which he labors under the sun?” | Shabbat 30b:3 | Since contradictions in Ecclesiastes were mentioned, the Gemara cites additional relevant sources. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Ecclesiastes</b> and declare it apocryphal <b>because its statements contradict each other</b> and it is liable to confuse its readers. <b>And why did they not suppress it? Because its beginning</b> consists of <b>matters of Torah and its end</b> consists of <b>matters of Torah.</b> The ostensibly contradictory details are secondary to the essence of the book, which is Torah. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Its beginning</b> consists of <b>matters of Torah, as it is written: “What profit has man of all his labor which he labors under the sun?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:3), <b>and</b> the Sages of <b>the school</b> of <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> By inference: <b>Under the sun is where</b> man <b>has no</b> profit from his labor; however, <b>before the sun,</b> i.e., when engaged in the study of Torah, which preceded the sun, <b>he does have</b> profit. <b>Its ending</b> consists of <b>matters of Torah, as it is written: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God, and keep His mitzvot; for this is the whole man” (</b>Ecclesiastes 12:13). With regard to this verse, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>For this is the whole man? Rabbi Eliezer said: The entire world was only created for this</b> person. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: This</b> person <b>is equivalent to the entire world. Shimon ben Azzai says and some say</b> that <b>Shimon ben Zoma says: The entire world was only created as companion to this</b> man, so that he will not be alone. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:4 | said to him: And isn’t it written: “One generation passes away, and another generation comes” | Chagigah 5a:2 | <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said to</b> the Angel of Death: Do <b>you have the right to act in this</b> manner, to take someone before his time? The Angel of Death <b>said to him: And</b> is it <b>not written: “But there are those swept away without justice”</b> (Proverbs 13:23)? Rav Beivai <b>said to him: And isn’t it written: “One generation passes away, and another generation comes”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:4), which indicates that there is a predetermined amount of time for the life of every generation. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:5 | teaches you that a righteous person does not leave the world before an equally righteous person is created, as it is stated: “The sun also rises and the sun also sets” | Kiddushin 72b:2 | The Gemara comments: <b>As the Master said: While Rabbi Akiva was dying, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was born; while Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was dying, Rav Yehuda was born; while Rav Yehuda was dying, Rava was born; while Rava was dying, Rav Ashi was born.</b> This <b>teaches you that a righteous person does not leave the world before an equally righteous person is created, as it is stated: “The sun also rises and the sun also sets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:5). The same applies to earlier generations: <b>Before Eli’s sun had gone out, Samuel the Ramathite’s sun was</b> already <b>rising, as it is stated: “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying</b> in the Temple of the Lord” (I Samuel 3:3), which teaches that Samuel was already prophesying in the days of Eli. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:5 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: No righteous person departs from this world until another comparable righteous person is created, as it is stated: “And the sun rises and the sun sets” | Yoma 38b:13 | Apropos the righteous, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: No righteous person departs from this world until another comparable righteous person is created, as it is stated: “And the sun rises and the sun sets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:5); before the sun sets the new sun has already risen. <b>Before the sun of Eli was extinguished, the sun of Samuel of Ramah</b> had already <b>shone</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 3), and so on throughout the generations. And <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, saw that righteous people were few,</b> so <b>He arose and planted</b> some of <b>them in each and every generation</b> to ensure the presence of at least one righteous person in each generation. <b>As it is stated: “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and He has set the world upon them”</b> (I Samuel 2:8). Since the world rests upon the righteous, each generation requires the presence of a righteous person to provide that support. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:8 | as it is stated: “All these matters are wearisome; no man can ever state them” | Yoma 19b:10 | <b>Rabbi Aḥa says: Talk of them</b> means one must <b>render them,</b> the words of Torah, <b>a permanent</b> fixture, <b>and not render them a temporary</b> exercise. <b>Rava said: One who engages in idle chatter</b> without Torah or any particular purpose <b>violates</b> a <b>positive</b> commandment, <b>as it is stated: And you shall talk of them;</b> talk <b>of them and not of other matters. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Furthermore, <b>one</b> even <b>violates a negative</b> commandment, <b>as it is stated: “All these matters are wearisome; no man can ever state them”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:8). The phrase: No man can ever state them, is understood as a prohibition against engaging in idle chatter. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:9 | “There is nothing new under the sun” | Berakhot 59a:3 | The Gemara argues: <b>Then</b> God should have <b>created two other</b> new <b>stars</b> for Pleiades. The Gemara responds: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore</b> those same stars <b>to</b> Ursa Major, <b>as it is stated: “Or can you guide [<i>tanḥem</i>] Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32), which is interpreted homiletically in the sense of consolation [<i>tanḥumim</i>] apparently due to the restoration of those stars. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:9 | there is nothing new under the sun” | Nedarim 39b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the interpretation of the repetitive formulation of the verse is that <b>this is what</b> Moses <b>is saying: If the opening was created for</b> Gehenna, that is <b>optimal, and if not, the Lord should create</b> it now. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And <b>there is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9)? How, then, could Moses request that God create the mouth of Gehenna now? The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Moses <b>said: If the mouth</b> of Gehenna <b>is not close to here, let</b> God <b>bring it closer.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 1:9 | “There is nothing new under the sun” | Sanhedrin 110a:16 | <b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But if the Lord creates a new creation and the earth opens its mouth”</b> (Numbers 16:30)? <b>Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: If Gehenna is</b> already <b>created, good, but if not, God should create</b> it now. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> was Moses asking? <b>If we say</b> that his request was for God <b>to actually create</b> Gehenna, <b>but isn’t</b> it written: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9)? There are no new creations after the six days of Creation. <b>Rather,</b> Moses asked God <b>to bring the opening</b> of Gehenna <b>close</b> to there, so that the assembly of Korah would be buried alive. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:9 | “There is nothing new under the sun” | Shabbat 30b:9 | <b>In matters of Torah, what is</b> the case with regard to which the verse said that one should respond to a fool’s folly? <b>As in</b> the case <b>where Rabban Gamliel was sitting and he interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: In the future,</b> in the World-to-Come, <b>a woman will give birth every day, as it says: “The woman with child and her that gives birth together”</b> (Jeremiah 31:7), explaining that birth will occur on the same day as conception. <b>A certain student scoffed at him</b> and <b>said:</b> That cannot be, as it has already been stated: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: Come and I will show you an example</b> of this <b>in this world. He took him outside and showed him a chicken</b> that lays eggs every day. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:12 | wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem” | Gittin 68b:16 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And this was my portion from all of my toil”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:10), the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“And this”?</b> This expression is always an allusion to an item that is actually in his hand or can be shown. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree with regard to the meaning of this phrase. <b>One said:</b> This is referring to Solomon’s <b>staff</b> that remained in his hand. <b>And one said:</b> This is referring to <b>his cloak.</b> Solomon <b>circulated from door to door</b> collecting charity, and <b>wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>When he</b> finally <b>arrived at the Sanhedrin</b> in Jerusalem <b>the sages said: Now, an imbecile does not fixate on one matter</b> all of the time, so <b>what is this</b> matter? Is this man perhaps telling the truth that he is Solomon? |
| Ecclesiastes 1:12 | he ruled only over Israel, as it is stated: “I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel | Sanhedrin 20b:17 | Reish Lakish continues: <b>And ultimately,</b> Solomon declined further still in that <b>he ruled only over Israel, as it is stated: “I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel</b> in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only Jerusalem, as it is stated: “The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:1). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only his bed, as it is stated: “Behold, it is the bed of Solomon;</b> threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” | Berakhot 26a:19 | With regard to the possibility to compensate for a prayer that he failed to recite at its appointed time, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. The meaning of the verse: <b>“That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15), is as follows: <b>That which is crooked cannot be made straight</b> refers to <b>one who omitted the evening <i>Shema</i> and the morning <i>Shema,</i> or the evening prayer, or the morning prayer. And that which is wanting cannot be numbered [<i>lehimanot</i>]</b> refers to <b>one whose friends reached a consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> to perform <b>a mitzva and he was not part of their consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> and, consequently, he missed his opportunity to join them in performance of the mitzva. This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that there is no way to compensate for a missed prayer. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | about this it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” | Chagigah 9a:4 | If <b>the pilgrimage Festival passed and one did not celebrate</b> by bringing <b>the Festival</b> peace-offering, <b>he is not obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> Even if he consecrated an animal for this purpose and it was lost, once the Festival is over he has no obligation to replace it, as he has missed the opportunity for performing this mitzva. And <b>about this it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15). |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | it. And about this it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” | Chagigah 9b:7 | § The mishna taught that if <b>the pilgrimage Festival passed and one did not celebrate</b> it by sacrificing <b>a Festival</b> peace-offering, <b>he is not obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it. And about this it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15). |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” | Sukkah 27a:4 | <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said: One who did not eat</b> a meal on the <b>evening of the first day</b> of the Festival should <b>compensate</b> with a meal on the <b>evening of the last day of the Festival,</b> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, despite the fact that he will not eat it in the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no compensation for</b> this <b>matter, and with regard to</b> similar cases where it is impossible to rectify failure to fulfill a positive mitzva, <b>it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15). |
| Ecclesiastes 1:15 | Shimon ben Menasya says: Which is: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight” | Yevamot 22b:9 | The Gemara objects: <b>Is he in fact able to repent</b> after fathering a <i>mamzer</i>? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Shimon ben Menasya says: Which is: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>one who engaged in intercourse with a relative</b> who is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>and fathered a <i>mamzer</i> with her.</b> This implies that he has no possibility of achieving total repentance. The Gemara responds: <b>At least now,</b> after repenting, <b>he</b> is considered as one who <b>acts according to the deeds of your people.</b> Although he cannot totally rectify his transgression, his child is liable to receive punishment for cursing or hitting him. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:18 | “For in much wisdom is much vexation” | Nedarim 22b:3 | <b>Rav Adda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Had Israel not sinned</b> in earlier times <b>they would have been given the five books of the Torah and the book of Joshua alone.</b> They needed the book of Joshua <b>because it</b> includes <b>the arrangement of Eretz Yisrael.</b> Since it contains the division of Eretz Yisrael among the tribes, it was required for all generations, but the other books of the prophets primarily detail the history of how Israel angered God and He sent prophets to admonish them. <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., what is the allusion to this idea? It is stated: <b>“For in much wisdom is much vexation”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:18). All the wisdom that the Jews possess from the books of the Bible is the result of their angering God. |
| Ecclesiastes 1:18 | as it is written: “And he that increases knowledge, increases sorrow” | Sukkah 42b:2 | If he is one who <b>is able to eat an olive-bulk of grain, one distances</b> himself <b>four cubits from his feces and from his urine</b> before praying or reciting <i>Shema</i>, as the feces and urine of a child at that stage of development produce offensive odors like those of an adult. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that</b> the minor <b>can eat</b> the olive-bulk of grain <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. However, if it takes him longer, one need not distance himself before praying. <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Yeiva, said: And with regard to an adult, even if he is unable to eat</b> an olive-bulk of grain <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, one must distance himself from his feces before praying, <b>as it is written: “And he that increases knowledge, increases sorrow”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:18), meaning that as one grows older he becomes more flawed. |
| Ecclesiastes 2:2 | and it is written: “I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy” | Shabbat 30b:4 | <b>And</b> to the essence of the matter, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Its statements</b> that <b>contradict each other? It is written: “Vexation is better than laughter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:3), <b>and it is written: “I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2), which is understood to mean that laughter is commendable. Likewise in one verse <b>it is written: “So I commended mirth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:15), <b>and</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “And of mirth: What does it accomplish?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the contradiction can be resolved. <b>Vexation is better than laughter</b> means: The <b>vexation</b> of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, toward the righteous in this world is preferable to the laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the wicked in this world</b> by showering them with goodness. <b>I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy, that is</b> the <b>laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the righteous in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 2:8 | “I got myself sharim and sharot , and human pleasures, shidda and shiddot ” | Gittin 68a:5 | § After mentioning the spirit named <i>kordeyakos</i> on the previous <i>daf</i> the Gemara relates other matters connected to spirits and demons. It is written: <b>“I got myself <i>sharim</i> and <i>sharot</i>, and human pleasures, <i>shidda</i> and <i>shiddot</i>”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:8). The Gemara explains: <b>“<i>Sharim</i> and <i>sharot</i>”: These are types of musical</b> instruments. <b>“And human pleasures”: These are pools and bathhouses. “<i>Shidda</i> and <i>shiddot</i>”: Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> these words in the following manner: <b>Male demons [<i>shidda</i>] and female demons [<i>shiddetin</i>]. In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they said</b> that these words are referring to <b>carriages [<i>shiddeta</i>].</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 2:10 | “And this was my portion from all of my toil” | Gittin 68b:16 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And this was my portion from all of my toil”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:10), the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“And this”?</b> This expression is always an allusion to an item that is actually in his hand or can be shown. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree with regard to the meaning of this phrase. <b>One said:</b> This is referring to Solomon’s <b>staff</b> that remained in his hand. <b>And one said:</b> This is referring to <b>his cloak.</b> Solomon <b>circulated from door to door</b> collecting charity, and <b>wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>When he</b> finally <b>arrived at the Sanhedrin</b> in Jerusalem <b>the sages said: Now, an imbecile does not fixate on one matter</b> all of the time, so <b>what is this</b> matter? Is this man perhaps telling the truth that he is Solomon? |
| Ecclesiastes 2:10 | he ruled over only his staff, as it is stated: “And this was my portion from all of my labor” | Sanhedrin 20b:18 | <b>And ultimately,</b> he declined so much that <b>he ruled over only his staff, as it is stated: “And this was my portion from all of my labor”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:10). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to the meaning of this latter verse as well. <b>One says</b> that the term “this” is a reference to <b>his staff, and one says</b> that it is a reference to <b>his cloak.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 2:14 | the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness” | Chullin 44a:1 | And one who wishes to adopt both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 2:14 | the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness” | Eruvin 6b:12 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>But do we adopt the</b> respective <b>stringencies of two</b> authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> If he wishes to adopt both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel,</b> he is <b>a wicked person.</b> And if he wishes to adopt both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> he should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 2:14 | about himself: “The wise man, his eyes are in his head” | Pesachim 106a:9 | Rav Ashi was unsure what they meant by the term great <i>kiddush</i> and wondered if the residents of Meḥoza included other matters in their <i>kiddush</i>. <b>He thought: What is this great <i>kiddush</i></b> to which they refer? <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>Since</b> with regard to <b>all the blessings</b> that require a cup of wine, <b>one first recites</b> the blessing: <b>Who creates the fruit of the vine,</b> I will start with that blessing. <b>He recited: Who creates the fruit of the vine, and lengthened it</b> to see if they were expecting an additional blessing. <b>He saw a particular elder bending over his cup and drinking,</b> and he realized that this was the end of the great <i>kiddush</i>. <b>He read</b> the following verse <b>about himself: “The wise man, his eyes are in his head”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14), as he was alert enough to discern the expectations of the local residents. |
| Ecclesiastes 2:14 | the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness” | Rosh Hashanah14b:5 | The Gemara questions Rabbi Akiva’s conduct: <b>But do we adopt the</b> respective <b>stringencies of two</b> authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> If he adopts both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel,</b> he is <b>a wicked person.</b> And if he adopts both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b> If so, why did Rabbi Akiva follow two contradictory stringencies? |
| Ecclesiastes 2:26 | “He gives to a man that is good in His sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy” | Megillah 10b:28 | <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana introduced this passage with an introduction from here.</b> The verse states with regard to God’s reward to the righteous: <b>“He gives to a man that is good in His sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>the righteous Mordecai.</b> With regard to the next part of the verse: <b>“But to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and heaping up,” this is</b> referring to <b>Haman.</b> The conclusion of the verse states: <b>“That he may give it to one who is good before God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). <b>This is Mordecai and Esther, as it is written: “And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman”</b> (Esther 8:2). |
| Ecclesiastes 3:7 | states: “A time to keep silence, and a time to speak” | Zevachim 115b:14 | <b>And likewise in</b> a verse written by <b>David</b> it <b>states: “Resign yourself [<i>dom</i>] to the Lord, and wait patiently [<i>vehitḥolel</i>] for Him”</b> (Psalms 37:7). <b>Although He strikes down many corpses [<i>ḥalalim</i>]</b> around <b>you, you be silent</b> and do not complain. <b>And likewise in</b> a verse written by <b>Solomon</b> it <b>states: “A time to keep silence, and a time to speak”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:7). There are <b>times that</b> one <b>is silent and receives reward for the silence,</b> and at <b>times</b> one <b>speaks and receives reward for the speech.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 3:11 | that which is written: “He has made everything beautiful in its time, | Berakhot 43b:5 | <b>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “He has made everything beautiful in its time,</b> and He has placed the world in their heart, yet so man cannot find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11)? This <b>teaches that each and every individual, God has made his work pleasant for him in his own eyes.</b> In that way, each individual will be satisfied with his work, enabling the world to function properly. |
| Ecclesiastes 3:14 | And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is worse than lashes, as it is stated: “God has so made it, that men should fear before Him” | Berakhot 55a:15 | Related to what was stated above, that one should pray for a good dream, the Gemara cites additional maxims concerning dreams and their interpretation. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> One should see <b>any dream, and not a fast.</b> In other words, any dream is preferable to a dream during a fast. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A dream not interpreted is like a letter not read.</b> As long as it is not interpreted it cannot be fulfilled; the interpretation of a dream creates its meaning. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A good dream is not entirely fulfilled and a bad dream is not entirely fulfilled. And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is preferable to a good dream,</b> as a bad dream causes one to feel remorse and to repent. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream, his sadness is enough for him; a good dream, his joy is enough for him.</b> This means that the sadness or joy engendered by the dream renders the actual fulfillment of the dream superfluous. Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef said: Even for me, the joy of a good dream negates it.</b> Even Rav Yosef, who was blind and ill, derived such pleasure from a good dream that it was never actually realized. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is worse than lashes, as it is stated: “God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14), <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is a bad dream</b> that causes man to fear. |
| Ecclesiastes 3:14 | straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him” | Berakhot 59a:12 | <b>Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Thunder was created only</b> to impose fear and <b>straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14). <b>And Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees a rainbow in a cloud must fall upon his face, as it is stated: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud</b> in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. <b>And when I saw it, I fell upon my face”</b> (Ezekiel 1:28). The colors of the rainbow symbolize the glory of God and one may not stare at them. Yet, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would curse</b> one who fell upon his face when seeing a rainbow <b>because it appears as one who is bowing to the rainbow.</b> As far as <b>blessing</b> is concerned, <b>however,</b> all agree that <b>one certainly recites a blessing. What</b> blessing <b>does one recite? Blessed…Who remembers the covenant</b> with Noah. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that the blessing is: Blessed…<b>Who is faithful to His covenant and fulfills His word. Rav Pappa said: Therefore we will say them both</b> combined: <b>Blessed…Who remembers the covenant and is faithful to His covenant and fulfills His word.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 3:14 | it is stated: “And God has so made it that men should fear before Him” | Shabbat 31b:1 | <b>fear of Heaven</b> is <b>like a treasurer [<i>gizbar</i>] to whom they gave keys to the inner doors</b> of the treasury <b>but they did not give keys</b> to the <b>outer</b> door. <b>With what</b> key <b>will he enter?</b> Although the Torah is the inner key, without fear of Heaven one cannot gain access to the genuine Torah. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> would <b>proclaim: Woe unto</b> one <b>who does not have a courtyard, and who makes a fence for the courtyard,</b> i.e., a person who lacks fear of Heaven and is nevertheless involved in Torah study. <b>Rav Yehuda said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, only created His world so that people would fear before Him,</b> as <b>it is stated: “And God has so made it that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14). |
| Ecclesiastes 4:2 | and you said: “And I praised the dead that are already dead | Shabbat 30a:3 | The Gemara relates: <b>This question was asked before Rabbi Tanḥum from</b> the village of <b>Nevi: What is</b> the ruling <b>with regard to extinguishing a burning lamp before a sick person on Shabbat?</b> The Gemara relates that Rabbi Tanḥum delivered an entire homily touching upon both aggadic and halakhic materials surrounding this question. <b>He began and said: You,</b> King <b>Solomon, where is your wisdom, where is your understanding? Not only do your statements contradict</b> the <b>statements of your father David, but your statements</b> even <b>contradict each other. Your father David said: “The dead praise not the Lord,</b> neither any that go down into silence” (Psalms 115:17); <b>and you said: “And I praised the dead that are already dead</b> more than the living that are yet alive” (Ecclesiastes 4:2). <b>And then again you said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:4). These are different assessments of life and death. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:9 | “Two are better than one” | Megillah 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>My teacher, the incident did not</b> occur in <b>this</b> fashion. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi never sought to abolish the fast of the Ninth of Av. <b>Rather, it was</b> a year when <b>the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and they postponed it until after Shabbat. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> about that case: <b>Since it has</b> already <b>been deferred</b> from its usual time, <b>let it be</b> altogether <b>deferred</b> this year. <b>And the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Abba bar Zavda: <b>“Two are better than one”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:9), meaning, it is good that you were here to provide an accurate report about that incident. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:12 | and a threefold cord is not quickly broken” | Bava Batra59a:5 | It <b>was stated</b> that there is a dispute with regard to this issue, as <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The owner of the courtyard <b>can prevent</b> the owner of the roof from sealing the pipe, while <b>Rabbi Ḥama,</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s father, <b>says: He cannot prevent</b> it. Rabbi Oshaya <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rabbi Ḥama’s father, <b>Rabbi Bisa.</b> Rabbi Bisa <b>said to them:</b> He <b>can prevent</b> it. <b>Rami bar Ḥama read</b> the verse <b>about</b> him: “And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; <b>and a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12), saying that <b>this</b> applies to <b>Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Bisa,</b> three generations of Torah scholars in one family who knew one another and conversed with each other with regard to matters of <i>halakha</i>. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:12 | about him: “A threefold cord is not quickly broken” | Ketubot 62b:14 | Rabbi Ḥama <b>went in to his house</b> and <b>his son went in</b> with him. Rabbi Ḥama then <b>stood up before him</b> to honor a Torah scholar, since <b>he thought</b> that <b>he wanted to ask him a matter of <i>halakha</i>. His wife said to him: Is there a father who stands up before his son?</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rami bar Ḥama read</b> the verse <b>about him: “A threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Ḥama bar Bisa,</b> as he represented the third generation of Torah scholars in his family. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:12 | will not be quick to sin, as it is stated: “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken” | Kiddushin 40b:5 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> the study of <b>Bible, and in</b> the study of <b>Mishna, and in</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> i.e., he performs labor and generally acts in an appropriate manner, <b>will not be quick to sin, as it is stated: “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). One who is involved in all three of these activities will not sin easily. <b>And anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior, is not part of society,</b> i.e., he is not considered a civilized person at all. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:12 | “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken” | Menachot 43b:12 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Anyone who has phylacteries on his head, phylacteries on his arm, ritual fringes on his garment, and a <i>mezuza</i> on his doorway is strengthened</b> from <b>all</b> sides <b>so that he will not sin, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). This is interpreted as an allusion to the three mitzvot of phylacteries, ritual fringes, and <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him, and delivers them”</b> (Psalms 34:8). This is interpreted to mean that the angel of the Lord surrounds those who fulfill the mitzvot and saves them from sin. |
| Ecclesiastes 4:17 | that which is written: “Guard your foot when you go to the house of God, | Berakhot 23a:6 | In this context, the Gemara cites an additional statement, which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Guard your foot when you go to the house of God,</b> and prepare to listen; it is better than when fools offer sacrifices, as they know not to do evil” (Ecclesiastes 4:17)? It means: When you enter the house of the Lord, <b>guard yourself from transgression, and if you commit a transgression, bring a sacrifice before Me</b> in atonement. The verse continues: <b>“And draw near and listen to the words of the wise.” Rava said: Be prepared to hearken to the words of the wise, who, if they commit a transgression, they bring a sacrifice and repent.</b> He interprets the next part of the verse: <b>“It is better than when fools give sacrifices,”</b> that <b>one should not act like the fools who commit a transgression and bring a sacrifice but do not repent.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:1 | Rav said in the name of Rabbi Meir: One’s words should always be few before the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Be not rash with your mouth and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and you upon earth. Therefore, let your words be few” | Berakhot 61a:2 | <b>And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Meir: One’s words should always be few before the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Be not rash with your mouth and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and you upon earth. Therefore, let your words be few”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:1). |
| Ecclesiastes 5:4 | And it is written: “It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay” | Chullin 2a:6 | <b>And it is written: “It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:4); <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that verse: <b>Better than</b> both <b>this</b> one, who vows and does not pay, <b>and that</b> one, who vows and pays, is <b>one who does not take a vow at all;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Better than</b> both <b>this</b> one, who vows and does not pay, <b>and that</b> one, who does not vow at all, is <b>one who vows and pays</b> in fulfillment of that vow. Rav Aḥa comments: <b>And even Rabbi Yehuda states</b> his opinion <b>only in</b> a case where one vows and <b>says: This</b> animal <b>is</b> designated for sacrifice, as in that case there is no concern that he will fail to fulfill his commitment, since even if the animal is stolen or lost, he is not required to bring another in its place. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:4 | said to him: The Torah said: “Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay” | Menachot 81a:11 | Ravina <b>said to him: The Torah said: “Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:4), <b>and you say: Let him rise up and vow <i>ab initio</i>?</b> Taking a vow to bring an offering is not encouraged. As all possible remedies have been rejected, the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya, that there is no remedy in a case where a thanks offering and its substitute were intermingled and one of them died, stands. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:4 | “Better that you should not vow, | Nedarim 9a:7 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“Better that you should not vow,</b> than that you should vow and not pay” (Ecclesiastes 5:4), that <b>better than</b> both <b>this and that</b> is one <b>who does not take a vow at all.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Better than</b> both <b>this and that is one who vows and pays.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Meir advocates abstaining from all vows and Rabbi Yehuda advocates making vows and fulfilling them, but neither of them distinguishes between vows and gift offerings. The mishna, however, indicates that virtuous people do not make vows but do bring gift offerings. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:5 | With regard to him, the verse states: “Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into guilt” | Chagigah 15a:5 | § The Gemara stated earlier that <b><i>Aḥer</i> chopped down the saplings,</b> becoming a heretic. <b>With regard to him, the verse states: “Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The Gemara poses a question: <b>What was</b> it that led him to heresy? <b>He saw</b> the angel <b>Mitatron, who was granted permission to sit and write the merits</b> of <b>Israel. He said:</b> There is <b>a tradition</b> that in the world <b>above there is no sitting; no competition; no</b> turning one’s <b>back before Him,</b> i.e., all face the Divine Presence; <b>and no lethargy.</b> Seeing that someone other than God was seated above, <b>he said: Perhaps,</b> the Gemara here interjects, <b>Heaven forbid, there are two authorities,</b> and there is another source of power in control of the world in addition to God. Such thoughts led <i>Aḥer</i> to heresy. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:5 | from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt” | Shevuot 39a:2 | <b>And</b> be aware that <b>with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7); <b>whereas here,</b> with regard to taking a false oath, <b>it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>].” And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The verse indicates that one who sins with his mouth, by taking a false oath, causes his flesh to be punished as well; <b>and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). |
| Ecclesiastes 5:6 | mercy, as it is stated: “For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are many words; but fear God” | Berakhot 10b:1 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: Even if the master of dreams,</b> in a true dream, an angel (<i>Ma’ayan HaBerakhot</i>) <b>tells a person that tomorrow he will die, he should not prevent himself from</b> praying for <b>mercy, as it is stated: “For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are many words; but fear God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:6). Although the dream may seem real to him, that is not necessarily the case, and one must place his trust in God. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:9 | which is written: “He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance with increase” | Makkot 10a:16 | On a related note, <b>Rabbi Simai taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance with increase”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:9)? <b>“He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Moses our teacher,</b> whose love of mitzvot was so great <b>that</b> although <b>he knew that</b> an unintentional murderer <b>would not be admitted to the three cities</b> of refuge <b>that were in</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan until</b> the <b>three</b> cities of refuge <b>that</b> were <b>in the land of Canaan were selected, and</b> that his designation of cities of refuge would have no practical ramifications in his lifetime, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>said:</b> When there is <b>a mitzva that has come my way, I will fulfill it.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:9 | a mnemonic | Makkot 10a:19 | The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing interpretations of the second part of the verse cited earlier (Ecclesiastes 5:9): <b>Ashi to study, Ravina to teach.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:9 | Ravina says | Makkot 10a:21 | <b>Ravina says</b> that there is a different interpretation of the verse cited earlier (Ecclesiastes 5:9): <b>Anyone who loves to teach in abundance,</b> before the multitudes, <b>to him shall be increase,</b> as his Torah knowledge is enhanced through those lectures. <b>And that is</b> the parallel to that <b>which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Much Torah have I studied from my teachers, and</b> I have learned <b>more from my colleagues</b> than <b>from them, and</b> I have learned <b>more from my students</b> than <b>from all of them.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:10 | from here: “When goods increase, those who consume them increase; and what advantage is there to the owner, | Menachot 110a:16 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “When goods increase, those who consume them increase; and what advantage is there to the owner,</b> except seeing them with his eyes?” (Ecclesiastes 5:10). One who brings a substantial offering, who thereby increases the number of priests who partake of it, does not have more merit than one who brings a meager offering. Rather, the offering that God desires is one where He recognizes, i.e., “seeing them with His eyes,” that its owner has the proper intent. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:11 | “Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he consumes little or much” | Menachot 110a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> from which this principle is derived? <b>“Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he consumes little or much”</b>(Ecclesiastes 5:11).The verse is interpreted as referring to one who brings an offering, and teaches that one who brings a substantial offering and one who brings a meager offering can be equally assured that their offering will be accepted. |
| Ecclesiastes 5:12 | “Riches kept by his owner to his hurt” | Pesachim 119a:12 | With regard to Korah’s wealth, the Gemara cites the verse: <b>“Riches kept by his owner to his hurt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:12). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This is the wealth of Korah,</b> which caused him to grow arrogant and lead to his destruction. <b>As it is stated:</b> “And what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, <b>and all the sustenance that was at their feet”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:6). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> is referring to <b>a person’s money that stands him upon his</b> own two <b>feet. Rabbi Levi said: The keys to Korah’s treasuries were</b> a <b>load of three hundred</b> strong <b>white mules, and they were all keys [<i>aklidei</i>] and locks</b> made <b>of leather.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 5:12 | “Wealth is kept for the owner to his detriment” | Sanhedrin 110a:11 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“Wealth is kept for the owner to his detriment”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:12), <b>Reish Lakish says: This</b> is referring to <b>the wealth of Korah,</b> which was of no use to him. The fact that Korah was wealthy is derived from the verse: <b>“And all the substance that was at their feet”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:6), as <b>Rabbi Elazar says: This</b> is referring to <b>a person’s property, which stands him on his feet. And Rabbi Levi says: The keys</b> alone <b>to Korah’s treasury were a burden</b> requiring <b>three hundred white mules</b> to transport them, <b>and</b> moreover, <b>all the keys [<i>aklidei</i>] and locks were of leather.</b> This conveys the vastness of his wealth. |
| Ecclesiastes 6:9 | “Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire” | Yoma 74b:15 | <b>Rav Yosef said: From here</b> there is an <b>allusion</b> to the idea <b>that blind</b> people <b>eat but are not</b> fully <b>satisfied</b> when they eat because they cannot see their food. Seeing the food contributes to the enjoyment of eating. <b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> from what we have just learned, <b>one who has a meal should eat it only during daytime,</b> when there is light to see the food that is being eaten. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire”</b> (Ecclesiastes 6:9). On the same verse, <b>Reish Lakish said: The sight of a woman is better than the actual act</b> of relations, <b>as it is stated: “Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.”</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:1 | “A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth” | Berakhot 17a:6 | <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan would conclude</b> study of <b>the book of Job, he said the following:</b> <br><b>A person will ultimately die and an animal will ultimately be slaughtered, and all are destined for death.</b> Therefore, death itself is not a cause for great anguish. <br>Rather, <b>happy is he who grew up in Torah, whose labor is in Torah,</b> <br><b>who gives pleasure to his Creator,</b> <br><b>who grew up with a good name and who took leave of the world with a good name.</b> <br>Such a person lived his life fully, <b>and about him, Solomon said:</b> <br><b>“A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:1); one who was faultless in life reaches the day of his death on a higher level than he was at the outset. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:2 | which is written: “It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, since that is the end of all men, and the living will take it to heart” | Ketubot 72a:2 | Similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir used to say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, since that is the end of all men, and the living will take it to heart”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:2)? <b>What</b> does <b>“and the living will take it to heart”</b> mean? It means that they will take <b>matters</b> relating <b>to death</b> to heart, realizing that they too will eventually die. He <b>who eulogizes</b> others, people <b>will eulogize him;</b> he <b>who buries</b> someone, people <b>will bury him;</b> he <b>who lifts</b> others to bring them to burial, people <b>will</b> similarly <b>lift</b> him to bring him to burial; he <b>who escorts</b> others out for burial, people <b>will</b> similarly <b>escort him;</b> he <b>who carries</b> others, others <b>will carry him.</b> Therefore, one who does not come to a house of mourning to comfort the bereaved will himself not be treated with proper dignity when he dies. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:2 | and the living will lay it to his heart” | Moed Katan28b:9 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> with regard to the verse <b>“It is better to go to the house of mourning</b> than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men; <b>and the living will lay it to his heart”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:2): What should the living lay to his heart? <b>Matters relating to death.</b> And these matters are as follows: He <b>that eulogizes will be eulogized</b> by others. He <b>that buries</b> others <b>will be buried</b> by others. He <b>that loads</b> many words of praise and tribute into the eulogies that he delivers for others <b>will be</b> similarly <b>treated</b> by others. He <b>that raises</b> his voice in weeping over others <b>will</b> have others <b>raise</b> their voices <b>over him.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:2 | As it is written: “And the living shall lay it to his heart” | Nedarim 83b:2 | The Gemara rejects this argument: The Sages <b>say</b> in response that a woman who vows that <b>impurity</b> imparted <b>by the dead</b> is forbidden <b>to</b> her <b>also suffers pain</b> as a result. How so? <b>As it is written: “And the living shall lay it to his heart”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:2), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the living shall lay it to his heart”?</b> This means that one <b>who eulogizes</b> others when they die <b>will</b> in turn <b>be eulogized</b> when he himself dies; one <b>who weeps</b> for others <b>will be wept for</b> when he himself passes away; and one <b>who buries</b> others <b>will</b> himself <b>be buried</b> upon his passing. A woman who cannot participate in the funerals of others because she is barred from contracting impurity through contact with a corpse is distressed by the thought that she will receive similar treatment when she dies. Therefore, her vow involves affliction and can be nullified by her husband. The conclusion is that this case does not present a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:3 | contradict each other? It is written: “Vexation is better than laughter” | Shabbat 30b:4 | <b>And</b> to the essence of the matter, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Its statements</b> that <b>contradict each other? It is written: “Vexation is better than laughter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:3), <b>and it is written: “I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2), which is understood to mean that laughter is commendable. Likewise in one verse <b>it is written: “So I commended mirth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:15), <b>and</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “And of mirth: What does it accomplish?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the contradiction can be resolved. <b>Vexation is better than laughter</b> means: The <b>vexation</b> of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, toward the righteous in this world is preferable to the laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the wicked in this world</b> by showering them with goodness. <b>I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy, that is</b> the <b>laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the righteous in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:9 | forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools” | Nedarim 22b:2 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Anyone who gets angry,</b> at that moment <b>even the Divine Presence is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God”</b> (Psalms 10:4). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> Anyone who gets angry <b>forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:9), <b>and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to one who gets angry, <b>it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in transgression”</b> (Proverbs 29:22). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:10 | says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these? | Rosh Hashanah25b:3 | <b>And it</b> further <b>says: “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9). <b>But</b> can it <b>enter your mind that a person</b> can <b>go to a judge that is not</b> alive <b>in his days?</b> What, then, is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? It teaches that <b>you</b> need <b>to go only to the judge in one’s days,</b> i.e., he is authorized to judge and decide matters. <b>And it</b> also <b>says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these?</b> For it is not out of wisdom that you inquire concerning this” (Ecclesiastes 7:10). Instead, one must accept the rulings of the leaders of his generation. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:11 | about Rav Sheshet: “Wisdom is good with an inheritance” | Bekhorot 52b:14 | <b>Rav Ḥama read</b> the verse <b>about Rav Sheshet: “Wisdom is good with an inheritance”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:11), i.e., it is not enough to inherit knowledge of <i>baraitot</i>, as does Rav Sheshet; rather, one must also be expert in the wisdom of <i>amora’im</i>. Rav Ḥama explained: <b>Didn’t</b> Rav Sheshet <b>hear this</b> matter, <b>that when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua,</b> who is the <i>tanna</i> Rabbi Elazar in the mishna: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: <b>They return</b> in the Jubilee Year? It means that <b>they return for naught,</b> and they forfeit that which they received. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:12 | “Wisdom preserves the life of him that has it” | Chullin 59a:2 | <b>Rav Yehuda says: This</b> individual <b>who eats</b> the weight of <b>three shekel of asafoetida on an empty heart,</b> i.e., stomach, <b>his skin sheds</b> due to the fever he contracts. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: There was an incident in which I</b> was involved, wherein <b>I ate</b> the weight of <b>one shekel of asafoetida, and had I not</b> immediately <b>sat in water</b> to cool off, <b>my skin would have shed. And I</b> thereby <b>fulfilled with regard to myself</b> that which the verse states: <b>“Wisdom preserves the life of him that has it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:12 | as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who casts merchandise into the purse of Torah scholars is rewarded and sits in the heavenly academy, as it is stated: “For in the shadow of wisdom, is the shadow of money” | Pesachim 53b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said:</b> Theodosius <b>was</b> one who <b>cast</b> the profits from <b>merchandise into the purse of Torah scholars.</b> He would lend them money and enter into partnership with them so they could open businesses, and that is praiseworthy, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who casts merchandise into the purse of Torah scholars is rewarded and sits in the heavenly academy, as it is stated: “For in the shadow of wisdom, is the shadow of money”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). One who provides Torah scholars with money will merit being with them in the shadow of wisdom. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:12 | “Wisdom preserves the life of he who has it” | Yevamot 64b:7 | The Gemara similarly relates that <b>Rav Giddel became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse, Rav Ḥelbo became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse,</b> and <b>Rav Sheshet became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov was afflicted by <i>suskhinta</i>,</b> a disease caused by holding back from urinating. <b>They suspended him from the cedar</b> column that supported <b>the study hall, and</b> a substance that was as <b>green</b> as a palm <b>leaf emerged from him,</b> and he was healed. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: We were sixty elders</b> present at the time, <b>and they all became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse, aside from me, as I fulfilled with regard to myself</b> the verse: <b>“Wisdom preserves the life of he who has it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). I used the above cure to avoid becoming impotent. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:12 | “Wisdom preserves the lives of those who have it” | Yoma 83b:10 | <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In the case of <b>one who is seized with <i>bulmos</i>, one feeds him a sheep’s tail with honey,</b> since the combination of the fatty meat and the honey helps greatly. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Also, fine wheat flour with honey</b> is a remedy. <b>Rav Pappa said: Even barley flour with honey</b> is good for curing <i>bulmos</i>. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once I was seized with <i>bulmos</i> and I ran to the east side of a fig tree</b> and found ripe figs there, which I ate. Figs on a tree do not all ripen at once but ripen first on the side where the sun rises, so Rabbi Yoḥanan searched first for figs on the east side of the tree. <b>And I</b> thereby <b>fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“Wisdom preserves the lives of those who have it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). <b>As Rav Yosef taught: One who wishes to taste the flavor of the fig should turn to the east, as it is stated: “And for the precious things of the sun’s fruits”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:14), implying that the sun ripens fruit and makes them sweet. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:12 | “Wisdom preserves the lives of those who have it” | Yoma 84a:2 | The Gemara comments: This <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel: When one kills</b> a mad dog, <b>he should kill it only with a thrown object.</b> Furthermore, <b>one who is rubbed by a mad dog will become dangerously</b> ill, while <b>one bitten</b> by the dog <b>will die.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the remedy</b> for <b>one who is rubbed by mad dog</b> and <b>becomes dangerously ill?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let him take off his clothing and run.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, was rubbed by one of these</b> mad dogs <b>in the market,</b> whereupon <b>he took off his clothing and ran. He said: I have fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“Wisdom preserves the lives of those who have it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:14 | which is written: “God has made even the one as well as the other” | Chagigah 15a:8 | The Gemara relates: <b><i>Aḥer</i> asked Rabbi Meir</b> a question, <b>after he had gone astray. He said to him: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “God has made even the one as well as the other”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:14)? Rabbi Meir <b>said to him: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created</b> a similar creation <b>corresponding to it. He created mountains, He created hills; He created seas, He created rivers.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:16 | came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly righteous” | Yoma 22b:9 | <b>And</b> he further reasoned: <b>If the men have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the animals sinned?</b> Why, then, should the Amalekites’ livestock be destroyed? <b>And if the adults have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the children sinned? A Divine Voice</b> then <b>came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly righteous”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:16). That is to say: Do not be more merciful than the Creator Himself, Who has commanded you to do this, for to do so would not be an indication of righteousness but of weakness. At a later time, <b>when Saul said to Doeg: “Turn around and strike down the priests,</b> and Doeg the Edomite turned around and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod, and he struck Nob the city of priests by the sword, man and woman alike, infants and sucklings alike, oxen and donkeys and sheep, by the sword” (I Samuel 22:18–19), <b>a Divine Voice came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly wicked”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:17). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:17 | that which is written: “Be not overmuch wicked” | Shabbat 31b:4 | <b>Rav Ulla taught: What</b> is the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Be not overmuch wicked”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:17)? This appears difficult, as, is that to say that only <b>overmuch one should not be wicked; a little, one should be wicked? Rather,</b> this can be understood based on the following adage: <b>One who ate</b> a clove of <b>garlic and its odor spreads,</b> should <b>he again eat</b> another clove of <b>garlic so that its odor will spread</b> further? If you were somewhat wicked, do not think that it is legitimate to continue and be very wicked. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:17 | a Divine Voice came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly wicked” | Yoma 22b:9 | <b>And</b> he further reasoned: <b>If the men have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the animals sinned?</b> Why, then, should the Amalekites’ livestock be destroyed? <b>And if the adults have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the children sinned? A Divine Voice</b> then <b>came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly righteous”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:16).

| Ecclesiastes 7:19 | “Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers | Nedarim 32b:5 | The Gemara interprets the following verse in a similar homiletical manner: <b>“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers</b> that are in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). <b>“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man,” this</b> is referring to <b>repentance and good deeds. “More than ten rulers,”</b> these are <b>the two eyes, and two ears, and two hands, and two legs, and the tip of the sex organ, and the mouth,</b> which are the limbs that are used by a person to interact with the world. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:20 | said to him, you taught us, our teacher: “For there is not a righteous man upon earth who does good and sins not” | Sanhedrin 101a:12 | Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>for that</b> reason that <b>I am laughing. As long as I would see</b> for <b>my teacher that neither does his wine ferment</b> and spoil, <b>nor is his flax stricken, nor does his oil spoil, nor does his honey turn rancid, I would say</b> to myself: <b>Perhaps, Heaven forfend, my teacher</b> has already <b>received his world</b> in reward for the mitzvot that he fulfilled, and will not receive a reward in the World-to-Come. <b>But now that I see my teacher</b> overcome <b>with suffering, I am happy.</b> He is receiving punishment in this world for the few transgressions that he might have committed, ensuring that he will receive a complete reward in the World-to-Come. Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Akiva, have I failed</b> to fulfill any portion <b>of the entire Torah?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him, you taught us, our teacher: “For there is not a righteous man upon earth who does good and sins not”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:20). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:20 | there is no righteous person on earth who does good and never sins” | Sanhedrin 46b:17 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the righteous</b> patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <b>were</b> all <b>buried. And if you say</b> that burial is required <b>on account of atonement, do the righteous need atonement?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Yes,</b> even the righteous are in need of atonement, <b>as it is written:</b> “For <b>there is no righteous person on earth who does good and never sins”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:20), and so even the righteous need atonement for the few sins that they committed over the course of their lifetimes. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:23 | Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me” | Niddah 9a:19 | The Gemara concludes the discussion of the purification waters with the following observation: <b>And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> King <b>Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:23). According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water, as it renders an impure person pure, and a pure person impure. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:23 | Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me” | Yoma 14a:8 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> would respond to that <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>That is what</b> King <b>Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:23). According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water that purifies an impure person and impurifies a pure person. <b>And the Rabbis</b> ascribe Solomon’s bewilderment to a different aspect of the <i>halakha</i>: <b>The one who sprinkles</b> the water <b>and the one upon whom one sprinkles</b> the water are <b>pure; but one who touches</b> the water unrelated to sprinkling is <b>impure.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | motzeh , as it is written: “And I find [ motzeh ] the woman more bitter than death” | Berakhot 8a:10 | <b>In Eretz Yisrael,</b> the custom was that <b>when a man married a woman, they would ask him: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motzeh</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom whether the appropriate passage for his wife is the above verse from Proverbs that begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: “He who finds a wife finds good and obtains favor from the Lord”</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motzeh</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motzeh</i>] the woman more bitter than death”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | is snares and nets” | Sanhedrin 22b:2 | The Gemara wonders: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yehuda</b> once <b>read to Rav Yitzḥak, his son,</b> from the verse: <b>“And I find more bitter than death the woman whose</b> heart <b>is snares and nets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26)? <b>And</b> Rav Yitzḥak <b>said to him: Such as whom? And</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Such as your mother.</b> The Gemara responds: This is not a contradiction. Granted, <b>she is difficult</b> and angry, but afterward she <b>is conciliatory,</b> so she is both more bitter than death and a source of calmness and joy for him, at different times. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | “And I find more bitter than death the woman, etc.” | Yevamot 63a:12 | The Gemara cites more statements with regard to wives. When <b>Rav was taking leave of</b> his uncle and teacher, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> upon his return from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: May the Merciful One save you from something that is worse than death.</b> Rav was perplexed: <b>Is there anything that is worse than death? He went, examined</b> the sources, <b>and found</b> the following verse: <b>“And I find more bitter than death the woman, etc.”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). Rabbi Ḥiyya was hinting at this verse, and indeed, <b>Rav’s wife would</b> constantly <b>aggravate him. When he would say to her: Prepare me lentils, she would prepare him peas;</b> if he asked her for <b>peas, she would prepare him lentils.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | “And I find more bitter than death the woman” | Yevamot 63b:1 | <b>from sin.</b> We should therefore show our gratitude to them. The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>Rav Yehuda</b> was <b>teaching</b> Torah <b>to Rav Yitzḥak, his son,</b> and they encountered the verse: <b>“And I find more bitter than death the woman”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). His son <b>said to him: For example, whom?</b> His father replied: <b>For example, your mother.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 7:26 | motze , as it is written: “And I find [ motze ] more bitter than death the woman” | Yevamot 63b:4 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Once a man marries a woman his iniquities crumble [<i>mitpakekin</i>], as it is stated: “Whoever finds a wife finds good, and obtains [<i>veyafek</i>] favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 18:22). <b>In the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>when a man married a woman they would say to him as follows: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motze</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom if the appropriate passage for his wife is that verse, which begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: Whoever finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds good,</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motze</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motze</i>] more bitter than death the woman”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:27 | adding one thing to another, to find out the account” | Sotah 8b:17 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that each and every <i>peruta</i> combine</b> to add up <b>to a great sum,</b> alluding to the notion that even if one is not immediately punished for a small transgression, in the final accounting all misdeeds will combine together and be addressed by the imposition of a large punishment? <b>The verse states:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27). |
| Ecclesiastes 7:27 | adding one thing to another, to find out the account” | Sotah 9a:5 | § The Gemara questions the need for two verses to indicate that small transgressions are addressed through one significant punishment. <b>And since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> that small transgressions are combined and punished together <b>from:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“For every boot stamped with fierceness”</b> (Isaiah 9:4)? The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach that even small transgressions are punished <b>by the measure,</b> i.e., with a punishment appropriate to the transgression. |
| Ecclesiastes 7:28 | is written: “A man one of a thousand I have found, and a woman among all those have I not found” | Gittin 45a:18 | § The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman’s daughters would stir a</b> boiling <b>pot with their</b> bare <b>hands,</b> and people thought that the heat did not harm them due to their righteousness. <b>Rav Ilish had a difficulty</b> with a verse, as it <b>is written: “A man one of a thousand I have found, and a woman among all those have I not found”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:28). <b>Aren’t there Rav Naḥman’s daughters,</b> who were exceptionally righteous? <b>These words caused them to be taken captive,</b> due to the evil eye, <b>and</b> Rav Ilish <b>was also taken captive with them.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 8:1 | “Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [ pesher ] of the matter” | Berakhot 10a:26 | With regard to redemption and prayer, the Gemara tells the story of Hezekiah’s illness, his prayer to God, and subsequent recuperation. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> praising the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>“Who is like the wise man, and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of the matter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1)? This verse means: <b>Who is like the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who knows how to effect compromise [<i>peshara</i>] between two righteous individuals, between Hezekiah,</b> the king of Judea, <b>and Isaiah</b> the prophet. They disagreed over which of them should visit the other. <b>Hezekiah said: Let Isaiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Elijah</b> the prophet, <b>who went to Ahab,</b> the king of Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And Elijah went to appear to Ahab”</b> (I Kings 18:2). This proves that it is the prophet who must seek out the king. <b>And Isaiah said: Let Hezekiah come to me, as that is what we find with regard to Yehoram ben Ahab,</b> king of Israel, <b>who went to Elisha</b> the prophet, as it is stated: “So the king of Israel, Jehosaphat and the king of Edom went down to him” (II Kings 3:12). |
| Ecclesiastes 8:1 | “A man’s wisdom makes his face to shine” | Nedarim 49b:9 | The Gemara cites related incidents: <b>A certain</b> gentile <b>lady [<i>matronita</i>] said to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whose face was ruddy: How can one <b>teach</b> the Jews <b>and</b> be <b>a drunk</b> at the same time? <b>He said to her:</b> I place my <b>integrity in the hands of this woman</b> and should no longer be deemed credible <b>if I</b> ever <b>taste</b> any wine <b>except</b> for that of <b><i>kiddush</i>, <i>havdala</i>, and the four cups of Passover. And</b> after I drink those four cups <b>I tie my temples from Passover to <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> as wine gives me a headache. <b>Rather,</b> my complexion is explained by the verse <b>“A man’s wisdom makes his face to shine”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1). |
| Ecclesiastes 8:1 | “Who is as the wise man and who knows the interpretation [ pesher ] of a matter?” | Sotah 13b:24 | <b>And Shmuel says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Who is as the wise man and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of a matter?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1), referring to the greatness of Moses, who was able to forge compromises, <i>pesharim</i>, between God and the Jewish people. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Wisdom, where can it be found?”</b> (Job 28:12). <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“And Moses,</b> the servant of God, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Semalyon says</b> that God was saying: <b>And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died there.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 8:1 | Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “And the insolence of his face is changed” | Taanit 7b:9 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>any man who is insolent, it is permitted to call him wicked</b> to his face, <b>as it is stated: “A wicked man makes his face insolent”</b> (Proverbs 21:29). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “And the insolence of his face is changed”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“Is changed [<i>yeshunne</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Is hated [<i>yissane</i>],</b> as the two words are spelled the same way in Hebrew, albeit with different vocalization and pronunciation. |
| Ecclesiastes 8:4 | abrogate it, as it is stated: “For the word of the King has authority and who may say to Him: What do You do?” | Shabbat 63a:22 | <b>Rav Asi, and some say Rabbi Ḥanina said: Even if the Holy One, Blessed be He, issued a decree, He</b> may <b>abrogate it, as it is stated: “For the word of the King has authority and who may say to Him: What do You do?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:4). <b>And,</b> although this indicates that even though the King, God, issued a decree, <b>juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“He who guards the commandment shall know no evil thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:5). For one who observes mitzvot properly, the decree is abrogated and he will know no evil. |
| Ecclesiastes 8:5 | bad tidings, as it is stated: “He who keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing” | Shabbat 63a:21 | The Gemara continues in praise of those who perform mitzvot: <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi said: Anyone who performs a mitzva as it was commanded,</b> others <b>do not apprise him</b> of <b>bad tidings, as it is stated: “He who keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:5). |
| Ecclesiastes 8:5 | “He who guards the commandment shall know no evil thing” | Shabbat 63a:22 | <b>Rav Asi, and some say Rabbi Ḥanina said: Even if the Holy One, Blessed be He, issued a decree, He</b> may <b>abrogate it, as it is stated: “For the word of the King has authority and who may say to Him: What do You do?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:4). <b>And,</b> although this indicates that even though the King, God, issued a decree, <b>juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“He who guards the commandment shall know no evil thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:5). For one who observes mitzvot properly, the decree is abrogated and he will know no evil. |
| Ecclesiastes 8:10 | ” | Gittin 56b:11 | <b>What</b> else did Titus <b>do? He took the curtain and formed it like a large basket, and brought all of the</b> sacred <b>vessels of the Temple and placed them in it. And he put them on a ship to go and be praised in his city</b> that he had conquered Jerusalem, <b>as it is stated: “And so I saw the wicked buried, and come to their rest; but those that had done right were gone from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city;</b> this also is vanity<b>”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:10). <b>Do not read</b> the word <b>as “buried [<i>kevurim</i>].” Rather,</b> read it as <b>collected [<i>kevutzim</i>].</b> And <b>do not read</b> the word <b>as “and were forgotten [<i>veyishtakeḥu</i>].” Rather,</b> read it as: <b>And they were praised [<i>veyishtabeḥu</i>].</b> According to this interpretation, the verse speaks of those who will gather and collect items “from the holy place,” the Temple, and be praised in their city about what they had done. |
| Ecclesiastes 8:13 | Rabbi Elazar said: Any Torah scholar who does not stand before his teacher is called wicked, and he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as it is stated: “But it shall not be well for the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before [ millifnei ] God” | Kiddushin 33b:3 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Any Torah scholar who does not stand before his teacher is called wicked, and he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as it is stated: “But it shall not be well for the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before [<i>millifnei</i>] God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:13). <b>This fear</b> mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And you shall revere the face [<i>penei</i>] of an elder, <b>and you shall fear your God”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), one can deduce <b>that this fear</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>standing.</b> Consequently, this verse teaches with regard to one who does not stand that he is called wicked, he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as indicated by the phrase: “It shall not be well.” |
| Ecclesiastes 8:14 | which is written: “There is a vanity that is [ asher ] performed upon the earth; | Horayot 10b:4 | Apropos the homiletic interpretation of the term <i>asher</i>, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Ḥisda interpreted</b> a verse homiletically: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “There is a vanity that is [<i>asher</i>] performed upon the earth;</b> that there are [<i>asher</i>] righteous men to whom it happens according to [<i>asher</i>] the action of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the action of the righteous” (Ecclesiastes 8:14)? <b>Happy [<i>ashrei</i>] are the righteous, to whom it happens in this world according to the experiences of the wicked in the World-to-Come,</b> i.e., they suffer in this world. <b>Woe unto the wicked, to whom it happens in this world according to the experiences of the righteous in the World-to-Come,</b> i.e., they enjoy this world. |
| Ecclesiastes 8:15 | it is written: “So I commended mirth” | Shabbat 30b:4 | <b>And</b> to the essence of the matter, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Its statements</b> that <b>contradict each other? It is written: “Vexation is better than laughter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:3), <b>and it is written: “I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2), which is understood to mean that laughter is commendable. Likewise in one verse <b>it is written: “So I commended mirth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:15), <b>and</b> in another verse <b>it is written: “And of mirth: What does it accomplish?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:2). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the contradiction can be resolved. <b>Vexation is better than laughter</b> means: The <b>vexation</b> of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, toward the righteous in this world is preferable to the laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the wicked in this world</b> by showering them with goodness. <b>I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy, that is</b> the <b>laughter which the Holy One, Blessed be He, laughs with the righteous in the World-to-Come.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 9:2 | there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good | Shabbat 55b:1 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, why did You penalize Adam, the first man, with</b> the <b>death</b> penalty? <b>He said to them: I gave him a simple mitzva, and he violated it. They said to Him: Didn’t Moses and Aaron, who observed the whole Torah in its entirety,</b> nevertheless <b>die?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to them,</b> citing the verse: “All things come alike to all; <b>there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good</b> and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he who swears, as he who fears an oath” (Ecclesiastes 9:2). Apparently, death is not dependent upon one’s actions. Everyone dies. |
| Ecclesiastes 9:4 | And then again you said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion” | Shabbat 30a:3 | The Gemara relates: <b>This question was asked before Rabbi Tanḥum from</b> the village of <b>Nevi: What is</b> the ruling <b>with regard to extinguishing a burning lamp before a sick person on Shabbat?</b> The Gemara relates that Rabbi Tanḥum delivered an entire homily touching upon both aggadic and halakhic materials surrounding this question. <b>He began and said: You,</b> King <b>Solomon, where is your wisdom, where is your understanding? Not only do your statements contradict</b> the <b>statements of your father David, but your statements</b> even <b>contradict each other. Your father David said: “The dead praise not the Lord,</b> neither any that go down into silence” (Psalms 115:17); <b>and you said: “And I praised the dead that are already dead</b> more than the living that are yet alive” (Ecclesiastes 4:2). <b>And then again you said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:4). These are different assessments of life and death. |
| Ecclesiastes 9:4 | which Solomon said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion” | Shabbat 30a:9 | The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> that <b>which Solomon said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:4), <b>is in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What</b> is the meaning of that verse <b>which</b> David <b>said: “Lord, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am” (</b>Psalms 39:5)? It means that <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, Lord, make me to know my end;</b> in how long will I die? God <b>said to him: It is decreed before Me that</b> I do <b>not reveal the end of</b> the life of <b>flesh and blood.</b> He asked further: <b>And the measure of my days;</b> on <b>what</b> day of the year will I die? He said to him: <b>It is decreed before Me not to reveal the measure of a person’s days.</b> Again he requested: <b>Let me know how short-lived I am;</b> on what day of the week will I die? <b>He said to him: You will die on Shabbat.</b> David requested of God: <b>Let me die on the first</b> day <b>of the week</b> so that the honor of Shabbat will not be tarnished by the pain of death. <b>He said to him:</b> On that day <b>the</b> time of <b>the kingdom of your son Solomon has already arrived, and one kingdom does not overlap with another</b> and subtract from the time allotted to another <b>even a hairbreadth.</b> He said to him: <b>I will</b> cede a day of my life and <b>die on Shabbat eve.</b> God <b>said to him: “For a day in your courts is better than a thousand”</b> (Psalms 84:11); <b>a single day in which you sit and engage in Torah is preferable to Me than the thousand burnt-offerings that your son Solomon will offer before Me on the altar</b> (see I Kings 3:4). |
| Ecclesiastes 9:5 | know so much? Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing” | Berakhot 18a:14 | Rabbi Yonatan <b>said to him: Do</b> the dead <b>know so much? Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If you read</b> the verse, <b>you did not</b> read it <b>a second time, and if you</b> read it <b>a second time, you did not</b> read it <b>a third time, and if you</b> read it <b>a third time, they did not explain it to you</b> properly. The meaning of the verse: “For the living know that they will die, and the dead know nothing and have no more reward, for their memory has been forgotten” (Ecclesiastes 9:5): <b>For the living know that they will die, these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.</b> An allusion to this is <b>as it is stated: “And Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, son of a valiant man of Kabze’el, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow”</b> (II Samuel 23:20). |
| Ecclesiastes 9:6 | “Their love as well as their hatred and their envy is long ago perished” | Horayot 14a:2 | His son <b>said to him,</b> citing the verse: <b>“Their love as well as their hatred and their envy is long ago perished”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:6): That was long ago and they have already died. Therefore, there is no harm in mentioning their names. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> But it is also stated: <b>“The enemy are come to an end; the wasted places are forever”</b> (Psalms 9:7). Although the enemies died, the desolation that they created remains. Therefore, although they are dead, their names should not be mentioned. Rabban Shimon <b>said to</b> his father: <b>These matters</b> apply in a case <b>where their actions were effective.</b> In the case of these <b>Sages, their actions were not effective.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>then taught him:</b> The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Meir: If it was</b> considered <b>a substitute, it would not be sacrificed. Rava said: Even Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who is humble, taught:</b> The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Meir.</b> But <b>he did not say</b> directly: <b>Rabbi Meir said.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 9:7 | “Go your way, eat your bread with joy, | Berakhot 56a:5 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“Go your way, eat your bread with joy,</b> and drink your wine with a merry heart” (Ecclesiastes 9:7) <b>was read to us in our dream. To Abaye he said: Your business will profit and you will eat and drink and read the verse out of the joy of your heart. To Rava he said: Your business will be lost, you will slaughter but not eat, you will drink</b> wine and <b>read</b> passages from the Bible in order <b>to allay your fears.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 9:8 | Solomon also said in his wisdom: “At all times your clothes should be white, and oil shall not be absent from upon your head” | Shabbat 153a:5 | <b>We learned there</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Repent one day before your death. Rabbi Eliezer’s students asked him: But does a person know the day</b> on which <b>he will die? He said to them: All the more so</b> this is a good piece of advice, and <b>one should repent today lest he die tomorrow; and</b> by following this advice <b>one will spend his entire life in</b> a state of <b>repentance. And</b> King <b>Solomon also said in his wisdom: “At all times your clothes should be white, and oil shall not be absent from upon your head”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:8), meaning that a person always needs to be prepared. |
| Ecclesiastes 9:9 | Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “Enjoy life with the wife whom you love” | Kiddushin 30b:11 | § The <i>baraita</i> further states that a father is commanded <b>to teach</b> his son <b>a trade.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “Enjoy life with the wife whom you love”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:9). <b>If</b> this verse is interpreted literally, and <b>it</b> is referring to <b>an actual woman,</b> then one can derive as follows: <b>Just as</b> a father <b>is obligated to marry</b> his son <b>to a woman, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade,</b> as indicated by the term: Life. <b>And if</b> the wife mentioned in this verse is allegorical, and <b>it is the Torah,</b> then one should explain the verse in the following manner: <b>Just as he is obligated to teach him Torah, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 9:12 | which is written: “For man also knows not his time, like fish snared in an evil net” | Sanhedrin 81b:12 | The Gemara cites a related statement. <b>And Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For man also knows not his time, like fish snared in an evil net”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:12)? <b>What</b> is the nature of this <b>evil net? Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>a hook;</b> although it is small and the fish is much larger, the fish cannot escape it. |
| Ecclesiastes 9:18 | to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good” | Kiddushin 40b:1 | <b>a person should view himself as though he were</b> exactly <b>half-liable and half-meritorious.</b> In other words he should act as though the plates of his scale are balanced, so that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is fortunate, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of merit.</b> If <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:18), which means that <b>due to one sin that</b> a person <b>transgresses he squanders much good.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:1 | Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid” | Berakhot 61a:27 | <b>Rav said: The evil inclination is like a fly and it sits between the two entrances of the heart, as it is stated: “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:1). <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The evil inclination <b>is like a type of wheat, as it is stated: “Transgression [<i>ḥatat</i>] couches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7); <i>ḥatat</i> is interpreted homiletically as related to <i>ḥitta</i>, wheat. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:2 | evil is to his left, as it is written: “A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand, but a fool’s understanding is at his left” | Berakhot 61a:28 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person has two kidneys; one advises him to</b> do <b>good and one advises him to</b> do <b>evil. And it stands to reason</b> that the one advising him to do <b>good is to his right and</b> the one that advises him to do <b>evil is to his left, as it is written: “A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand, but a fool’s understanding is at his left”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:2). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:2 | “A wise heart to his right and a foolish heart to his left” | Shabbat 90b:4 | We learned in the mishna: With regard to carrying out the locust called <b><i>tzipporet keramim</i>, whether dead or alive,</b> the measure for liability is <b>any amount.</b> This is because one stores them for medicinal purposes or as a talisman, which renders even one locust significant. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>tzipporet keramim</i>? Rav said:</b> It is the locust called <b><i>palya biari</i>. Abaye said: And</b> it can be <b>found in a palm tree that</b> has only <b>one vine, and it is used</b> as a talisman <b>for wisdom.</b> One <b>eats its right half,</b> and <b>casts its left half into a copper tube, and seals it with sixty seals, and hangs it on his left arm. And</b> the <b>mnemonic</b> reminding <b>you</b> which half to eat and which half to hang on the arm is the verse: <b>“A wise heart to his right and a foolish heart to his left”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:2). <b>And one</b> then <b>grows wise as much as he wants, and studies as much as he wants, and</b> then <b>eats the other half, as if</b> he does <b>not</b> do so, <b>his learning</b> will <b>be forgotten.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:5 | was “like an error that proceeds from a ruler” | Bava Metzia68a:8 | <b>Mar, son of Ameimar, said to Rav Ashi: Father would do so,</b> i.e., he would add the profits to the sum of the loan contract, <b>and when they came before him</b> and told him they had not earned enough profit <b>he would believe them</b> and reduce the debt to the amount they had actually earned. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This <b>works out well while</b> the lender <b>is</b> still <b>here,</b> but <b>if he dies and the document comes before the orphans, what</b> would happen in that case? Unaware that profits have been added to the document, the orphans would demand the entire sum, which would constitute interest. The Gemara comments: This innocent observation of Rav Ashi’s <b>was “like an error that proceeds from a ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5), <b>and Ameimar died</b> shortly afterward. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:5 | was “Like an error that emerges from before the ruler” | Ketubot 23a:15 | The statement by the father of Shmuel <b>was “Like an error that emerges from before the ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5), <b>and</b> it was realized. <b>The daughters of Master Shmuel were taken captive, and</b> their captors <b>took them up to Eretz Yisrael</b> and sought to sell them or ransom them. Shmuel’s daughters left <b>their captors standing outside,</b> so that they would not come before the court, <b>and</b> the women <b>entered the study hall of Rabbi Ḥanina. This</b> daughter <b>said: I was taken captive, and I am pure, and that</b> daughter <b>said: I was taken captive, and I am pure, and</b> the court <b>permitted them</b> to marry into the priesthood. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:5 | became “like an error that proceeds from a ruler” | Ketubot 62b:6 | It is related further that <b>Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and <b>son-in-law of Rabbi Yannai, would go and sit in the study hall, and every</b> Shabbat eve <b>at twilight he would come to his house. When he would come,</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>would see a pillar of fire preceding him</b> due to his sanctity. <b>One day he was engrossed in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> he was studying, and he stayed in the study hall and did not return home. <b>When Rabbi Yannai did not see that sign</b> preceding him, <b>he said to</b> the family: <b>Turn his bed over,</b> as one does at times of mourning, since he must have died, reasoning that <b>if Yehuda were alive he would not have missed his set interval</b> for conjugal relations and would certainly have come home. What he said <b>became “like an error that proceeds from a ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5), <b>and</b> Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>died.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:5 | were: “Like an error that proceeds from a ruler” | Moed Katan18a:3 | Pineḥas’s words <b>were: “Like an error that proceeds from a ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5). As soon as he uttered them they come true, even though he did not intend them. Shortly after Pineḥas made his comment, <b>something</b> unpleasant <b>happened to Shmuel,</b> and one of his close relatives died. <b>Pineḥas, his brother, entered to ask him the reason,</b> i.e., to offer words of comfort. Shmuel <b>took his nails and cast them in</b> Pineḥas’s face. Shmuel then <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you not</b> know the principle that <b>a covenant is made with the lips?</b> In other words, do you not know that what one says influences future events? |
| Ecclesiastes 10:8 | “And who breaks through a fence, a snake shall bite him” | Avodah Zarah27b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael recited with regard to him: Fortunate are you, ben Dama, as your body is pure and your soul departed in purity, and you did not transgress the statement of your colleagues, who would state</b> the verse: <b>“And who breaks through a fence, a snake shall bite him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:8), i.e., one is punished for ignoring an ordinance of the Sages. This incident indicates that it is not permitted for one to accept medical treatment from a heretic even if it is clear that without it he will live only a short while. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:8 | death | Eruvin 21b:8 | <b>Rava expounded</b> another verse in similar fashion: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [<i>sefarim</i>]</b> there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? <b>My son, be careful</b> to fulfill <b>the words of the Sages [<i>soferim</i>]</b> even <b>more than the words of the Torah. For the words of the Torah include positive and negative</b> commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. <b>Whereas</b> with respect to <b>the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the words of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:8 | one who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake | Shabbat 110a:1 | Jewish <b>official</b> in <b>Pumbedita that was bitten by a snake. There were thirteen white donkeys in Pumbedita</b> and <b>they tore them all</b> open <b>and they were found to be <i>tereifot</i>. There was one</b> donkey <b>on the other side</b> of <b>Pumbedita,</b> and <b>until they went to bring it, a lion ate it. Abaye said to them:</b> Since all of these things have happened, <b>perhaps a snake of the Rabbis bit him, for which there is no cure, as it is written:</b> “One that digs a pit will fall into it, and <b>one who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake</b>” (Ecclesiastes 10:8). Perhaps this person violated a rabbinic decree, also known as a fence, and was bitten by a snake as punishment. That bite has no cure. <b>They said to him: Yes, my teacher,</b> it is so, <b>as when Rav died Rav Yitzḥak bar Bisna ruled that one may not bring myrtle and</b> palm <b>branches to a wedding hall to</b> accompany <b>bells, and he went</b> and <b>brought myrtle and</b> palm <b>branches to the wedding hall with bells.</b> Therefore, <b>a snake bit him. And</b> it is reported that ultimately the official <b>died.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:9 | which is written: “He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them; and he that chops wood shall be warmed thereby” | Bava Batra145b:10 | <b>Rava says: The opposite</b> is true. <b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them; and he that chops wood shall be warmed thereby”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:9). <b>“He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them”; these are the masters of Mishna.</b> They exert themselves to memorize the <i>mishnayot</i>, but since one cannot reach practical conclusions from the mishna, they are comparable to one who carries a heavy load without benefiting from it. <b>“He that chops wood shall be warmed thereby”; these are the masters of Talmud,</b> who attain the benefit of their exertions in the form of practical conclusions. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:9 | which is written: “One who quarries stones shall be saddened by them | Sanhedrin 100b:14 | <b>Rava says</b> that <b>the opposite</b> is true; <b>and this is</b> that <b>which Rav Mesharshiyya said in the name of Rava: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “One who quarries stones shall be saddened by them</b> and he who chops wood shall be warmed by it” (Ecclesiastes 10:9)? “One who quarries stones shall be saddened by them”; <b>these are masters of the Mishna,</b> as they invest effort, but are unable to benefit from that effort, as they do not reach halakhic conclusions. <b>“And he who chops wood shall be warmed by it”; these are masters of the Talmud,</b> who invest considerable effort and benefit from it, as they reach halakhic conclusions. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:10 | which is written: “If the iron is blunt, and does not whet the edge” | Taanit 7b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the iron is blunt, and does not whet the edge”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10)? <b>If you see a sky that is blunt as iron, in that</b> it does not <b>bring down dew and rain,</b> this is <b>due to</b> the <b>deeds of the generation, which are corrupt, as it is stated: “And does not whet [<i>kilkal</i>] the edge [<i>panim</i>].”</b> <i>Panim</i>, which also means face, is often used in reference to the leaders of a generation, while the term <i>kilkal</i> is similar to the word for corrupt, <i>mekulkalin</i>. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:10 | “Then must he increase his strength, but wisdom is profitable to direct” | Taanit 7b:15 | <b>What is their remedy? They</b> must <b>increase</b> their prayers <b>for mercy, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“Then must he increase his strength, but wisdom is profitable to direct”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). This verse hints that rain will fall if one increases his strength, i.e., his prayers for mercy. The last part of the verse means that, <b>all the more so, if their deeds</b> had been righteous and <b>direct from the beginning,</b> the rains would not have been withheld. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:10 | as it is stated: “And does not whet [ kilkal ] the edge [ panim ]” | Taanit 8a:1 | <b>whose studies are hard as iron for him,</b> i.e., difficult to understand, this is <b>due to his</b> lack of familiarity with the <b>Mishna, which is not organized for him.</b> If the Mishna is unclear, any further study of Gemara is rendered all the more difficult, <b>as it is stated: “And does not whet [<i>kilkal</i>] the edge [<i>panim</i>]”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). As panim can also mean surface, this indicates that the surface, i.e., the basic statements of the Mishna, is corrupted. As stated previously, <i>kilkal</i> can also mean corrupted. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:10 | as it is stated: “Then must he increase his strength” | Taanit 8a:2 | <b>What is his remedy?</b> He must <b>increase</b> the time he <b>sits</b> and studies, <b>as it is stated: “Then must he increase his strength”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). The last part of the verse: <b>“But wisdom is profitable to direct,”</b> means that <b>all the more so, if his</b> study of the <b>Mishna is organized for him from the beginning,</b> he will avoid this trouble. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:10 | as it is stated: “And it has not whetted the surface [ panim ]” | Taanit 8a:4 | With regard to the aforementioned verse from Ecclesiastes, <b>Rava said: If you see a student whose studies are</b> as <b>difficult for him as iron,</b> this is <b>due to his teacher, who does not show him a friendly countenance,</b> but is overly strict with him. This practice inhibits the student’s learning, <b>as it is stated: “And it has not whetted the surface [<i>panim</i>]”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). As explained previously, <i>panim</i> can also mean countenance. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:11 | which is written: “If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then what advantage is there to the master of the tongue” | Arakhin 15b:10 | <b>And Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then what advantage is there to the master of the tongue”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11). What is the connection between the serpent and the master of the tongue? <b>In the future, all the animals</b> will <b>gather and come to the serpent and</b> will <b>say</b> to it: <b>A lion tramples</b> with its paws to kill its prey <b>and eats; a wolf tears</b> with its teeth to kill its prey <b>and eats.</b> But <b>you, what benefit do you have</b> when you bite, as you cannot eat every animal that you kill? The serpent will <b>say to them: And what is the benefit to the master of the tongue</b> that speaks malicious speech? |
| Ecclesiastes 10:11 | which is written: “If the snake bites before it is charmed, then the charmer has no advantage” | Taanit 8a:11 | The Gemara cites another interpretation of the aforementioned verse. <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the snake bites before it is charmed, then the charmer has no advantage”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11)? <b>In the future, all the animals will gather together and come to the snake and say to him: A lion mauls</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it; <b>a wolf tears apart</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it; but <b>you, what pleasure do you have</b> when you bite a person, as you are incapable of eating him? The snake will <b>say to them: “The charmer has no advantage.”</b> The Hebrew phrase for snake charmer literally means the master of the tongue, and therefore the snake is saying that he has a more difficult question: What pleasure does a slanderer receive, as he inflicts more harm for which he obtains no physical enjoyment. |
| Ecclesiastes 10:11 | which is written: “If the serpent [ naḥash ] bites [ yishokh ] before it is charmed [ laḥash ], then the charmer has no advantage” | Taanit 8a:6 | § The Gemara returns to the topic of rain. <b>And Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the serpent [<i>naḥash</i>] bites [<i>yishokh</i>] before it is charmed [<i>laḥash</i>], then the charmer has no advantage”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11)? <b>If you see a generation</b> for whom <b>the heavens corrode [<i>meshatkhin</i>] like copper [<i>neḥoshet</i>],</b> which prevents them <b>from bringing down dew and rain,</b> this is <b>due to the lack of those who whisper quiet [<i>loḥashei leḥishot</i>]</b> prayers <b>in the generation.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 10:18 | Rabbi Elazar introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Through laziness the rafters [ hamekare ] sink in [ yimakh ]; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” | Megillah 11a:6 | <b>Rabbi Elazar introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Through laziness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] sink in [<i>yimakh</i>]; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:18). Rabbi Elazar interprets the verse homiletically: <b>Through the laziness of the Jewish people, who did not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, <b>became poor [<i>makh</i>],</b> so that, as it were, He was unable to help them, <b>as <i>makh</i></b> is <b>nothing other than poor, as it is stated: “But if he be too poor [<i>makh</i>] for the valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And</b> the word <b><i>mekare</i></b> in the verse <b>is referring</b> to <b>no</b> one <b>other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of His chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:18 | “By laziness the rafters sink in; | Sanhedrin 7a:12 | There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was saying as he walked:</b> If a woman is carrying a basket on her head, when <b>she is dozing the reed basket falls. Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: A verse</b> is <b>written</b> that conveys the message of this aphorism: <b>“By laziness the rafters sink in;</b> and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:18 | Torah, as it is stated: “By slothfulness the rafters [ hamekare ] will sink in [ yimakh ], | Taanit 7b:10 | <b>Rav Ketina said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated: “By slothfulness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] will sink in [<i>yimakh</i>],</b> and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18). <b>Due to slothfulness that was</b> present <b>amongst the Jewish people, that they did not occupy</b> themselves <b>with Torah, the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, has <b>sunk. And sunk [<i>makh</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>poor, as it is stated: “But if he is too poor [<i>makh</i>] for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And “rafters [<i>mekare</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than a reference to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of Your upper chambers in the water”</b> (Psalms 104:3). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:20 | for a bird of the air shall carry the voice” | Avodah Zarah10b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him say</b> his advice <b>explicitly?</b> Why did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answer in such a circumspect way, which could have been interpreted incorrectly? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> to himself: If I answer openly, <b>the important Romans</b> might <b>hear me and will cause</b> me <b>anguish.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him say</b> his advice <b>quietly?</b> The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was still worried that they might hear what he had said, <b>because it is written:</b> “Curse not the king, no, not in your thought, and curse not the rich in your bedchamber, <b>for a bird of the air shall carry the voice”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:20 | it is written: “Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts” | Bava Batra4a:1 | Herod <b>placed a garland</b> made <b>of porcupine</b> hide <b>on</b> Bava ben Buta’s head, which <b>pricked his eyes out. One day</b> Herod <b>came and sat before him</b> without identifying himself in order to test him. <b>He,</b> Herod, <b>said: See, Master, what this evil slave</b> Herod <b>is doing.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: What should I do to him?</b> Herod <b>said to him:</b> The <b>Master should curse him.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> But <b>it is written: “Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). Herod <b>said to him: He is not a king,</b> since he rules illegally. Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: And</b> even if <b>he were merely a rich man</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And do not curse a rich person in your bedchamber”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). <b>And</b> even <b>were he only a leader</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And you shall not curse a leader among your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27). |
| Ecclesiastes 10:20 | it is written: “For a bird of the sky shall carry the sound, and that which has wings shall tell the matter” | Bava Batra4a:2 | Herod <b>said to him:</b> That <i>halakha</i> stated <b>with regard to</b> “a leader among your people,” that is, to a fit Jew who <b>acts as</b> a member of <b>your people,</b> i.e., in accordance with Torah law, <b>and this one does not do the deeds of your people.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> Nevertheless, <b>I am afraid of him.</b> Herod <b>said to him: There is nobody who will go and tell him, since you and I are sitting</b> here alone.

| Ecclesiastes 11:2 | “Give a portion to seven, and also to eight” | Eruvin 40b:9 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Give a portion to seven, and also to eight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:2). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “Seven,” these are the seven days of Creation; “eight,” these are the eight days</b> until <b>circumcision. Rabbi Yehoshua says: “Seven,” these are the seven days of Passover; “eight,” these are the eight days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And when it says: “And also,”</b> like every other instance of the word “also” in the Torah, this comes <b>to include;</b> what it includes is <b><i>Shavuot</i>, and Rosh HaShana, and Yom Kippur.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 11:3 | about him: “Where the tree falls, there it shall be” | Avodah Zarah31a:4 | Upon hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “Where the tree falls, there it shall be”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:3). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that this means that the tree itself <b>will be there?</b> It is obvious that a fallen tree lands where it falls. <b>Rather,</b> the verse is saying: <b>There its fruits shall be.</b> The verse is a metaphor for a Sage, and its fruits represent his disciples. Rabbi Yoḥanan was intimating that although bar Kappara may have died, Rabbi Tanḥum, his disciple, perpetuates his wisdom. |
| Ecclesiastes 11:6 | children in his old age, as it is stated: “In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good” | Yevamot 62b:8 | § The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it is taught in a</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If <b>a man married a woman in his youth,</b> and she passed away, <b>he should marry</b> another <b>woman in his old age.</b> If <b>he had children in his youth, he should have</b> more <b>children in his old age, as it is stated: “In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:6). This verse indicates that a man should continue having children even after he has fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. |
| Ecclesiastes 11:9 | that which is written: “Rejoice young man in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment” | Shabbat 63b:3 | On a related note, <b>Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Rejoice young man in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:9)? <b>Until here,</b> “the sight of your eyes,” these are <b>the words of the evil inclination; from here on,</b> “but know that, etc.,” these are <b>the words of the good inclination.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 11:10 | as it is stated: “Therefore remove vexation from your heart and put away evil from your flesh” | Nedarim 22a:9 | § Apropos the verse “There the wicked cease from troubling,” the Gemara cites a related statement: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who gets angry, all kinds of Gehenna rule over him,</b> because anger causes him to transgress all kinds of severe sins, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore remove vexation from your heart and put away evil from your flesh”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:10), <b>and the evil</b> mentioned <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), which is interpreted to mean that ultimately the day of the evildoer in Gehenna will arrive. |
| Ecclesiastes 11:10 | that which is written: “For childhood and youth [ shaḥarut ] are vanity” | Shabbat 152a:14 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For childhood and youth [<i>shaḥarut</i>] are vanity”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:10)? Sinful <b>things that a person does in his youth darken [<i>mashḥirim</i>] his face</b> with shame <b>as he grows old</b> (Rabbi Yoshiya Pinto). |
| Ecclesiastes 11:10 | Ravina said: And even so, one is required to teach himself to act gently, as it is stated: “And remove anger from your heart, | Taanit 4a:3 | <b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: You learned</b> the proof for this idea <b>from</b> that verse <b>there; we learned it from here, as it is written: “A land whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>] are iron”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>],” rather,</b> read it as <b>whose builders [<i>boneha</i>],</b> since Torah scholars build the land spiritually and are as tough as iron. With regard to these statements praising the toughness of a Torah scholar, <b>Ravina said: And even so, one is required to teach himself to act gently, as it is stated: “And remove anger from your heart,</b> and put away evil from your flesh” (Ecclesiastes 11:10). |
| Ecclesiastes 12:1 | Solomon also said, in his wisdom: “And remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come | Shabbat 151b:11 | <b>It was</b> also <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the appreciation of life: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Perform</b> mitzvot <b>while you</b> still <b>find</b> opportunities, <b>and you have</b> the financial means, <b>and you are still under your</b> own <b>control. And</b> King <b>Solomon also said, in his wisdom: “And remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come</b> and the years arrive when you will say: I have no desire for them” (Ecclesiastes 12:1). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar explains: “The evil days”; <b>these are the days of old age. “And the years arrive when you will say: I have no desire for them”; these are the days of Messiah, in which there is neither merit nor liability.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 12:2 | are darkened, | Shabbat 151b:15 | The Gemara returns to verses from Ecclesiastes that relate to death and old age. It is written: <b>“Before the sun and the light</b> and the moon and the stars <b>are darkened,</b> and the clouds return after the rain” (Ecclesiastes 12:2). The Sages taught: “The sun and the light”; <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the forehead and the nose</b> which stick out from a person’s face. <b>“And the moon”; this</b> is referring to <b>the soul,</b> which shines within a person. <b>“And the stars”; these are the cheeks. “And the clouds return after the rain”; this is the light of a person’s eyes, which goes</b> and dwindles <b>after one cries</b> as if it were covered by clouds. <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>the tear</b> that a person cries, <b>until</b> one reaches the age of <b>forty years, one’s vision returns</b> and is not harmed. <b>From here on,</b> once a person reaches the age of forty, <b>it does not return,</b> and every time a person cries his vision is weakened. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:3 | shall bow themselves, | Shabbat 152a:2 | The Gemara continues to interpret verses from the Book of Ecclesiastes. The verse states: <b>“On the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,</b> and the strong men <b>shall bow themselves,</b> and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out the windows shall be dimmed” (Ecclesiastes 12:3). <b>“On the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble”; this</b> is referring to <b>the flanks and ribs</b> that surround and protect a person’s internal organs. <b>“And the strong men shall bow themselves”; these are the thighs,</b> which support a person’s strength. <b>“And the grinders cease”; these are the teeth,</b> which decay and fall out. <b>“And those that look out the windows shall be dimmed”; these are the eyes,</b> which become dimmer. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:5 | “For a person goes to his eternal home” | Shabbat 152a:13 | The Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse cited above: <b>“For a person goes to his eternal home”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:5). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This teaches that each and every righteous person is given a dwelling place</b> in the World-to-Come <b>in accordance with his honor.</b> The Gemara offers <b>a parable</b> in which <b>a king enters a city along with his servants. When they enter, they all enter through a single gate;</b> however, <b>when they sleep, each one is given a dwelling place in accordance with his honor.</b> So too, although everyone dies, not everyone receives the same reward in the World-to-Come. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:5 | “And the eulogizers walk about the marketplace” | Shabbat 153a:4 | <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma</b> before <b>Rav: Which</b> type of person <b>has a share in the World-to-Come?</b> He <b>said to him:</b> We can derive this from the verse: <b>“And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying: This is the path, walk on it, when you turn to the right or to the left”</b> (Isaiah 30:21). In other words, if people eulogize one by saying that others should follow in his path, he must have a share in the World-to-Come. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone with whom our Rabbis are pleased</b> has a share in the World-to-Come. In interpreting the verse: <b>“And the eulogizers walk about the marketplace”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:5), <b>the people of the Galilee say: Do things</b> that you will want people to say at your eulogy <b>in front of your bier. The people of Judea say: Do things</b> that you want people to say at your eulogy <b>behind your bier.</b> The Gemara remarks: <b>And they do not disagree;</b> this <b>Sage</b> expressed it according to the norm <b>in his place, and</b> this <b>Sage</b> expressed it differently according to the norm <b>in his place.</b> The custom in the Galilee was that the eulogizers would stand before the bier and the custom in Judea was that eulogizers would stand behind the bier. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:6 | Solomon also said in his wisdom | Shabbat 151b:4 | <b>And</b> King <b>Solomon also said in his wisdom</b> with regard to old age and death: “Before the silver cord is snapped asunder, and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel falls, shattered, into the pit” (Ecclesiastes 12:6), which the Gemara explains as follows: <b>“Before the silver cord is snapped asunder”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the spinal cord. “And the golden bowl [<i>gullat</i>] is shattered”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the member,</b> which is like a spring of water [<i>gulla</i>]. <b>“And the pitcher is broken at the fountain”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the stomach,</b> which looks like a pitcher that swells and ruptures. <b>“And the wheel [<i>galgal</i>] falls, shattered, into the pit”; this is</b> a reference to <b>excrement</b> [<i>gelalim</i>]. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:7 | “And the dust returns to the earth as it was, | Shabbat 152b:3 | <b>The one who said</b> that it is <b>until the flesh decomposes</b> can support his position based on that <b>which is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“But his flesh grieves for him, and his soul mourns over him”</b> (Job 14:22). This indicates that the deceased is aware of the pain of his flesh in the grave. <b>The one</b> who <b>said</b> that the deceased is aware only <b>until</b> the tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the top-stone</b> can support his view based on that <b>which is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“And the dust returns to the earth as it was,</b> and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7). This indicates that when the body returns to the earth, the spirit also returns to its place and is no longer aware of what is happening to the body. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:7 | “And the spirit returns to God who gave it” | Shabbat 152b:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the spirit returns to God who gave it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7) that the words: Who gave it, mean: As it was given. In other words, <b>give it to Him as He gave it to you;</b> just as He gave it to you <b>in purity, you too</b> should return it to God <b>in purity.</b> The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a king of flesh and blood who distributed royal garments to his servants. The wise ones folded them and placed them in a box [<i>kufsa</i>]</b> to protect them, whereas <b>the foolish ones went and worked in them.</b> After <b>a period of time the king requested</b> that <b>his garments</b> be returned to him. The <b>wise ones returned them to him pressed,</b> as they were when the servants received them, and <b>the foolish ones returned them dirty. The king was happy to greet the wise ones and angry to greet the foolish ones.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 12:7 | become dust, as it is written: “And the dust returns to the earth as it was” | Shabbat 152b:8 | <b>Rabba said to Rav Naḥman: What</b> happens to the souls <b>of middling people,</b> who are neither righteous nor wicked? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> It is good that you asked me this question, for even <b>if I were dead I would not</b> have been able <b>to tell you</b> that. As <b>Shmuel said as follows: These and those,</b> the souls of the wicked and of the middling people, <b>are handed over to Duma,</b> the angel in charge of spirits. But <b>these,</b> the souls of the middling people, <b>have rest, and these,</b> the souls of the wicked, <b>do not have rest. Rav Mari said:</b> Even the bodies of <b>the righteous will</b> not be preserved and will <b>become dust, as it is written: “And the dust returns to the earth as it was”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7). |
| Ecclesiastes 12:7 | verse which is written: “And the dust will return to the earth as it was” | Shabbat 152b:9 | The Gemara cites a related story: <b>The diggers who were digging in Rav Naḥman’s land</b> came upon a grave, and <b>Rav Aḥai bar Yoshiya,</b> who was buried there, <b>rebuked them. They came and said to Rav Naḥman: A</b> deceased <b>person</b> just <b>rebuked us.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>came and said to</b> the person buried there: <b>Who is the Master,</b> i.e., who are you? He <b>said to him: I am Aḥai bar Yoshiya.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> How has your body been preserved? <b>Didn’t Rav Mari say</b> that <b>the righteous will turn to dust?</b> Rav Aḥai <b>said to him: And who is Mari, whom I do not know?</b> Why should I be concerned about what he says? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Even without Rav Mari’s statement, <b>there is an</b> explicit <b>verse which is written: “And the dust will return to the earth as it was”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7). |
| Ecclesiastes 12:9 | which is written: “And besides being wise, Koheleth also taught the people knowledge; and he weighed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs” | Eruvin 21b:22 | <b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And besides being wise, Koheleth also taught the people knowledge; and he weighed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:9). Rava interpreted homiletically: <b>He taught the people knowledge,</b> meaning <b>he taught it with the accentuation marks</b> in the Torah, <b>and</b> he <b>explained</b> each matter <b>by means of</b> something <b>similar to it.</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 12:9 | “He weighed [ izzen ] and sought out, and set in order many proverbs” | Yevamot 21a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that the prohibition of secondary forbidden relationships is learned <b>from here:</b> As it says with regard to King Solomon: <b>“He weighed [<i>izzen</i>] and sought out, and set in order many proverbs”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:9), <b>and Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Before Solomon came, the Torah was like a basket [<i>kefifa</i>] without handles [<i>oznayim</i>], until Solomon came and made handles for it.</b> By means of his explanation and proverbs he enabled each person to understand and take hold of the Torah, fulfill its mitzvot, and distance himself from transgressions. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:10 | “Kohelet sought to find out words of delight” | Rosh Hashanah21b:12 | <b>“Kohelet sought to find out words of delight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10), which indicates that he sought to find the fiftieth gate but failed to do so. <b>Kohelet,</b> King Solomon, <b>sought to be like Moses,</b> but <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10). This is referring to the words of the Torah; and what is written there? <b>“And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,</b> whom the Lord knew face-to-face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). |
| Ecclesiastes 12:11 | “The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are those that are composed in collections; they are given from one shepherd” | Chagigah 3b:2 | The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>also commenced</b> his lecture <b>and taught:</b> It is written: <b>“The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are those that are composed in collections; they are given from one shepherd”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:11). <b>Why are matters of Torah compared to a goad? To tell you</b> that <b>just as this goad directs the cow to her furrow to bring forth</b> sustenance for <b>life to the world, so too the words of Torah direct those who study them from the paths of death to the paths of life.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> derive the following from that same analogy: <b>Just as this goad is movable</b> and not rigid, <b>so too matters of Torah are movable</b> in accordance with circumstance and are not permanent. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Nails,”</b> which are permanent. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:12 | which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [ sefarim ] | Eruvin 21b:8 | <b>Rava expounded</b> another verse in similar fashion: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [<i>sefarim</i>]</b> there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? <b>My son, be careful</b> to fulfill <b>the words of the Sages [<i>soferim</i>]</b> even <b>more than the words of the Torah. For the words of the Torah include positive and negative</b> commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. <b>Whereas</b> with respect to <b>the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the words of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees. |
| Ecclesiastes 12:13 | Rav Huna said: Any person who has the fear of Heaven, his words are heeded, as it is stated: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God, | Berakhot 6b:34 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Any person who has the fear of Heaven, his words are heeded, as it is stated: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God,</b> and keep His commandments; for this is all of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). The Gemara explains: “The end of the matter, all having been heard,” refers to the words of one “who keeps His commandments; for this is all of man.” |
| Ecclesiastes 12:14 | when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “For God shall bring every work into the judgment concerning every hidden thing” | Chagigah 5a:10 | Additionally, <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “For God shall bring every work into the judgment concerning every hidden thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:14). He said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master weighs his unwitting</b> sins <b>like intentional</b> ones, i.e., God punishes him even for an action that was hidden from him, <b>is there a remedy for him?</b> |
| Ecclesiastes 12:14 | “Whether it be good, or whether it be evil” | Chagigah 5a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“Whether it be good, or whether it be evil”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:14)? This verse indicates that God judges man harshly even for the good deeds he performs. The Sages <b>from the school of Rabbi Yannai say: This</b> verse is referring to <b>one who gives charity to a poor person in public.</b> Although he performed a good deed, he embarrassed the pauper, <b>as in this</b> case <b>of Rabbi Yannai,</b> who <b>saw a certain man who was giving a dinar to a poor person in public. He said to him:</b> It would have been <b>better had you not given</b> it <b>to him than</b> what you did, as <b>now you gave</b> it to <b>him and embarrassed him.</b> |
