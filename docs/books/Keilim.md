| Keilim 25:6 | As we learned | Chagigah 22b:15 | The Gemara explains. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Keilim</i> 25:6): <b>A vessel whose back</b> part, as opposed to its inside, <b>was defiled by</b> contact with impure <b>liquid. Its back is impure,</b> while its other parts, such as <b>its inside, its rim, its ear-shaped handles, and its</b> straight <b>handles are pure.</b> By Torah law, foods and liquids cannot impart ritual impurity to a vessel at all, but by rabbinic law liquids can. In order to clarify that it is only a rabbinic decree, they instituted that the impurity thereby imparted, if the liquid touched the outside of the vessel, should affect only the part touched by the liquid, but not its inside or the other parts of its outside. However, if <b>its inside was defiled,</b> even by impurity only according to rabbinic law, <b>it is all impure.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies only to <i>teruma</i>, but regarding offerings, the defilement of any part of the vessel renders it all impure. |
