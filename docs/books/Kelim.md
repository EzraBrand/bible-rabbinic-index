| Kelim 1:1 | With regard to ritual impurities, we learned | Bava Kamma2a:10 | <b>With regard to ritual impurities, we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 1:1): <b>The primary categories of ritual impurity</b> are as follows: Any of the eight species of <b>the creeping animal</b> enumerated in the Torah (Leviticus 11:29–30), <b>and semen,</b> |
| Kelim 1:3 | as we learned | Bava Kamma25a:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says there</b> that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying <b>only because it is impossible</b> for semen to emerge <b>without small drops of <i>ziva</i></b> accompanying it. This indicates that <b>if not for this</b> reason, the semen would <b>not</b> impart ritual impurity by carrying, according to the opinions of both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>this <i>tanna</i> is</b> the one who holds the opinion that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna listing the sources of ritual impurity (<i>Kelim</i> 1:3): <b>Of a greater degree than</b> the ritual impurities listed previously in the mishna, i.e., the impurity of a creeping animal, semen, and one who contracted ritual impurity from a corpse, |
| Kelim 2:2 | hear | Chullin 54b:13 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>the smallest of earthenware vessels,</b> if <b>they, or</b> even <b>their</b> broken-off <b>bases or sides,</b> can <b>sit,</b> i.e., remain upright, <b>without being supported,</b> |
| Kelim 5:1 | raises a contradiction | Chullin 124a:7 | The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this mishna from another mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:1): A clay <b>oven</b> in <b>its original state,</b> once it is finished being built, is susceptible to ritual impurity if it is <b>four</b> handbreadths tall. <b>And</b> with regard to an oven that became impure and was subsequently broken, if <b>its remains</b> include a piece <b>four</b> handbreadths tall, that piece remains impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Kelim 5:1 | handbreadth? As it is taught | Niddah 26b:1 | toy <b>ovens with</b> which <b>girls</b> play, whose minimum measure with regard to ritual impurity is also one <b>handbreadth? As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:1): A clay <b>oven</b> in <b>its original,</b> unbroken, <b>state</b> is susceptible to ritual impurity if it is <b>four</b> handbreadths tall. <b>And</b> with regard to an oven that became impure and was subsequently broken, if <b>its remains</b> include a piece <b>four</b> handbreadths tall, that piece remains impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Kelim 5:2 | But isn’t there | Niddah 26a:19 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the following mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:2): <b>A stone that protrudes from the oven</b> by one <b>handbreadth,</b> which is used as a handle for lifting and carrying the oven, <b>and</b> similarly a stone that protrudes <b>from the stove three fingerbreadths</b> is considered as having <b>a connection</b> to the oven or stove with regard to ritual impurity. Consequently, if the oven or stove becomes impure, then the stone handle, which is classified as part of the oven, is likewise rendered impure. If the handle is longer than that, the additional length will be removed, so it is not considered to be part of the oven. |
| Kelim 5:2 | a dispute. As the latter clause | Niddah 26b:4 | The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, the fact that Rabbi Oshaya does not mention a stone protruding from an oven can be explained in the same manner, since <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also</b> subject to <b>a dispute. As the latter clause</b> of that mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:2) <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> When the Sages <b>said</b> that a stone protruding from an oven is considered a handle if it protrudes one <b>handbreadth,</b> they said so <b>only</b> with regard to a stone that protrudes <b>from the oven and toward the wall.</b> If the stone protrudes more than that, it is not considered a handle, as it is likely to be removed so that the oven can be moved closer to the wall. But if the stone protrudes toward the airspace of the house, it is considered an oven handle even if it protrudes more than one handbreadth. |
| Kelim 5:7 | Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection | Chullin 123b:20 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:7): With regard to <b>an oven that has become impure, how does one purify it? One divides</b> the oven <b>into three</b> parts <b>and scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster</b> that surrounds the oven |
| Kelim 5:10 | there | Bava Metzia59a:12 | § Apropos the topic of verbal mistreatment, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 5:10): If <b>one cut</b> an earthenware oven widthwise <b>into segments, and placed sand between each and every segment, Rabbi Eliezer deems it ritually pure.</b> Because of the sand, its legal status is not that of a complete vessel, and therefore it is not susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And the Rabbis deem it ritually impure,</b> as it is functionally a complete oven. |
| Kelim 8:1 | as we learned | Zevachim 3a:14 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 8:1): In the case of <b>an oven that</b> one <b>divided with boards or with curtains, and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in one place, all</b> of the food in the oven, including that on the other side of the partition, is rendered <b>impure.</b> |
| Kelim 8:11 | But didn’t we learn | Keritot 13a:21 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 8:11): In the case of a menstruating <b>woman who had milk dripping from her nipples, and it fell into the airspace of an oven, the oven</b> becomes <b>impure. And</b> this poses <b>a difficulty for us: In what</b> way was the milk <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, such that it can become impure or render the oven impure? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It was rendered susceptible <b>by the drop</b> of milk <b>smeared on the nipple.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a woman’s milk must be rendered susceptible in order to contract impurity. |
| Kelim 10:6 | said | Bava Kamma105a:12 | § The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 10:6) that with regard to a sealed earthenware <b>barrel that was punctured and was</b> then <b>sealed by sediments</b> from its contents, the sediments have effectively <b>saved</b> the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity if the barrel were to come into contact with an impure item, as it is once again considered a sealed barrel. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>sealed half of</b> the hole, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that since the hole is not currently large enough to allow ritual impurity to penetrate, the barrel is considered sealed; or perhaps we say that since the hole was initially large enough to allow impurity to penetrate, and it has not yet been sealed completely, the barrel retains its status and is not considered sealed? |
| Kelim 11:1 | previous ritual impurity. As we learned | Avodah Zarah52a:20 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> is referring to a vessel that was used for idol worship before it broke, and <b>he is raising the dilemma with regard to</b> the matter of <b>previous ritual impurity. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 11:1): With regard to <b>metal vessels,</b> both <b>their flat</b> vessels, which have no repositories, <b>and their receptacles,</b> vessels that have repositories, <b>are</b> all <b>impure</b> if they came into contact with a primary source of ritual impurity. If <b>they broke, they</b> thereby <b>became purified.</b> But if one <b>remade</b> the broken vessels into new <b>vessels, they reassume their previous impurity.</b> |
| Kelim 12:2 | in a mishna | Bava Kamma92b:13 | Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael”</b> (Genesis 28:9). It <b>is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him”</b> (Judges 11:3). <b>And</b> it <b>is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him</b> (Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <b>We learned</b> it <b>in a mishna</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:2): <b>All that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually impure</b> is <b>ritually impure; all that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually pure</b> is <b>ritually pure. And we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught</b> did the <b>starling go to the raven but because it is its kind,</b> as it too is a non-kosher bird. |
| Kelim 12:7 | there | Bava Metzia52a:15 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:7): <b>A <i>sela</i> that was invalidated</b> for use as a coin, <b>and</b> an individual <b>designated it so that he would weigh with it</b> items that require <b>weighing,</b> is susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure.</b> His designation rendered it a vessel like any other weight. <b>To</b> what <b>extent can the coin erode and</b> it <b>will</b> still <b>be permitted to maintain it? For a <i>sela</i>,</b> it is an erosion of <b>two dinars,</b> half its value. If it eroded to an extent that it was worth <b>less than that, he must cut</b> it into pieces to prevent its being confused with a proper coin. |
| Kelim 13:2 | as he explained to me | Bava Metzia33a:13 | <b>Rava said: For example, Rav Seḥora</b> is my teacher with regard to these matters, <b>as he explained to me</b> the meaning of the term in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 13:2) <b><i>zuhama listeron</i>,</b> a utensil with a spoon on one end and a fork on the other. <b>Shmuel rent his garment</b> in mourning <b>over</b> the passing of <b>one of the Sages who explained to him</b> the meaning of a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 3:6) that describes the two keys that opened the compartment through which the priest would enter the Sanctuary each morning: <b>One</b> is the key with which the priest would open the inside lock. He would insert his arm <b>up to his armpit</b> through a small opening in the door and reach <b>down</b> and open the lock that was at the bottom of the door on the inside, and he would go through that door into a compartment. <b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> is the key with <b>which</b> the priest <b>opened</b> the lock on the inner door of the compartment, through which he entered the Sanctuary, and he opened that lock <b>directly.</b> |
| Kelim 13:8 | Didn’t we learn | Yevamot 43a:2 | Rabbi Naḥum questioned the principle that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with an unattributed ruling in a mishna and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 13:8): <b>A comb</b> made <b>for</b> combing beaten <b>flax</b> in preparation for spinning, from <b>which its teeth were removed and</b> only <b>two</b> of its teeth <b>remained in it,</b> is still suitable for combing. It is therefore considered a utensil and will become <b>ritually impure</b> if it comes in contact with ritual impurity. However, if only <b>one</b> tooth remained, so that the comb was no longer suitable for combing, it is no longer considered a utensil and so will remain <b>ritually pure</b> even if it comes in contact with ritual impurity. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> of the teeth <b>that were individually removed on their own,</b> since they do serve a purpose, e.g., they may be embedded and used as hooks, they are considered utensils and can become <b>ritually impure.</b> |
| Kelim 15:2 | as we learned | Bava Batra66a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> the reference with regard to the hollowed-out duct must be to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer concerning</b> a baker’s <b>board</b> on which he kneads the dough, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 15:2): With regard to <b>a baker’s board [<i>daf shel naḥtomin</i>] that was affixed to the wall, Rabbi Eliezer renders</b> it <b>not susceptible to ritual impurity, while the Rabbis render</b> it <b>susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> This seems to indicate that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, anything that is affixed to the ground or to something else that is affixed to the ground is treated like land, and therefore it cannot become ritually impure. |
| Kelim 16:1 | lengthwise, but not widthwise? Didn’t we learn | Moed Katan10a:6 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: Is there one who says that interweaving</b> means tying the cords <b>lengthwise, but not widthwise? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 16:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: A bed</b> is considered a utensil and becomes susceptible to ritual impurity <b>from when one interweaves three</b> rows of <b>meshes in it,</b> i.e., three rows lengthwise and widthwise? It is clear from here that interweaving a bed involves tying its cords lengthwise and widthwise. |
| Kelim 16:1 | raises an objection | Sanhedrin 20b:2 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 16:1): <b>From when</b> are <b>wooden vessels</b> considered complete and <b>susceptible to impurity?</b> In the case of <b>a bed or a crib,</b> this happens <b>once they are rubbed with fish skin,</b> which smoothens the wood. The Gemara asks: <b>And if a bed is woven on its back side,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan claimed, <b>why do I</b> need <b>rubbing with fish skin?</b> Doesn’t the weaving cover the smooth part of the bed? <b>Rather,</b> instead of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation, say that the weaving of both <b>this and that,</b> a <i>dargash</i> and a bed, is <b>on its inside,</b> and the difference between them is that on <b>a bed,</b> the straps <b>go in and out of holes</b> on the posts, whereas on <b>a <i>dargash</i>, they go in and out of loops.</b> |
| Kelim 17:9 | as we learned | Bekhorot 39b:16 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says</b> that this <i>baraita</i> discussing the fingerbreadth is referring <b>to the two cubits</b> mentioned in a different context, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:9): <b>There were two</b> rods for measuring <b>cubits</b> |
| Kelim 17:9 | we learned | Menachot 98a:6 | The Gemara asks: May one derive <b>from the fact</b> that the cubit of six handbreadths is referred to as a medium cubit <b>that there is a cubit that is larger than</b> the medium cubit? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> there is a larger cubit, <b>and</b> so <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:9): <b>There were two</b> rods for measuring <b>cubits in</b> the chamber of <b>Shushan the capital,</b> which was located above the eastern gate of the Temple Mount, <b>one in the northeast corner and one in the southeast corner.</b> The one <b>that was in the northeast corner was longer than</b> the cubit used <b>by Moses</b> in the building of the Tabernacle, which was of six handbreadths, by <b>half a fingerbreadth,</b> and the one <b>that was in the southeast corner was longer than</b> the other one by another <b>half a fingerbreadth.</b> One therefore <b>finds it longer than Moses’</b> cubit by a full <b>fingerbreadth.</b> |
| Kelim 17:10 | there | Menachot 97a:12 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 17:10) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: All</b> the <b>cubits that were</b> mentioned <b>with regard to the Temple</b> were <b>medium</b> cubits, consisting of six handbreadths, <b>except</b> in the case <b>of</b> the following items: <b>The golden altar,</b> which was one cubit long and one cubit wide; each protruding <b>corner</b> of the external altar, which were one cubit long, one cubit wide, and one cubit high; <b>the surrounding ledge</b> of the external altar, which was five cubits high and one cubit wide; <b>and the base</b> of the altar, which was one cubit high and one cubit wide. In all these cases, the cubit was of five handbreadths. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The measure of <b>a cubit</b> that was used with regard to the <b>building</b> of the Temple was a cubit of <b>six handbreadths, but</b> the cubit mentioned <b>with regard to</b> the Temple <b>vessels,</b> e.g., the Table, the Candelabrum and the golden altar, was a smaller cubit of <b>five</b> handbreadths. |
| Kelim 17:12 | As we learned | Bekhorot 37b:20 | <b>And</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rav Taḥlifa: <b>If so,</b> that the measure of the deficiency according to the opinion of Beit Hillel is the size of a <i>sela</i> coin, <b>you have made the statement of Beit Shammai and the statement of Beit Hillel one</b> and the same, since the size of a <i>sela</i> coin and a drilled hole is identical. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:12): With regard to <b>a window that was not fashioned by the hands of a person,</b> such as where a stone fell out of the wall by itself, <b>its measure</b> for which ritual impurity is transmitted from room to room is like <b>the size of a large fist. And this is</b> the size of <b>the fist of Ben Avatiaḥ,</b> who was known to be an exceptionally large man. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: And</b> the size of this fist <b>is like</b> the size of <b>a large human head.</b> |
| Kelim 17:15 | that we learned | Chullin 12b:7 | <b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>action</b> of a minor, whether the action of a minor that indicates intent is effective. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>action</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action</b> that is halakhically effective? With regard to <b>thought as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They do not have</b> the capacity for halakhically effective <b>thought.</b> |
| Kelim 17:15 | that we learned | Chullin 13a:9 | <b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>thought</b> of a minor. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>thought</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>do not have</b> the capacity for effective <b>thought?</b> With regard to <b>action as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action.</b> |
| Kelim 18:1 | with regard to a chest, as we learned | Menachot 31a:1 | that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to a chest, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 18:1): A wooden chest that is large enough to contain forty <i>se’a</i> is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity, since it is no longer considered a vessel. In determining its capacity, <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>it is measured on the inside, and Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>it is measured on the outside</b> so that the volume of the walls of the chest itself is included in the measurement. <b>And</b> both Beit Shammai <b>and</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that the volume of the legs and the volume of the rims [<i>halevazbazin</i>]</b> are <b>not measured.</b> |
| Kelim 19:2 | Rav Naḥman | Chullin 54b:11 | <b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 19:2): The end of <b>a rope that extends from</b> a rope <b>bed is not susceptible to ritual impurity until</b> it is <b>five handbreadths</b> long. If the bed becomes impure, the rope remains pure, because it has no use and is therefore not considered part of the bed. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that amount? If so, the word: Until, means until and including the exact measure. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is <b>like</b> a rope whose length is <b>above</b> that amount. |
| Kelim 19:2 | is also precise, | Chullin 55a:6 | The Gemara notes: The language <b>is also precise,</b> i.e., it is evident that the phrase: Up to, is always interpreted stringently, as the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 19:2) states that if a rope extending from a rope bed is of any length up to five handbreadths, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity, but if it is of any length from five up to ten handbreadths, it is susceptible. And a <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches with regard to that</b> mishna: If the rope was exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long, it is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>above</b> that; if the rope was exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long, it is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that. In both cases, the measure is interpreted stringently. |
| Kelim 22:1 | coating. For didn’t we learn | Chagigah 26b:8 | The Gemara asks another question: <b>Let us derive</b> this fact, i.e., that the table can contract ritual impurity, not because it is portable but <b>due to</b> its golden <b>coating. For didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 22:1): Concerning <b>a table and a <i>dulpaki</i> that</b> some of its surface <b>became broken off, or that one coated with marble,</b> i.e., stone not being susceptible to impurity: If <b>he left on them a place</b> on the surface that remained unbroken or uncoated, big enough <b>for placing cups, it</b> remains <b>susceptible to impurity</b> as a wooden vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It must have an unbroken and uncoated <b>place</b> big enough <b>for placing pieces</b> of meat and bread as well in order to maintain susceptibility to impurity as a wooden vessel. It is clear from this mishna that if a table is completely coated with stone it is not susceptible to impurity, showing that the status of a vessel follows its external coating, not its main material. The Temple table, which was coated with gold, should have the status of a metal vessel. |
| Kelim 22:1 | covering. Didn’t we learn | Menachot 96b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is it necessary to derive that the Table is susceptible to impurity due to the fact that it is not designated to rest in a fixed place? <b>I may derive</b> that it is susceptible to impurity <b>due to</b> its gold <b>covering. Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 22:1): Consider the case of <b>the table and the <i>dulbeki</i>,</b> a small table upon which the food and drink are placed before being served at the dining table, <b>that were</b> partially <b>broken, or that one covered with marble</b> stone, which is not susceptible to impurity. If <b>an area of their</b> surface large enough for <b>placing cups</b> there <b>was left</b> unbroken or uncovered with marble they remain <b>susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The remaining surface <b>area</b> must be large enough for <b>placing pieces</b> of meat and bread as well. |
| Kelim 25:6 | by rabbinic law. As we learned | Bekhorot 38a:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to ritual impurity</b> that is <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>indeed</b> a vessel that is purified through rinsing can be become impure even through its outside. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> the <b>ritual impurity of liquids,</b> i.e., liquids that became impure and subsequently touched the vessel, which becomes impure only <b>by rabbinic law. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:6): With regard to <b>a vessel whose outside became ritually impure by</b> contact with impure <b>liquids,</b> only <b>its outside is impure,</b> but <b>its inside, its rim, its ear-shaped handle, and its</b> straight <b>handle are pure.</b> If <b>its inside became impure,</b> it becomes <b>impure</b> in <b>its entirety.</b> |
| Kelim 25:6 | As we learned | Niddah 7b:17 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: Rabbi Eliezer agrees that if the interior of a vessel is rendered impure by contact with impure liquids, it renders impure any <i>teruma</i> foods that come into contact with it. <b>But what is different</b> about the <b>exterior of vessels, that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>cited</b> them as having a more lenient status? The Gemara answers: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> their <i>halakhot</i> are more <b>lenient</b> than those of the other parts of the vessel. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:6): With regard to <b>a vessel whose exterior was rendered impure by</b> contact with impure <b>liquids,</b> its <b>exterior is impure,</b> while its others parts, such as <b>its interior, its ear,</b> i.e., its looped handle, <b>its rim,</b> the edge of the vessel that protrudes outward, and <b>its handles, are pure.</b> But if its <b>interior was rendered impure, it is all impure.</b> |
| Kelim 25:9 | learn | Menachot 69a:15 | <b>If we say</b> that the dilemma was raised <b>with regard to</b> a case where the wicker basket was ritually impure and the question is if <b>its ritual impurity is nullified</b> by the elephant swallowing it, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:9): <b>All vessels descend into their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity by means of thought.</b> Although an unfinished vessel cannot become ritually impure, if the craftsman decided not to finish it, it immediately assumes the halakhic status of a completed vessel and can become ritually impure. <b>But they ascend from their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity only by means of a change</b> resulting from <b>an action.</b> A ritually impure vessel, once it undergoes physical change, is no longer ritually impure. Therefore, as the wicker basket remained intact without physical change, it is clear that it remains ritually impure. |
| Kelim 26:4 | And we learned likewise | Menachot 37b:12 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya</b> similarly <b>says: One who ties his garment has not done anything</b> of consequence with regard to exempting the garment from the obligation of ritual fringes. <b>What is the reason? It is considered as though</b> the garment is <b>untied,</b> since the knot can be loosened at any time. <b>And we learned likewise</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:4): <b>All bound</b> leather <b>jugs,</b> i.e., those whose bottoms are not sewn but tied, <b>are ritually pure,</b> i.e., they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. This is because they are not considered receptacles, as these knots will be untied, <b>except for</b> leather <b>jugs of Arabs,</b> who would tie them with a permanent knot. |
| Kelim 26:7 | As we learned | Bava Kamma66b:13 | <b>As we learned</b> in the previous mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:7): <b>Wherever there is no work lacking</b> for an item to be considered finished, one’s <b>thought renders it susceptible to ritual impurity; when there is</b> still some <b>work lacking</b> for the item to be considered finished, <b>thought does not render it susceptible to ritual impurity, except for</b> the case of a leather table <b>top.</b> Although further work is required to smooth out the edges, one’s thought can render it susceptible to impurity because people do not care if this leather table top has uneven edges. It is with regard to this case of a table top that the mishna distinguishes between a homeowner and a leatherworker. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s explanation is rejected. |
| Kelim 26:8 | there | Bava Kamma114a:13 | § Apropos the discussion with regard to an owner’s despair of retrieving a lost or stolen item, the Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 26:8): With regard to <b>hides</b> that are tanned by the <b>owner</b> himself, <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity. |
| Kelim 26:8 | Abaye raised an objection to Rav Yosef | Bava Kamma66b:7 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to Rav Yosef</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:8): With regard to <b>hides belonging to a homeowner,</b> one’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to</b> contracting <b>ritual impurity.</b> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity. |
| Kelim 26:9 | Reish Lakish | Chullin 123b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:9): In the case of <b>a hide</b> that is <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> if the owner <b>intended with regard to</b> the hide to make it <b>into straps and sandals, when he applies a scalpel [<i>izmel</i>] to</b> the hide, the hide becomes <b>pure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide does not become pure <b>until he reduces</b> the size of the hide to a measure of less <b>than five handbreadths. In any event, when he reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less than five handbreadths, everyone agrees that it becomes <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> according the opinion of Reish Lakish that the hide should not become pure, as it is <b>repairable.</b> |
| Kelim 26:9 | Reish Lakish | Chullin 124a:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from that which is taught in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:9): With regard to <b>a hide</b> that is <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> if the owner <b>intended with regard to</b> the hide <b>to</b> fashion it into <b>straps and sandals,</b> then <b>when he applies a scalpel to</b> the hide, the hide becomes <b>pure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide does not become pure <b>until he reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less <b>than five handbreadths.</b> |
| Kelim 27:9 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 24a:17 | <b>Abaye said to him: And do we say</b> that an item that is already <b>saturated with impurity</b> cannot be rendered impure a second time? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 27:9): With regard to <b>a sheet</b> that is impure due to <b>ritual impurity</b> |
| Kelim 27:10 | as we learned | Chullin 72b:9 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 27:10) concerning ritual impurity imparted by treading: If a person who is ritually impure due to having experienced a bodily emission, such as a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], sits or leans upon an item that was designated for that purpose, the item is rendered ritually impure due to ritual impurity imparted by treading. The item will then impart impurity to people or utensils that come in contact with it. In the case of a garment that is impure with ritual impurity imparted by treading that was <b>three by three</b> handbreadths in size, i.e., the minimum size to impart such impurity, <b>that was split</b> into smaller pieces, each part is <b>ritually pure with regard to</b> ritual impurity <b>imparted by treading</b> and will no longer impart impurity to people and utensils that come in contact with it. |
| Kelim 28:8 | elsewhere | Chullin 123a:16 | §The Gemara discusses a matter similar to the previous discussion of a partially flayed hide. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 28:8): A ritually impure garment that tears is rendered pure because it is no longer considered a useable garment. In the case of a ritually impure <b>garment that one began to tear, once the majority of</b> the garment <b>is torn,</b> the two sections are <b>no longer</b> considered as having <b>a connection, and</b> since it is no longer considered a useable garment, it <b>is pure.</b> |
| Kelim 28:8 | Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection | Zevachim 95a:5 | <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection</b> based upon a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 28:8): <b>The</b> particularly <b>thick</b> garments <b>and the soft</b> garments <b>are not subject to</b> the standard measure of <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths, with regard to determining their susceptibility to becoming ritually impure. Because of their particular qualities, such garments are useful only when they are larger and are not considered significant items when they measure three by three. Since the High Priest’s robe is a thick garment, why must one bring it into the courtyard only in portions of less than three by three? |
| Kelim 29:5 | teaching us? We learned | Bava Batra89b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this statement <b>teaching us? We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 29:5): With regard to the <b>rope</b> from which the <b>scales</b> are suspended, if the balance scale belongs <b>to a storekeeper or to homeowners</b> it must be <b>one handbreadth</b> in length for it to be susceptible to ritual impurity. Why, then, is the statement of Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish necessary? The Gemara answers: Although the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> discusses the rope from which the scales are suspended, <b>it was</b> still <b>necessary for</b> Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish to mention the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the scale’s <b>lever and cord, which we did not learn about</b> in that mishna. |
