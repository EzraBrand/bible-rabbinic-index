| Shekalim 1:1 | there | Megillah 29a:20 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1): <b>On the first of Adar they make</b> a public <b>announcement concerning</b> the forthcoming collection of half-<b>shekels.</b> The money is used for the communal offerings in the Temple in the coming year. |
| Shekalim 1:1 | raises a contradiction | Moed Katan6a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Do they go out to</b> uproot <b>diverse kinds during the intermediate days of a Festival?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1), which states: <b>On the first of Adar</b> the court <b>issues a proclamation concerning</b> the collection of <b>the shekels,</b> i.e., the yearly half-shekel contribution to the Temple treasury made by each adult male for the purpose of buying communal offerings. <b>And</b> the court also issues a proclamation <b>with regard to</b> the obligation to uproot <b>diverse kinds</b> from the fields. |
| Shekalim 1:4 | As we learned | Arakhin 4a:7 | § The Gemara applies the same line of questioning to the mishna here: <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation…priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious? Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri,</b> who holds that priests are not obligated to contribute a yearly half-shekel to purchase the communal supplies. Therefore, one might have thought that they are not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of valuations, as the Gemara will explain. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified</b> before the Sages <b>in Yavne: Any priest who contributes</b> the half-<b>shekel</b> for communal offerings <b>is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to contribute. |
| Shekalim 1:4 | As we learned | Menachot 21b:14 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified in Yavne: Any priest who contributes his shekel is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to do so. Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But the priests</b> who do not contribute the shekel <b>interpret this</b> following <b>verse to their own</b> advantage in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva. |
| Shekalim 1:4 | as we learned | Menachot 46b:16 | <b>Rabba said: From where do I say</b> this, i.e., what is the source for my statement? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>ben Bukhri testified</b> before the Sages <b>in Yavne: Any priest who contributes his</b> half-<b>shekel is not</b> considered <b>a sinner,</b> despite the fact that he is not obligated to do so. |
| Shekalim 1:7 | designation? But didn’t we learn | Beitzah 39b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rav Naḥman hold</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:7): If <b>brothers</b> divided up inherited property among themselves and subsequently joined their property again and became <b>partners, they are obligated to</b> add <b>a <i>kalbon</i>,</b> a small coin, to the obligatory half-shekel yearly Temple donation. The <i>kalbon</i> covered both the cost to the Temple of exchanging half-shekels into larger coins and the depreciation of the donated coin. Although a whole shekel given by two partners does not need to be changed into a larger coin, the Sages imposed the same <i>kalbon</i> fee on the partners as on everyone else. However, these partners <b>are exempt from</b> the <b>animal tithe,</b> in accordance with the standard <i>halakha</i> that people who own animals in partnership are exempt from the animal tithe. |
| Shekalim 2:1 | as we learned | Bekhorot 51a:5 | The Gemara elaborates: The <i>halakha</i> that the half-shekel payment dues to the Temple cannot be paid using items of equivalent value is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:1): When people who live far from Jerusalem wish to send to Jerusalem the shekels that have been levied from their community, <b>they</b> may <b>combine</b> their <b>shekels</b> and exchange them <b>for darics [<i>darbonot</i>],</b> which are large gold coins, <b>due to</b> the hardship of <b>carrying on the journey.</b> Instead of carrying large amounts of shekels, the agents who deliver the funds will bring a much lighter burden of gold coins with them. They may exchange them only for coins, not for items of equivalent value. |
| Shekalim 2:1 | there | Yoma 65a:11 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:1): If <b>residents of a city sent their shekels</b> to the Temple with a messenger, <b>and</b> the shekels <b>were stolen or were lost</b> along the way; <b>if</b> the <b>funds were</b> already <b>collected,</b> i.e., the coins for the new year’s offerings were taken from the chamber before the money was stolen, the messengers <b>take an oath to the treasurers</b> of the Temple that they did not unlawfully use the shekels, but that they were taken unbeknownst to them or by force. This is because once the necessary coins have been removed, all other coins that have been dedicated for this purpose are considered Temple property wherever they are, and their subsequent theft does not change that status. If the messengers take this oath, they are exempt from monetary liability. |
| Shekalim 2:5 | hear | Sanhedrin 48a:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof in support of Rava’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:5): The money <b>left over</b> from the money that was collected for burying <b>the dead</b> must be allocated <b>to</b> the burial of other <b>dead</b> people. The money <b>left over</b> from the money that was collected for burying a particular <b>dead person</b> is given <b>to his heirs.</b> Evidently, money that had been designated for the sake of a dead person but was not actually used for burying him does not become forbidden, and his heirs may use it. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with money <b>that had been collected</b> for the deceased <b>during his lifetime.</b> It was thought that a certain individual was soon to die, and money was collected to cover the costs of his burial. Since at the time the money was collected the person was alive, the money had not been designated for the sake of a dead person. Therefore, one is permitted to derive benefit from it, and it is given to the heirs of the deceased. |
| Shekalim 3:2 | And we also learned | Yevamot 102b:17 | <b>And we also learned</b> similarly in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:2): <b>The one who collects the funds</b> of shekels donated to the Temple from the chamber and puts them into baskets in order to be used <b>may not enter</b> to collect the funds <b>wearing a garment [<i>pargod</i>] that is cuffed [<i>ḥafut</i>], nor wearing an <i>anpileya</i>, and needless to say</b> that he may not enter wearing <b>a shoe or a sandal, because one may not enter</b> the Temple <b>courtyard wearing a shoe or a sandal.</b> It is prohibited for the one collecting funds from the chamber to enter the chamber wearing a garment or footwear in which money could be hidden, lest people come to suspect that he hid in them funds collected from the chamber. In any case, the wording of the mishna indicates that an <i>anpileya</i> is not considered a type of shoe, since it is permitted to enter the Temple wearing an <i>anpileya</i> when there is no reason for suspicion, unlike a shoe or sandal, which can never be worn in the Temple. |
| Shekalim 4:1 | elsewhere | Menachot 84a:4 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:1): The <b>guards</b> who are appointed by the court to protect some <b>of</b> the <b>produce that grew without being purposely planted [<i>sefiḥin</i>] during the Sabbatical</b> Year, in order that it can be used for the <i>omer</i> and the offering of the two loaves, <b>collect their wages from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> |
| Shekalim 4:2 | the wall of the city and its towers comes from the remainder of the chamber, as we learned | Kiddushin 54a:5 | The Gemara continues the question: <b>But why</b> should one be liable for using the old shekels? <b>Let us say</b> the same logic: One is not liable, <b>because they were</b> initially <b>given</b> on the condition that people may <b>benefit</b> from them, <b>since the Torah was not given to</b> the <b>ministering angels</b> and people could not help but benefit from them. This is <b>as</b> the money to repair <b>the wall of the city and its towers comes from the remainder of the chamber, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:2): <b>The wall of the city, its towers, and all</b> of the <b>requirements of the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>come from the remainder of the chamber.</b> It is not possible for passersby to avoid benefiting from the shade provided by the walls of the city. The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say</b> that the opinion that one is liable for misuse of property consecrated to the Temple by using money from the remainder of the chamber is that of <b>Rabbi Meir. Rather,</b> emend the mishna and <b>say</b> that it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Shekalim 4:5 | As it is taught | Keritot 6a:20 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to that</b> incense <b>which is given to the</b> Temple <b>artisans as their wages,</b> i.e., the incense was prepared in the sacred place and was desacralized when it was given to the artisans, who subsequently consecrated it. <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): <b>The leftover incense</b> from one year could not be used the following year, as it had been purchased with the shekels collected for the previous year. <b>What would they do with it</b> in order to render it usable? The Temple treasurers <b>would remove</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of <b>the wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. <b>And they</b> would then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to the money</b> owed <b>the artisans. They</b> would then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages. And</b> finally, <b>they</b> would <b>return and purchase</b> the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels. |
| Shekalim 4:5 | as it is taught | Keritot 6a:24 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in the aforementioned mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): With regard to <b>the leftover incense, what would they do with it?</b> The Temple treasurers would <b>remove</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of <b>the wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. <b>And they</b> would then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to the money</b> owed to <b>the artisans. They</b> would then <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans as their wages. And</b> finally, <b>they would return and purchase</b> the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> |
| Shekalim 4:5 | raises an objection | Meilah 14b:1 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): With regard to the <b>incense left over</b> from the previous year, which could no longer be used, <b>what would they do with it</b> in order to render it usable again? The Temple treasurers <b>would set aside</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of the <b>wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple. |
| Shekalim 4:5 | But didn’t we learn | Shevuot 10b:9 | Rabba <b>said to him: Don’t you</b> also <b>hold that we do not say</b> that the question: The <b>sanctity that was</b> inherent <b>in them, to where has it gone,</b> poses a difficulty? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): In any fiscal year, one may use only incense that was purchased with funds collected for that year. Accordingly, the mishna asks: With regard to <b>the surplus incense</b> that remained unused at the end of the fiscal year, <b>what would</b> the Temple treasurers <b>do with it</b> in order to render it usable for the following year? They would <b>separate from</b> the Temple treasury the <b>wages for the artisans</b> who worked for the Temple, and those funds would thereby be desacralized. <b>And</b> then <b>they would desacralize</b> the surplus incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to</b> that <b>money</b> that had been set aside <b>for the artisans.</b> Then, <b>they would give</b> the now-desacralized incense <b>to the artisans as their wages, and</b> finally, <b>they would repurchase it</b> with funds <b>from the new collection</b> carried out for the coming year. |
| Shekalim 4:5 | the Sages | Shevuot 11b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Shimon</b> and hold that the court does make such stipulations, <b>who are they?</b> Where is their opinion recorded? <b>If we say</b> that they are <b>the Sages</b> who ruled, in the mishna cited above (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5), <b>with regard to</b> surplus <b>incense</b> that it may be redeemed, |
| Shekalim 4:6 | raises an objection | Keritot 6a:18 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:6): With regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, they are consecrated for Temple maintenance. <b>And</b> if <b>among them there were items suitable for</b> use as <b>communal offerings,</b> which may not be used for the maintenance of the Temple but only for sacrificial purposes, what is done with those items to remove their consecration for Temple maintenance so that they can be properly consecrated for sacrificial use? <b>They are given to</b> Temple <b>artisans as their wages,</b> and they are thereby desacralized. They can then be consecrated again for their proper purpose. |
| Shekalim 4:7 | elsewhere | Temurah 20a:13 | § The Gemara continues to discuss Rabbi Shimon’s opinion in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:7): In the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> all <b>his possessions</b> without specifying for what purpose, <b>and among them there is an animal that is suitable</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar,</b> or multiple such animals that are <b>males and females,</b> what should be done with them? |
| Shekalim 4:7 | as it is taught | Temurah 31b:9 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:7): In the case of <b>one who consecrates his possessions</b> without specification, <b>and among</b> the consecrated property <b>there was an animal suitable</b> for sacrifice <b>upon the altar, male or female,</b> what should be done with it? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Males</b> that are suitable to be brought as a burnt offerings should <b>be sold for the needs of burnt offerings,</b> i.e., to individuals obligated to bring a burnt offering. <b>And females</b> should <b>be sold for the purpose of</b> being used for <b>peace offerings. And</b> the <b>money</b> received from <b>their</b> sale is <b>allocated with the rest of</b> his <b>property for Temple maintenance.</b> |
| Shekalim 4:7 | of Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned | Zevachim 103a:14 | <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:7): If <b>one consecrates his property</b> without specifying the purpose, generally speaking, it goes toward Temple maintenance. <b>But</b> if <b>among it were animals fit to</b> be sacrificed on the <b>altar,</b> either <b>male or female,</b> then <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Animals that are fit for offerings must be sacrificed. Therefore, the <b>male</b> animals <b>shall be sold for the purpose of burnt offerings</b> to those who need to bring such offerings, and the <b>female</b> animals, which cannot be brought as burnt offerings, <b>shall be sold for the purpose of peace offerings</b> to those who need to bring such offerings. <b>And</b> because they were consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>their proceeds shall be allocated with the rest of</b> the person’s <b>property for Temple maintenance.</b> |
| Shekalim 6:5 | hear | Menachot 104a:7 | <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the answer from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:5): There were <b>six</b> collection horns <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>and we say: For what</b> were they <b>designated?</b> They were designated <b>for</b> funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>sin offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of <b>guilt offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of a <b>guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>guilt offering of a leper,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>pairs</b> of birds, and for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>meal offering of a sinner.</b> |
| Shekalim 6:6 | there | Yoma 55a:18 | § The mishna taught that the High Priest <b>emerged and placed</b> the bowl with the remaining blood of the bull <b>on the golden pedestal in the Sanctuary,</b> and later he placed the goat’s blood on a second pedestal, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda there was only one pedestal. The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:6) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: There were no</b> collection <b>horns for obligatory nests,</b> i.e., the pairs of pigeons or turtledoves brought as sin- and burnt-offerings by women after childbirth or other individuals, <b>due to the</b> concern of <b>mixtures.</b> |
| Shekalim 6:6 | If so, you have nullified the interpretation of Jehoiada the priest. As it is taught | Zevachim 103a:12 | <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> said to him: <b>If so, you have nullified the interpretation of Jehoiada the priest. As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:6) that <b>Jehoiada the priest taught this interpretation:</b> The verse states: <b>“It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:19). The phrase “before the Lord” teaches that if <b>any</b> money <b>comes on account of a sin offering or on account of a guilt offering,</b> i.e., it is left over after their purchase, <b>burnt offerings must be purchased with it,</b> and their <b>flesh</b> must be burned on the altar <b>to the Lord.</b> But <b>its hide</b> shall go <b>to the priests.</b> Rabbi Yehuda did not respond, indicating that he conceded that the hides of such offerings go to the priests. |
| Shekalim 7:2 | Didn’t we learn | Bava Metzia26a:7 | <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>money that was found before animal merchants</b> in Jerusalem, it is <b>always</b> assumed to be money of the second <b>tithe,</b> as most of the animals purchased in Jerusalem were bought with second-tithe money. This <i>halakha</i> applies both during a Festival and throughout the year, as people would typically purchase animals for meat with their second-tithe money. If the money was found <b>on the Temple Mount</b> it is considered <b>non-sacred</b> money. This <i>halakha</i> applies even during a Festival, when people would come to Jerusalem with second-tithe money in hand, as it can be assumed that one who entered the Temple Mount had already spent that money and only non-sacred money is left in his possession. |
| Shekalim 7:6 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 51b:17 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations; <b>and this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: In the case of <b>a gentile who sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are sacrificed at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury. |
| Shekalim 7:6 | is that which we learned | Menachot 73b:12 | § The Gemara discusses a related matter. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations. <b>And this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found sacrificial animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: If <b>a gentile sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are offered at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury. Evidently, a gentile can offer libations as well as burnt offerings. |
| Shekalim 7:7 | elsewhere | Menachot 21b:2 | With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that salt is not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:7): The court instituted an ordinance <b>about the salt and about the wood</b> in the Temple to the effect <b>that the priests may derive benefit from them. Shmuel says: They taught only</b> that the priests may derive benefit from the salt <b>for</b> use on <b>their offerings, but not for eating</b> it. |
| Shekalim 8:2 | as we learned | Chullin 90b:15 | The case of the <b>Curtain</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 8:2): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, the deputy</b> High Priest: The <b>Curtain</b> is the <b>thickness of a handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>]. It is woven from seventy-two strands [<i>nirim</i>]</b> of yarn, <b>and each and every strand [<i>nima</i>]</b> of those seventy-two is made from <b>twenty-four threads</b> consisting of six threads each of sky-blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and fine linen. <b>Its length</b> is <b>forty cubits,</b> the height of the Sanctuary, <b>and its width</b> is <b>twenty cubits,</b> the width of the entrance. <b>And</b> it <b>is made from eighty-two ten-thousands,</b> i.e., 820,000 dinars. <b>And</b> the overseers of the Temple <b>make two</b> new Curtains every <b>year. And</b> the Curtain was so heavy that when it was immersed, <b>three hundred priests would immerse it.</b> |
