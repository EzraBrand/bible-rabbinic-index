| Nazir 2:2 | is taught | Nazir 11a:8 | The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Nazir</i> 2:2) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina.</b> If one <b>said: I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will be allowed to drink wine and may become</b> ritually <b>impure from corpses, he is a nazirite and is prohibited from all of them because he stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, and</b> with regard to <b>anyone who stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, his stipulation is void.</b> |
