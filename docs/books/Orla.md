| Orla 1:1 | As we learned | Sotah 43b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Actually,</b> one returns home if he grafts <b>a young</b> tree <b>with</b> another <b>young</b> tree, <b>and</b> it is a case <b>in which he planted this first</b> one <b>for a fence or for beams,</b> so that he is exempt from battle only because of the second tree, which he grafts for fruit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:1): In a case of <b>one who plants</b> a tree <b>for a fence or</b> to yield wood <b>for beams,</b> the tree is <b>exempt from the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>orla</i>.</b> |
| Orla 1:2 | As we learned | Sotah 43b:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of an older tree, <b>if one changes his mind about it</b> and wants it to be a young tree obligated in <i>orla</i>, <b>it cannot return</b> to its previous state, as he has grafted it. Therefore, it is exempt from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>orla</i>. <b>Here,</b> when a tree is planted for wood, <b>if he changes his mind</b> and decides to grow it for fruit, <b>it can return</b> to its default state of being planted for fruit, <b>because initially it stands</b> to be used <b>for fruit.</b> Therefore, it is not exempt from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>orla</i>. This ruling is <b>just as it is concerning</b> trees that <b>grew by themselves,</b> which are subject to <i>orla</i> although they were not consciously planted for their fruit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:2): Fruit trees that <b>grew by themselves are obligated in <i>orla</i></b> although the landowner did not plant them himself. |
| Orla 1:6 | of Rabbi Yosei, as we learned | Gittin 54b:3 | The Gemara discusses the previous <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they raised a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:6): If <b>a sapling</b> that has the status <b>of <i>orla</i> or</b> a grapevine sapling has the status <b>of diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> e.g., one vine in a vineyard had grain planted near it and become prohibited, and the grain was then uprooted, <b>became intermingled with other</b> saplings, and one does not know which is the forbidden sapling, <b>he may not gather</b> the produce of any of the saplings. <b>And if he gathered</b> the produce, the forbidden produce <b>is nullified</b> if its ratio in the mixture is not more than <b>one</b> part forbidden produce <b>in two hundred</b> parts permitted produce, <b>provided that he did not intend to gather</b> the produce in order that the forbidden produce will become nullified. |
| Orla 1:7 | in accordance with the opinion of this tanna , as it is taught | Avodah Zarah35b:3 | Parenthetically, the Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rav Naḥman’s claim that the cheese of gentiles is prohibited because it is curdled in the sap of <i>orla</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with the opinion of this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:7): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who curdles</b> cheese <b>with the sap of <i>orla</i>,</b> the cheese is <b>prohibited, because</b> the sap <b>is</b> considered to be <b>fruit</b> of the tree. |
| Orla 1:7 | fruit is Rabbi Eliezer? As, didn’t we learn | Niddah 8b:4 | § Earlier, Rabbi Zeira questioned the claim of Rabbi Pedat, son of Rabbi Eliezer, that the Sage who holds that balsam is considered to be fruit and therefore has the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year is Rabbi Eliezer. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And you? Do you not hold</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught</b> that <b>balsam</b> sap has the status of <b>fruit is Rabbi Eliezer? As, didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:7) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who curdles</b> cheese <b>in the sap of <i>orla</i>,</b> the cheese is <b>prohibited,</b> as the sap is considered to be fruit of the tree. |
| Orla 1:7 | sap of the fruit they agree with him. As we learned | Niddah 8b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna that deals with balsam is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> As <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only with regard to</b> the <b>sap of the tree, but in</b> the case of the <b>sap of the fruit they agree with him. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:7) that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I heard explicitly that</b> in the case of <b>one who curdles</b> cheese <b>in the sap of the leaves</b> or <b>the sap of the roots</b> of an <i>orla</i> tree, the cheese is <b>permitted.</b> But if it is curdled <b>in the sap of unripe figs it is prohibited, because</b> that sap <b>is</b> considered to be <b>fruit.</b> |
| Orla 1:9 | forbidden? But isn’t it taught | Avodah Zarah48b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> that when <b>both this and that cause it,</b> i.e., when both permitted and forbidden items contribute to a result, the result is <b>forbidden? But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:9) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may plant the branch of an <i>orla</i></b> tree, i.e., a tree during the first three years after its planting, despite the prohibition against eating or deriving benefit from its fruit; <b>but one may not plant an <i>orla</i> nut, because it is a fruit. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi Yosei concedes that if one planted</b> an <i>orla</i> nut, <b>or sank</b> the shoot of an <i>orla</i> tree into the ground, <b>or grafted</b> an <i>orla</i> tree, deriving benefit from that which grows as a result is <b>permitted.</b> This is apparently because the growth is caused by both a forbidden cause, the <i>orla</i> nut, and a permitted cause, the ground’s nutrients. |
| Orla 2:6 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 99a:6 | <b>Abaye said to him: And</b> is it true that <b>all the forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> that are mixed with permitted foods are nullified only <b>in</b> a mixture containing <b>one hundred</b> times their volume of permitted food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6): <b>Why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who leavens</b> non-sacred food with a leavening agent that is <i>teruma</i> <b>or flavors</b> it with spices of <i>teruma</i> <b>or mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> into non-sacred food, thereby making the food forbidden for non-priests, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of food that is <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of the same <b>type.</b> But the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of <b>a different type.</b> |
| Orla 2:6 | As | Chullin 99b:2 | Abaye responded: <b>But since the first clause</b> states that it is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume, it must <b>be</b> that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where there is <b>sixty</b> times its volume. <b>As</b> the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6) <b>teaches in the first clause:</b> When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> is mixed with non-sacred food of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>leaven of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>wheat that fell into dough</b> made of non-sacred <b>wheat, and there is enough</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened, whether there is</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, or <b>whether there is not</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, the entire dough <b>is forbidden</b> to a non-priest. |
| Orla 2:7 | And it is taught in the latter clause, | Chullin 99a:7 | <b>And it is taught in the latter clause,</b> i.e., in the following mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:7): When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food <b>not</b> of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>split beans</b> of <i>teruma</i> that were cooked <b>with</b> non-sacred <b>lentils, if there are</b> enough split beans relative to the lentils to <b>impart flavor</b> to the lentils, then regardless of <b>whether there are</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, i.e., the volume of the lentils is one hundred and one times the volume of the split beans, or <b>whether there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, the entire mixture is <b>forbidden</b> to a non-priest. |
| Orla 2:8 | is taught | Avodah Zarah68a:9 | Rav Amram <b>went out, examined</b> the Mishna, <b>and discovered that</b> this dispute <b>is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:8): In the case of <b>non-sacred leaven that fell into the dough, and there is enough of it to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and</b> the dough indeed <b>became leavened, and subsequently leaven of <i>teruma</i>, or leaven of</b> forbidden <b>diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard, fell</b> into this dough, <b>and there is enough of it to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened,</b> the dough is <b>forbidden,</b> because the forbidden leaven is considered to have contributed to the process of the leavening. <b>But Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the dough <b>permitted,</b> because the additional leaven has a negative impact on the dough, which was already leavened. |
| Orla 2:11 | As we learned | Avodah Zarah49a:5 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:11): In the case of <b>non-sacred leaven and <i>teruma</i></b> leaven <b>that fell into</b> a non-sacred <b>batch of dough,</b> and <b>this one</b> alone was <b>not</b> potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and that one</b> alone was <b>not</b> potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and they combined and caused</b> the dough <b>to become leavened,</b> there is a dispute as to whether this dough has the status of <i>teruma</i>, and is therefore forbidden to non-priests, or whether it has the status of non-sacred bread. |
| Orla 2:11 | As we learned | Avodah Zarah73b:4 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:11): In the case of <b>non-sacred leaven and <i>teruma</i></b> leaven <b>that fell into</b> a non-sacred <b>batch of dough,</b> and <b>neither is this one</b> alone potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, nor is that one</b> alone potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and they combined and caused</b> the dough <b>to become leavened,</b> there is a dispute as to whether this dough has the status of <i>teruma</i>, and is therefore forbidden to non-priests, or non-sacred bread. |
| Orla 2:11 | As we learned | Temurah 12a:13 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:11): In a case of <b>non-sacred leaven and</b> leaven <b>of <i>teruma</i> that fell</b> together <b>into</b> a non-sacred batch of <b>dough,</b> and <b>this one</b> alone was <b>not</b> potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and that one</b> alone was <b>not</b> potent enough <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and they combined and caused</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, Rabbi Eliezer says: I follow the final</b> element to fall into the dough. If the <i>teruma</i> fell in last, the dough is prohibited to non-priests. <b>And the Rabbis say: Whether the forbidden item,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i>, <b>fell</b> in <b>first or the forbidden item fell</b> in <b>last, it is prohibited only if there is enough of</b> the prohibited leaven itself <b>to cause</b> the dough <b>to leaven.</b> |
| Orla 3:1 | hear | Bava Kamma101a:12 | Having determined the scenario in which the dilemma is relevant, the Gemara proceeds to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree during its first three years, <b>must be burned,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from <i>orla</i>. <b>Apparently,</b> the enhancement of an item’s <b>appearance is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye therefore remains an independent substance even after having been absorbed by the wool. |
| Orla 3:1 | Rava raises a contradiction: We learned | Bava Kamma101b:1 | The Gemara states that <b>Rava raises a contradiction: We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i> must be burned. Apparently,</b> the change in <b>appearance</b> precipitated by the <i>orla</i> peels <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye retains its status as <i>orla</i>. <b>And raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. <b>And some say</b> that any vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was <b>in reference to vessels that were</b> in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood was absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was <b>in reference to vessels that came</b> into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed. |
| Orla 3:3 | raise a contradiction | Temurah 34a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Among the items from which benefit is prohibited, the mishna states that <b>the hair of a nazirite shall be buried.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Tavi raised a contradiction before Rav Naḥman: We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>the hair of a nazirite shall be buried; but</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:3): <b>One who weaves one <i>sit</i>,</b> the distance between one’s index and middle fingers, <b>of the wool of a firstborn</b> animal, from which deriving benefit is prohibited in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of all sacrificial animals, <b>in a garment, the garment shall be ignited.</b> Similarly, if one weaves <b>from the hair of a nazirite, or</b> from the hair of <b>a firstborn donkey, in a sack, the sack shall be ignited.</b> |
| Orla 3:9 | diverse kinds | Kiddushin 38b:10 | <b>Nevertheless, we learned</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>diverse kinds</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): If <b>a vineyard has vegetables planted in it, and</b> there are <b>vegetables being sold outside</b> the vineyard, but there is no proof that these vegetables came from the vineyard, <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael they are <b>forbidden.</b> The reason is that as it is possible that the vegetables came from the vineyard, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in a case involving a prohibition by Torah law. <b>In Syria</b> these vegetables are <b>permitted.</b> |
| Orla 3:9 | there | Kiddushin 38b:7 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): <b>The new crop is forbidden by Torah law everywhere; <i>orla</i></b> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael according to <b>a <i>halakha</i>,</b> as the Gemara will immediately explain; <b>and diverse kinds</b> are forbidden outside the land <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> mentioned with regard to <i>orla</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is the <b>local <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., this was the practice of Jews in places where they settled. <b>Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> |
| Orla 3:9 | as we learned | Kiddushin 38b:9 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): Fruit whose status as <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain is forbidden in Eretz</b> Yisrael, and <b>it is permitted in Syria</b> with no concern about its uncertain status. <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, a Jew may <b>go down</b> into the gentile’s field <b>and purchase</b> fruit that is <i>orla</i> from the gentile, <b>provided that</b> the Jew <b>does not see him gather</b> it. |
| Orla 3:9 | by Torah law. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: But didn’t we learn | Kiddushin 39a:7 | § <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Offenders <b>are flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by Torah law. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9) that the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> which is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael by rabbinic law, whereas <b>there,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is referring <b>to</b> the <b>grafting of a tree</b> onto a different species. |
