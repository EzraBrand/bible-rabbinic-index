| i Samuel 14:27 | and dipped it in the honeycomb [ yarat hadevash ]” | Shabbat 95a:4 | The <i>baraita</i> cited above taught: With regard to <b>one who sweeps</b> the house, and <b>one who sprinkles</b> water on the floor, <b>and one who removes honeycombs,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> If he did so <b>intentionally on a Festival, he receives forty</b> lashes; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Elazar said: What is the rationale for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> His rationale is <b>as it is written:</b> “And he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand <b>and dipped it in the honeycomb [<i>yarat hadevash</i>]”</b> (i Samuel 14:27). The Gemara wonders: <b>What does a forest [<i>ya’ar</i>] have to do with honey [<i>devash</i>]? Rather,</b> it comes <b>to tell you: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a forest, one who picks from</b> a tree <b>on Shabbat is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a honeycomb, one who removes</b> honey <b>from it on Shabbat is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> |
| i Samuel 14:47 | he did them mischief” | Eruvin 53b:1 | <b>he did them mischief”</b> (i Samuel 14:47). |
| i Samuel 23:1 | that which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila, and they rob the threshing floors” | Eruvin 45a:16 | <b>Rabbi Dostai</b> of the town <b>of Biri expounded: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila, and they rob the threshing floors”</b> (i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond. |
| i Samuel 23:2 | it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila” | Eruvin 45a:17 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ke’ila was a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and the Philistines <b>came only with regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is written: “And they rob the threshing floors.” And</b> in the next verse <b>it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila”</b> (i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters. |
| i Samuel 28:19 | and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me” | Eruvin 53b:2 | The Gemara concludes the mention of Saul on a positive note. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgave him for that sin,</b> the massacre of Nov, the city of priests? <b>As it is stated</b> that the spirit of Samuel said to him: “And the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, <b>and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me”</b> (i Samuel 28:19); the phrase <b>“with me”</b> means <b>within my partition</b> together with me in heaven, i.e., on the same level as the righteous prophet Samuel. |
