| Tosefta Nedarim 1:6 | As it is taught | Nazir 32a:3 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta Nedarim</i> 1:6): With regard to <b>one who took a vow</b> of naziriteship <b>and</b> later <b>transgressed his</b> vow of <b>naziriteship</b> by drinking wine, the halakhic authorities <b>do not attend to his</b> request to dissolve his vow, nor do they let him complete his term as a nazirite by sacrificing offerings, <b>unless he counted,</b> i.e., observed, days of the <b>prohibitions</b> of naziriteship <b>for the same</b> number of <b>days in which he behaved with permissiveness</b> concerning the restrictions of a nazirite. Only after he observes the prohibitions of naziriteship for the number of days that his observance lapsed will a halakhic authority hear his request for dissolution, or allow him to bring his offerings. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Thirty days is enough for him.</b> He is required to observe additional days of naziriteship only if he transgressed his vow of naziriteship for thirty days or more. |
