| Kilayim 2:1 | raises an objection | Bava Batra94a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> or more of seeds <b>of a different kind,</b> before sowing such seeds <b>one must reduce</b> the quantity of the other kind of seeds in the mixture so as not to violate the prohibition against growing a mixture of diverse kinds (see Leviticus 19:19). The Gemara explains: It can be <b>assumed that</b> the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds is as</b> problematic as <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> a sale, as discussed <b>here, and</b> therefore, since the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to diverse kinds only that <b>one must reduce</b> the additional amount, but not that one is required to remove all the seeds of a different kind, it follows that the same is true in the case of a sale, and the seller should not have to take back all of the impurities. This contradicts Rav Huna’s ruling. |
| Kilayim 2:1 | like that which we learned | Moed Katan6a:16 | Concerning the issue of uprooting diverse kinds, the Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of another species must be mixed in with a crop in order to be considered diverse kinds that must be uprooted by these workers? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The amount is <b>like that which we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): <b>Any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains</b> |
| Kilayim 2:5 | raises a contradiction | Bava Kamma81a:6 | The Gemara further discusses Joshua’s conditions: <b>And</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>gather</b> wild <b>vegetation</b> for animal fodder in any place <b>except for</b> a field of <b>fenugreek.</b> The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> wild <b>vegetation is good for fenugreek,</b> and therefore the owner wants it to be left in his field? The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna that deals with diverse kinds (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>fenugreek that sprouted alongside</b> various <b>types of</b> wild <b>vegetation, one is not required to uproot</b> the vegetation. Although it is generally prohibited to grow different species of vegetables together in one patch, if the species have a negative impact on each other’s growth, it is not prohibited. In this case the wild vegetation may be left alongside the fenugreek because it is harmful to it, and the <i>halakhot</i> of diverse kinds do not apply in a case of this kind. |
| Kilayim 2:5 | as we learned | Menachot 15b:2 | The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, only <b>hemp and arum</b> are <b>prohibited</b> by <b>Torah</b> law to be sown in a vineyard, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:5): If <b>one’s field was sown</b> with <b>hemp and arum, he should not sow above them, as they produce</b> a yield only once every <b>three years. Other seeds are prohibited by rabbinic</b> law. Therefore, with regard to <b>this</b> person <b>who committed a transgression</b> by planting the seeds in the vineyard of another, <b>the Sages penalized him</b> and deemed his seeds prohibited, but as for <b>that</b> person <b>who did not commit a transgression,</b> i.e., the owner of the vineyard, <b>the Sages did not penalize him. But here,</b> in the case of <i>piggul</i>, which is a biblical prohibition, <b>let us say</b> such <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. |
| Kilayim 3:4 | Rabbi Meir, as it is taught | Bava Kamma100a:9 | <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kilayim</i> 3:4): If there was <b>a partition of a vineyard</b> that is adjacent to a wheat field, and <b>that</b> partition <b>broke open,</b> |
| Kilayim 4:9 | As we learned | Bava Batra82b:14 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9): <b>One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubits by sixteen cubits,</b> i.e., he leaves sixteen cubits between each row of vines, is <b>permitted to bring</b> other species of <b>seeds</b> to the empty spaces between the rows and sow them <b>there.</b> This is not considered a violation of the biblical prohibition with regard to sowing diverse crops in a vineyard, which is one of the prohibitions of diverse kinds. |
| Kilayim 4:9 | learn | Bava Batra83a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we</b> also <b>learn</b> a ruling in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> That mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> In a case of <b>one who plants his vineyard eight cubits by eight</b> cubits, i.e., he leaves eight cubits between each row of vines, it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to bring seeds to</b> the empty spaces between the rows. This ruling can be cited in support of the opinion of Rav Yosef that if there is a space of eight cubits between trees or vines they are not considered one unit. Why, then, is this mishna not brought as proof? |
| Kilayim 5:2 | As it is taught | Bava Batra102b:4 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted on</b> an area where there is <b>less than four cubits</b> of open space between the vines, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is not</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard</b> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <i>halakhot</i>, as it is overcrowded. <b>And the Rabbis say: This is</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard, and</b> the reason for this is that <b>the middle</b> vines are <b>viewed as if</b> they <b>are not</b> there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. Therefore, it is prohibited to plant other crops anywhere in that area. |
| Kilayim 5:2 | tanna’im | Bava Batra37b:6 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted on</b> an area where there is <b>less than four cubits</b> of open space between the vines, <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is <b>not</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard</b> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <i>halakhot</i>, as it is overcrowded. <b>And the Rabbis say: This is</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard, and</b> the reason for this is that <b>the middle</b> vines are <b>viewed as if</b> they <b>are not</b> there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. It follows that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, if one sold an overcrowded orchard, the middle trees would be viewed as if they were not there. Therefore, it would be considered an orchard and the buyer would acquire the land surrounding the trees. |
| Kilayim 5:2 | as we learned | Bava Batra83a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the analysis of <b>Rav Yosef</b> stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, we hear</b> about the maximum distance that the trees can be <b>scattered, and we hear</b> about the minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together.</b> The distance that the trees can be <b>scattered</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> i.e., eight cubits. The minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): <b>A vineyard that is planted</b> in consecutive rows <b>with less than four cubits</b> between the rows <b>is not</b> classified as <b>a vineyard,</b> because the rows are planted too close together. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is considered <b>a vineyard, and one views the middle</b> vines <b>as if they are not</b> there, as they are slated to be uprooted. |
| Kilayim 5:8 | reasoning, as we learned | Bava Batra156b:4 | § The mishna teaches: Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them:</b> That case was different; <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he was cursing them? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They were maintaining thorns in a vineyard</b> and did not uproot them, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:8): With regard to <b>one who maintains thorns in a vineyard, Rabbi Eliezer says: He has proscribed</b> the vineyard, rendering it forbidden due to the prohibition against diverse kinds. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only</b> growing <b>a matter,</b> i.e., a crop, <b>the like of which</b> people usually <b>maintain, proscribes</b> a vineyard and renders it forbidden. |
| Kilayim 7:1 | But didn’t we learn | Bava Batra19b:1 | <b>take root to the sides,</b> i.e., the growing roots spread sideways and cause damage to walls? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:1): With regard to <b>one who bends</b> a branch of <b>a grapevine into the ground</b> so that it strikes roots and produces a new vine, <b>if it does not have three handbreadths of earth over it he may not plant a seed above</b> it, as he would thereby transgress the prohibition of diverse kinds? |
| Kilayim 7:1 | as we learned | Bava Batra83a:9 | § <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: When one measures</b> the distance between the trees, <b>does he measure from the narrow place</b> on the trunk of the tree <b>or does he measure from the wide place? Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:1): When one comes to measure from <b>the layered branch of the vine he measures only from the second root,</b> as this is the average, not the widest part of the vine. |
| Kilayim 7:2 | as we learned | Bava Batra83a:11 | <b>Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>one who layers</b> the branches of <b>three vines</b> into the ground so that they take root while still attached to the base of the vine, <b>and their roots</b> that rise above the ground <b>are visible, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If there is</b> a distance <b>between them of four cubits to eight</b> cubits, <b>they combine</b> to form one vineyard composed of six grapevines. <b>And if not, they do not combine.</b> It can be inferred from this mishna that the different branches of a tree are considered separate entities when the trunk is covered by earth, provided the required distance between them is maintained. |
| Kilayim 7:4 | Rabbi Meir, as we learned | Bava Kamma100a:8 | <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:4): <b>One who drapes his grapevine atop another’s grain has rendered</b> them <b>forbidden</b> due to the prohibition against growing diverse kinds in a vineyard, <b>and</b> he <b>is liable</b> to pay the owner of the grain for the damage. The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <b>there too he does</b> cause damage <b>by</b> direct <b>action.</b> |
| Kilayim 7:4 | proscription? As we learned | Yevamot 83a:9 | What is this <i>halakha</i> of <b>proscription? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:4): If <b>one causes his grapevine to overshadow the grain of another, he has proscribed</b> it, rendering it forbidden as a food crop in a vineyard, <b>and he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for it,</b> i.e., he must compensate the other individual for the loss of the produce that has been rendered forbidden. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> |
| Kilayim 7:8 | Rav Shemaya bar Zeira raises an objection | Chullin 116a:4 | <b>Rav Shemaya bar Zeira raises an objection</b> to this conclusion from a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:8): If <b>one transfers a perforated pot</b> with seeds in it <b>into a vineyard, if</b> the size of the plant growing in the pot <b>increases</b> by one <b>two-hundredth</b> of its previous size, such that the permitted original plant is less than two hundred times the amount of the prohibited growth and insufficient to nullify it, the produce is <b>prohibited,</b> due to the prohibition against planting diverse kinds in a vineyard. One may infer: If it <b>increases, yes,</b> it is prohibited; but if it <b>does not increase, no,</b> it is permitted. Apparently, only the additional growth is prohibited, not the planted seeds or saplings. |
| Kilayim 8:3 | ourselves, as we learned | Bava Metzia8b:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Yehuda said to me:</b> Although I do not remember what Shmuel said, <b>let us see</b> if we can analyze this <b>ourselves, as we learned</b> in a mishna concerning the prohibition against leading animals of diverse kinds (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:3): If two animals of diverse kinds, e.g., a horse and a donkey, are harnessed to the same wagon, <b>the one leading</b> the animals <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes for transgressing the Torah prohibition: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10), <b>and the one sitting in the wagon [<i>bakaron</i>]</b> also <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Meir deems the one sitting in the wagon exempt,</b> as he did not perform any action. |
| Kilayim 8:4 | reasoning, as we learned | Chullin 79a:2 | <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. And Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to two animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse, even if the father</b> of one is <b>a donkey</b> and the father of the other is a horse, <b>they are permitted</b> to mate <b>with one another.</b> Since the mothers of both are horses, the offspring are all considered of the same species. <b>But</b> to mate animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>donkey with</b> animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse,</b> even if one animal was born from a male horse and a female donkey and the other was born from a male donkey and a female horse, is <b>prohibited,</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds. |
| Kilayim 8:6 | did we learn | Bava Kamma54b:27 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this redundancy is the source for extending the prohibition of diverse kinds, then it <b>should be prohibited even</b> for <b>a person</b> to plow together with an ox or another animal. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a person to plow and pull with any of them,</b> indicating that the prohibition relates only to animals? |
| Kilayim 8:6 | As we learned | Chullin 80a:19 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal. As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> “aurochs” (Deuteronomy 14:5) <b>is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>Forest ox [<i>turbala</i>],</b> it can be understood that the wild ox <b>is a species of domesticated animal, and Rabbi Yosei holds: From</b> the fact <b>that it is reckoned among the undomesticated animals,</b> it can be derived that <b>it is a species of undomesticated animal. But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> forest goats, which are not reckoned among the undomesticated animals, <b>all agree</b> that <b>they are a type of goat</b> and are fit to be sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Kilayim 8:6 | the wild ox is a species of domesticated animal, as we learned | Sanhedrin 25b:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>with regard to the wild ox,</b> which can be lured away from its owner’s property because it is not a completely domesticated animal. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>the wild ox is a species of domesticated animal, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal.</b> |
| Kilayim 9:2 | with regard to this | Bava Kamma113a:16 | The Gemara notes: <b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <b>with regard to this</b> following mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 9:2) and its attendant discussion. The customs collectors would not levy a duty for the garments one was wearing. In light of this, the mishna teaches: <b>A person may not wear</b> a garment made of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., a combination of wool and linen, <b>even</b> if he wears it <b>on top of ten garments,</b> in order <b>to avoid</b> paying <b>customs.</b> It was noted that this <b>mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is prohibited to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> by wearing a garment of diverse kinds. <b>Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: It is permitted to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> in this manner. |
| Kilayim 9:2 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 41a:2 | <b>And we discussed it: What</b> is meant by: <b>And so too with regard to diverse kinds? If we say</b> that it means: <b>And so too with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds,</b> that if a minor could not cover the majority of his head and body with it, the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply, that is difficult: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 9:2): <b>There is no</b> exemption <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> for clothing that an adult would not wear even <b>occasionally</b> in public? |
