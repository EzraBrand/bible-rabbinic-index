| Ohalot 7:3 | but didn’t we learn | Beitzah 10a:14 | <b>And if you say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel do not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation,</b> i.e., they reject the idea that a person’s original intention can be clarified retroactively, and therefore it cannot be said that the fledglings one takes on the Festival were the ones he had in mind beforehand, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ohalot</i> 7:3): If <b>a corpse</b> is located <b>in a house, and</b> the house <b>has many entrances,</b> whether they are open or closed, not only is the inside of the house ritually impure as a tent of the dead, but <b>all</b> the entrances <b>are</b> likewise <b>ritually impure</b> and impart impurity to the vessels they contain? The reason is that the corpse might be removed via any of the entrances, and therefore they all contract impurity. |
