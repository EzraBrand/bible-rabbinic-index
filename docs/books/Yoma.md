| Yoma 2:2 | the Sages taught | Yoma 39b:10 | § The mishna states that after selecting the two lots, the High Priest <b>places</b> them <b>upon the two goats.</b> Upon placing the lot for God upon the appropriate goat, he says: For God, as a sin-offering. This is just one of the occasions on which he mentions God’s name, as <b>the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 2:2): <b>The High Priest mentions the name</b> of God <b>ten times on that day: Three</b> times <b>during the first confession; and three</b> times <b>during the second confession,</b> over the bull; <b>and three</b> times when he confesses over <b>the scapegoat</b> to Azazel; <b>and one</b> time <b>with the lots,</b> when placing the lot for God upon the goat. |
