| Exodus 1:6 | superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers, | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,</b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority,</b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Exodus 1:7 | “And the children of Israel became numerous and multiplied and were very many, | Berakhot 7a:36 | <b>And Rav Yosef taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Many”</b> means more <b>than 600,000.</b> This is learned through a verbal analogy between the words <b>many</b> and <b>many. It is written here</b> with regard to Reḥaviya’s sons: <b>“Were very many.” And it is written there</b> with regard to the Israelites in Egypt: <b>“And the children of Israel became numerous and multiplied and were very many,</b> and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7). Just as when the children of Israel were in Egypt, very many meant that there were 600,000 of them, so too the descendants of Reḥaviya were 600,000. |
| Exodus 1:7 | states: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, | Chullin 92a:11 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Jewish people, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “You plucked up a vine out of Egypt;</b> You drove out the nations and planted it” (Psalms 80:9). <b>“Three branches”; these are the three</b> pilgrimage <b>Festivals, on which the Jewish people ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>every year. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth,”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be fruitful and multiply, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,</b> and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7). |
| Exodus 1:8 | “There arose a new king over Egypt, | Eruvin 53a:8 | They also disagreed about this verse: <b>“There arose a new king over Egypt,</b> who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> He was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king, <b>and one said:</b> He was in fact the old king, but <b>his decrees were new.</b> |
| Exodus 1:8 | “And there arose a new king | Sotah 11a:6 | § The Gemara proceeds to discuss the sojourn of the Jewish people in Egypt. The verse states: <b>“And there arose a new king</b> over Egypt, who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree about the interpretation of this verse. <b>One says</b> that this means he was <b>actually a new</b> king, <b>and one says</b> that this means <b>that his decrees were transformed</b> as if he were a new king. <b>The one who says</b> that he was <b>actually a new</b> king holds that it is <b>because it is written “new.” And the one who says that his decrees were transformed</b> holds that it is <b>because it is not written: “And</b> the previous king of Egypt <b>died and</b> a new king <b>reigned.”</b> This indicates that the same king remained. According to this interpretation, the words: <b>“Who knew not Joseph”</b> (Exodus 1:8), mean <b>that he was like someone who did not know him at all.</b> Although he certainly knew Joseph and his accomplishments, he acted as if he didn’t. |
| Exodus 1:9 | “And he said to his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel | Sotah 11a:7 | The next verse states: <b>“And he said to his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel</b> are too many and too mighty for us” (Exodus 1:9). It was <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:11): <b>He,</b> Pharaoh, <b>initiated the proposal. Therefore,</b> of his people, <b>he was stricken first. He initiated the proposal, as it is written: “And he said to his people.” Therefore, he was stricken first, as it is written:</b> “And the frogs shall come up <b>both upon you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants”</b> (Exodus 7:29). |
| Exodus 1:10 | and fight against us, and get him up out of the land” | Sotah 11a:14 | The verse states: “Come, let us deal wisely with him, lest he multiply, and it come to pass that when there befalls us any war, he will also join our enemies, <b>and fight against us, and get him up out of the land”</b> (Exodus 1:10). The Gemara comments: <b>He should have</b> said: <b>And get us up,</b> as Pharaoh’s fear was that the Jewish people would join the enemies of Egypt and drive Pharaoh and the Egyptians out of Egypt. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana says:</b> By stating this, Pharaoh <b>is like a person who curses himself</b> but <b>applies his curse to another.</b> |
| Exodus 1:10 | “Come, let us deal wisely with him [ lo ], | Sotah 11a:8 | The next verse states that Pharaoh said: <b>“Come, let us deal wisely with him [<i>lo</i>],</b> lest he multiply, and it come to pass that when there befalls us any war, he will also join our enemies, and fight against us” (Exodus 1:10). The Gemara comments: <b>He should have</b> said in plural: <b>With them [<i>lahem</i>],</b> rather than the singular: “With him.” <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> that Pharaoh was saying: <b>Come, let us deal wisely with regard to the savior of Israel,</b> referring to God. |
| Exodus 1:11 | “Therefore they did set over him taskmasters | Sotah 11a:15 | The next verse states: <b>“Therefore they did set over him taskmasters</b> in order to afflict him with their burdens” (Exodus 1:11). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>Over them,</b> in the plural. <b>The school of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, taught:</b> This <b>teaches</b> that at first <b>they brought a brick mold and they hung it on the neck of Pharaoh</b> to create the appearance that he was also participating in the labor. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>each and every Jew who said to</b> the Egyptians: <b>I am a delicate person [<i>istenis</i>]</b> and I cannot participate in the labor, <b>they said to him: Are you at all more of a delicate person than Pharaoh,</b> and he is participating. Therefore, the verse states: “They did set over him,” as they first placed the burden on Pharaoh as an artifice to enslave the Jewish people. |
| Exodus 1:11 | “And they built for Pharaoh storage cities [ miskenot ], | Sotah 11a:18 | The verse concludes: <b>“And they built for Pharaoh storage cities [<i>miskenot</i>],</b> Pithom and Raamses” (Exodus 1:11). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the precise interpretation of the word miskenot. <b>One says</b> that they are called this because they were the type of structures <b>that endanger [<i>mesakenot</i>] their owners,</b> as it is dangerous to work in cities with tall buildings. <b>And one says</b> that they are called this because this is the type of property <b>that impoverishes [<i>memaskenot</i>] their owners, as the Master said: All who engage in construction become poor.</b> |
| Exodus 1:11 | “Pithom and Raamses” | Sotah 11a:19 | The verse states that the names of the cities they built were <b>“Pithom and Raamses”</b> (Exodus 1:11). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the precise interpretation of this verse, both assuming that only one city was built, which had primary and secondary names. <b>One says</b> that <b>Pithom</b> was <b>its</b> real <b>name, and why was it called Raamses?</b> It is an appellation indicating <b>that</b> as the buildings were constructed <b>they collapsed [<i>mitroses</i>] one by one</b> and needed to be rebuilt. <b>And one says</b> that <b>Raamses</b> was <b>its</b> real <b>name, and why was it called Pithom?</b> Because <b>the opening of the abyss [<i>pi tehom</i>] swallowed</b> each building they constructed <b>one by one, and it sunk into the ground.</b> |
| Exodus 1:12 | “But the more they afflicted him, the more he would multiply and the more he would spread about” | Sotah 11a:20 | The next verse states: <b>“But the more they afflicted him, the more he would multiply and the more he would spread about”</b> (Exodus 1:12). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>The more they multiplied and the more they spread about,</b> in the past tense. <b>Reish Lakish says: Divine inspiration proclaimed to</b> the Egyptians: As long as this nation is afflicted, <b>the more he will multiply and the more he will spread about.</b> As the verse states: <b>“And they became disgusted [<i>vayyakutzu</i>] due to the children of Israel.”</b> The Gemara explains: This <b>teaches that</b> the Jewish people <b>appeared in their eyes like thorns [<i>kotzim</i>].</b> |
| Exodus 1:13 | with rigor [ befarekh ]” | Sotah 11b:1 | <b>with rigor [<i>befarekh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 1:13). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The word <i>befarekh</i> is a conjugation of the words: <b>With a soft mouth [<i>bifeh rakh</i>],</b> as the Egyptians enticed the Jewish people into slavery, gradually subjugating them until they had lost their freedom completely. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <i>befarekh</i> should be understood as: <b>With crushing [<i>bifrikha</i>],</b> as the Egyptians subjugated Israel with backbreaking labor. |
| Exodus 1:14 | because the Egyptians embittered our forefathers’ lives in Egypt, as it is stated: “And they embittered their lives | Pesachim 116b:2 | Rabban Gamliel continues to explain: The reason for <b><i>matza</i></b> is <b>because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “And they baked the dough that they took out of Egypt</b> as cakes of <i>matzot</i>, for it was not leavened, as they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual” (Exodus 12:39). The reason for <b>bitter herbs</b> is <b>because the Egyptians embittered our forefathers’ lives in Egypt, as it is stated: “And they embittered their lives</b> with hard service, in mortar and in brick; in all manner of service in the field, all the service that they made them serve was with rigor” (Exodus 1:14). |
| Exodus 1:14 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why are the Egyptians likened to bitter herbs | Pesachim 39a:10 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>lettuce [<i>ḥassa</i>]?</b> It refers to the fact <b>that God has mercy [<i>ḥas</i>] on us. And Rabbi Samuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why are the Egyptians likened to bitter herbs</b> in the verse: “And they embittered their lives” (Exodus 1:14)? This comparison serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as these bitter herbs are soft at first and harsh in the end, so too, the Egyptians were soft at first,</b> when they paid the Jews for their work, <b>but were harsh in the end,</b> as they enslaved them. This idea applies solely to <b><i>ḥazeret</i>,</b> which has a bitter aftertaste, but not to other types of bitter herbs, which are bitter from the beginning. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>I retract</b> my position and concede that it is preferable to use <i>ḥazeret</i> for bitter herbs. |
| Exodus 1:14 | “And they made their lives bitter through hard service, with mortar and brick, | Sotah 11b:2 | The next verse states: <b>“And they made their lives bitter through hard service, with mortar and brick,</b> and with every laborious service in the field” (Exodus 1:14). <b>Rava says:</b> The verse mentions specifically mortar and brick and then all forms of labor, as <b>initially</b> the Egyptians had them work <b>with mortar and bricks, and ultimately</b> they subjugated them <b>“and with every laborious service in the field.”</b> |
| Exodus 1:14 | “In all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor” | Sotah 11b:3 | The verse concludes: <b>“In all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor”</b> (Exodus 1:14). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The meaning of <i>befarekh</i> is that the Egyptians <b>would exchange</b> the responsibilities of men and women, giving <b>men’s work to women and women’s work to men,</b> requiring everyone to do work to which they were unaccustomed. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>there,</b> in the previous verse, <i>bifarekh</i> indicates that the Egyptians enslaved the Jews <b>with a soft mouth, here,</b> in this verse, which describes the physical hardship of the labor, the word befarekh <b>certainly</b> means <b>with crushing</b> labor. |
| Exodus 1:15 | “And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, | Sotah 11b:11 | § The verse states: <b>“And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives,</b> of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah” (Exodus 1:15). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the proper interpretation of this verse. <b>One says</b> that these midwives were <b>a woman and her daughter, and one says</b> that they were <b>a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.</b> According to the <b>one who says</b> that they were <b>a woman and her daughter,</b> the women were <b>Jochebed,</b> the mother of Moses and Aaron, <b>and</b> her daughter, <b>Miriam. And</b> according to the <b>one who says</b> that they were <b>a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law,</b> the verse is referring to <b>Jochebed and</b> her daughter-in-law <b>Elisheba,</b> the wife of Aaron. |
| Exodus 1:16 | “And he said: When you deliver the Hebrew women, | Sotah 11b:14 | The next verse relates the instructions of Pharaoh to the midwives: <b>“And he said: When you deliver the Hebrew women,</b> and you look upon the stones [<i>ovnayim</i>], if it be a son, then you shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“stones”? Rabbi Ḥanan says:</b> Pharaoh <b>transmitted a great sign to them. He said to them: At the time</b> when a woman <b>crouches to give birth, her thighs become as cold as stones,</b> and, therefore, this shall be for you a sign that the woman is about to give birth. |
| Exodus 1:16 | “If it be a son, then you shall kill him; | Sotah 11b:16 | The verse continues: <b>“If it be a son, then you shall kill him;</b> but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Pharaoh <b>transmitted to them a great sign</b> to enable them to know the gender of the infant from the beginning of the birth process: <b>A boy</b> is born with <b>his face downward; a girl</b> is born with <b>her face upward.</b> Pharaoh provided them with this sign so that they could kill the boys secretly even before the mother realized what was happening. |
| Exodus 1:16 | If it be a son, then you shall kill him; | Sotah 12a:8 | § The Gemara returns to the discussion of the bondage in Egypt. <b>“And Pharaoh charged all his people,</b> saying: Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive” (Exodus 1:22). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The use of the phrase “every son that is born” indicates that <b>he decreed even on his own nation</b> that all their male babies must be killed. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> further: <b>He decreed three decrees. Initially,</b> he commanded the midwives only with regard to Jewish infants: “You shall look upon the stones. <b>If it be a son, then you shall kill him;</b> but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). <b>And afterward,</b> he decreed with regard to the Jewish infants: <b>“Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22). <b>And ultimately, he decreed even on his own nation</b> that Egyptian infant boys should be cast into the river as well. |
| Exodus 1:17 | “But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke about them [ aleihen ], | Sotah 11b:17 | The next verse states: <b>“But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke about them [<i>aleihen</i>],</b> but they kept the male children alive” (Exodus 1:17). The Gemara comments: <b>It should have</b> stated: “Spoke <b>to them [<i>lahen</i>].” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Pharaoh <b>proposed to them to</b> engage in <b>a sinful act,</b> i.e., sexual intercourse, with him, <b>but they did not accept</b> his overtures. The word <i>aleihen</i> is often used in reference to sexual intercourse, for example: “And brought her to him; and he consorted with her [<i>eileha</i>]” (Genesis 29:23), and that is its connotation here as well. |
| Exodus 1:17 | “But they kept the male children alive” | Sotah 11b:18 | The verse concludes: <b>“But they kept the male children alive”</b> (Exodus 1:17). A Sage <b>teaches:</b> It is <b>not only that they did not kill</b> the children as Pharaoh had commanded them, <b>but that they would</b> even <b>provide for them water and food,</b> as the phrase “But they kept the male children alive” indicates. |
| Exodus 1:19 | women, | Sotah 11b:19 | After being questioned by Pharaoh concerning their failure to obey his command, the midwives responded, as it is written: <b>“And the midwives said to Pharaoh: Because</b> the Hebrew women <b>are not as the</b> Egyptian <b>women,</b> for they are lively [<i>ḥayot</i>], and are delivered before the midwife comes to them” (Exodus 1:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>ḥayot</i>”? If we say</b> that the Hebrew women are like <i>ḥayot</i>, meaning <b>actual midwives</b> for themselves, and therefore they do not need assistance from others, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>a midwife does not need</b> the assistance of <b>another midwife</b> in order <b>to help her give birth?</b> |
| Exodus 1:21 | “And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses” | Sotah 11b:22 | The verse relates the midwives’ reward: <b>“And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses”</b> (Exodus 1:21). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the precise interpretation of these houses: <b>One says</b> that God made <b>the houses of</b> the <b>priesthood and</b> the <b>Levites</b> descend from the midwives, <b>and one says</b> that God made the <b>houses of royalty</b> descend from them. <b>The one who says</b> that it is referring to the <b>houses of</b> the <b>priesthood and</b> the <b>Levites</b> is referring to <b>Aaron and Moses,</b> who were sons of Jochebed. <b>And the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>houses of royalty</b> is referring to <b>David,</b> who <b>also comes from Miriam, as it is written: “And Azubah,” the wife of Caleb, “died, and Caleb took to him Ephrath, who bore him Hur”</b> (I Chronicles 2:19) and, as will be explained further, Ephrath is Miriam. <b>And it is written: “David was the son of that Ephrathite</b> of Bethlehem in Judah” (I Samuel 17:12). Therefore, he was a descendant of Miriam. |
| Exodus 1:22 | said: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river” | Sanhedrin 101b:10 | <b>The astrologers of Pharaoh</b> saw and were mistaken, <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “These are the waters of contention”</b> (Numbers 20:13)? <b>These are</b> the waters <b>that the astrologers of Pharaoh saw, and they erred</b> concerning them. As <b>they saw</b> in the stars <b>that the savior of Israel would be stricken by water,</b> Pharaoh <b>said: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22), assuming that any potential savior would be drowned. <b>And they did not know that</b> it was <b>over matters</b> involving <b>the waters of Meribah</b> that Moses would be <b>stricken</b> and would not be allowed to enter Eretz Yisrael. |
| Exodus 1:22 | was the great man of his generation. Once he saw that the wicked Pharaoh said: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, | Sotah 12a:10 | A Sage <b>teaches: Amram,</b> the father of Moses, <b>was the great man of his generation. Once he saw that the wicked Pharaoh said: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river,</b> and every daughter you shall save alive” (Exodus 1:22), <b>he said: We are laboring for nothing</b> by bringing children into the world to be killed. Therefore, <b>he arose and divorced his wife. All</b> others who saw this followed his example and <b>arose and divorced their wives.</b> |
| Exodus 1:22 | “And Pharaoh charged all his people, | Sotah 12a:8 | § The Gemara returns to the discussion of the bondage in Egypt. <b>“And Pharaoh charged all his people,</b> saying: Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive” (Exodus 1:22). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The use of the phrase “every son that is born” indicates that <b>he decreed even on his own nation</b> that all their male babies must be killed. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> further: <b>He decreed three decrees. Initially,</b> he commanded the midwives only with regard to Jewish infants: “You shall look upon the stones. <b>If it be a son, then you shall kill him;</b> but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). <b>And afterward,</b> he decreed with regard to the Jewish infants: <b>“Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22). <b>And ultimately, he decreed even on his own nation</b> that Egyptian infant boys should be cast into the river as well. |
| Exodus 1:22 | they arose and decreed: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river” | Sotah 12b:13 | The Gemara applies this to Pharaoh: Pharaoh’s astrologers <b>saw that the savior of the Jewish people would be stricken by water.</b> Therefore, <b>they arose and decreed: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22); they thought that their vision indicated that Moses would be killed in the water. <b>Once</b> Jochebed <b>cast Moses</b> into the water, although he was protected in an ark, the astrologers <b>said: We no longer see</b> in the stars anything <b>like that sign</b> we saw as to the downfall of the leader of the Jews by water, and therefore at that moment <b>they canceled their decree. But they did not know that</b> what they saw foretold that Moses <b>would be stricken on account of the waters of Meribah.</b> They envisioned a downfall for Moses by water but didn’t fully comprehend their vision. |
| Exodus 2:1 | Jochebed. As it is written: “And a man of the house of Levi went, and took as a wife a daughter of Levi” | Bava Batra119b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> If a woman <b>marries</b> when she is <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>sixty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>twenty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>forty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>forty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is <b>no longer</b> able to <b>give birth</b> at all. If so, how could Zelophehad’s daughters have waited until the age of forty to marry? <b>Rather, since they are righteous women, a miracle was performed for them, like</b> the one done for <b>Jochebed. As it is written: “And a man of the house of Levi went, and took as a wife a daughter of Levi”</b> (Exodus 2:1). |
| Exodus 2:1 | and took | Bava Batra120a:3 | The verse concerning Amram’s marriage to Jochebed states: “And a man of the house of Levi went, <b>and took</b> as a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Since Jochebed had already been married to Amram for some years, as Miriam and Aaron were already born, the verse <b>should have</b> stated: <b>And</b> he <b>took back</b> as a wife. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says:</b> The wording of the verse <b>teaches that</b> Amram <b>performed for her</b> a formal <b>act of marriage</b> as though he were marrying her for the first time. He <b>seated her in</b> a bridal <b>palanquin [<i>be’appiryon</i>], and Aaron and Miriam</b> were <b>singing before her, and</b> the <b>ministering angels</b> were <b>saying: “A joyful mother of children”</b> (Psalms 113:9). |
| Exodus 2:1 | “And took | Sotah 12a:13 | The Gemara asks: If Amram remarried Jochebed, rather than say: <b>“And took</b> for a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1), <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>“And returned</b> for a wife the daughter of Levi.” <b>Rav Yehuda bar Zevina says: He performed an act of marriage</b> just as one would do for a first marriage. <b>He sat her on a palanquin [<i>appiryon</i>], and Aaron and Miriam danced before her, and the ministering angels said: “A joyful mother of children”</b> (Psalms 113:9). |
| Exodus 2:1 | “a daughter of Levi” | Sotah 12a:14 | The verse is referring to Jochebed as <b>“a daughter of Levi”</b> (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that this is Jochebed? Jochebed <b>was</b> then <b>130 years old and</b> the verse still <b>calls her a daughter?</b> Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The “daughter of Levi” <b>is Jochebed, whose conception was on the road,</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born between the walls,</b> i.e., in Egypt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59). |
| Exodus 2:1 | “And there went a man of the house of Levi, | Sotah 12a:9 | The verse states: <b>“And there went a man of the house of Levi,</b> and took for a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: <b>To where did he go? Rav Yehuda bar Zevina says: He went according to the advice of his daughter</b> Miriam, as the Gemara will proceed to explain. |
| Exodus 2:2 | “And when she saw him that he was a goodly child” | Menachot 53b:3 | Rabbi Ezra stated another, similar homily: <b>Let the good one come and receive the good from the Good for the good ones.</b> He explained: <b>Let the good one come; this</b> good <b>is Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“And when she saw him that he was a goodly child”</b> (Exodus 2:2). <b>And receive the good; this</b> good <b>is</b> the <b>Torah, as it is written</b> about the Torah: <b>“For I give you a good doctrine;</b> do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2). <b>From the Good; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord is good to all”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>For the good ones; these</b> good ones <b>are the Jews, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“Do good, Lord, to the good ones”</b> (Psalms 125:4). |
| Exodus 2:2 | “And the woman conceived, and bore a son; | Sotah 12a:16 | § The verse states concerning Moses: <b>“And the woman conceived, and bore a son;</b> and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months” (Exodus 2:2). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Jochebed <b>was pregnant with</b> Moses <b>for three months at the outset,</b> before Amram remarried her, as will be explained further. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Zevina said:</b> The intention of the verse is to <b>juxtapose her</b> giving <b>birth to her becoming pregnant. Just as her becoming pregnant was without pain, so too, her</b> giving <b>birth was without pain. From here</b> it is derived <b>concerning righteous women that they were not included in the verdict [<i>pitkah</i>] of Eve</b> that a woman will suffer pain during childbirth (see Genesis 3:16). |
| Exodus 2:2 | and when she saw him that he was a goodly [ tov ] child, | Sotah 12a:17 | The verse states with regard to the birth of Moses: “And the woman conceived, and bore a son; <b>and when she saw him that he was a goodly [<i>tov</i>] child,</b> she hid him three months” (Exodus 2:2). It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: “Tov” is his,</b> Moses’, real <b>name,</b> as it was given to him by his parents when he was born. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: His name was Toviya. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> They said he was good because they saw that he was <b>fit for prophecy. Others say:</b> They said he was good because he was <b>born when he was</b> already <b>circumcised. And the Rabbis say: At the time when Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And when she saw him that he was a goodly [<i>tov</i>] child,” and it is written there: “And God saw the light, that it was good [<i>tov</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:4). |
| Exodus 2:2 | “And she hid him three months” | Sotah 12a:18 | The verse continues: <b>“And she hid him three months”</b> (Exodus 2:2). The Gemara explains that she was able to hide him for three months <b>because the Egyptians counted</b> the nine months of her pregnancy <b>only from the time</b> her husband <b>took her back, but she was pregnant with</b> Moses <b>for three months from the outset</b> of her remarriage. |
| Exodus 2:3 | “And when she could no longer hide him” | Sotah 12a:19 | The next verse states: <b>“And when she could no longer hide him”</b> (Exodus 2:3). The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> couldn’t she hide him any longer? <b>Let her continue to hide him. Rather, anywhere that the Egyptians heard that a baby was born</b> and they wanted to locate the baby, <b>they would bring</b> another <b>baby there in order that it could be heard</b> crying, <b>and</b> the two babies <b>would cry together, as it is written: “Take us the foxes, the little foxes,</b> that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom” (Song of Songs 2:15). The infants who were used to uncover the hidden babies are referred to as little foxes. |
| Exodus 2:3 | she took for him an ark of bulrushes, | Sotah 12a:20 | The verse states: “And when she could no longer hide him, <b>she took for him an ark of bulrushes,</b> and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the willows by the river’s bank” (Exodus 2:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>bulrushes</b> that she decided to use them? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From here</b> it is derived <b>concerning righteous people that their money is more precious to them than their bodies,</b> as she took an inexpensive material to build the ark. <b>And why</b> do they care <b>so much</b> about their money? <b>Because they do not stretch out their hands to</b> partake of <b>stolen property.</b> Therefore, their own property is very precious to them. |
| Exodus 2:3 | “And daubed it with bitumen and with pitch” | Sotah 12a:22 | The verse continues: <b>“And daubed it with bitumen and with pitch”</b> (Exodus 2:3). A Sage <b>teaches:</b> She daubed <b>bitumen on the interior and pitch on the exterior, so that righteous person,</b> i.e., Moses, <b>would not smell a foul odor,</b> such as that of pitch. |
| Exodus 2:3 | “And she put the child therein, and laid it in the willows [ bassuf ]” | Sotah 12a:23 | The verse continues: <b>“And she put the child therein, and laid it in the willows [<i>bassuf</i>]”</b> (Exodus 2:3). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This means she placed him <b>in the Suf Sea,</b> i.e., the Red Sea. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> |
| Exodus 2:4 | “And his sister stood afar off, | Sotah 11a:5 | With regard to Miriam’s deed the verse states: <b>“And his sister stood afar off,</b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: This entire verse is stated in reference to the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., each phrase alludes to the Divine Presence watching over Moses. <b>“And</b> his sister <b>stood”; as it is written: “And the Lord came, and stood”</b> (I Samuel 3:10). <b>“His sister”; as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>“Afar off”; as it is written: “From afar the Lord appeared to me”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2). <b>“To know”; as it is written: “For the Lord is a God of knowledge”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>“What”; as it is written: “What does the Lord God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). <b>“Would be done”; as it is written: “For the Lord God will do nothing”</b> (Amos 3:7). <b>“To him”; as it is written: “And the Lord said to him: Peace</b> be with you” (Judges 6:23). |
| Exodus 2:4 | would say: In the future, my mother will give birth to a son who will save the Jewish people. And once Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light. Her father arose and kissed her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled. And once they put him into the river, her father arose and hit her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, where is your prophecy? And this is as it is written: “And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him” | Sotah 13a:1 | <b>And</b> as a child Miriam <b>would say: In the future, my mother will give birth to a son who will save the Jewish people. And once Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light. Her father arose and kissed her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled. And once they put him into the river, her father arose and hit her on her head. He said to her: My daughter, where is your prophecy? And this is as it is written: “And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him”</b> (Exodus 2:4), i.e., <b>to know what will be the ultimate</b> resolution <b>of her prophecy.</b> |
| Exodus 2:4 | as it is stated: “And his sister stood afar off, | Sotah 9b:8 | The mishna continues: <b>And the same</b> is so <b>with regard to the</b> reward of <b>good</b> deeds; a person is rewarded measure for measure. <b>Miriam waited for</b> the baby <b>Moses</b> for <b>one hour</b> at the shore of the Nile, <b>as it is stated: “And his sister stood afar off,</b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>Therefore the Jewish people delayed</b> their travels in the desert for <b>seven days</b> to wait <b>for her</b> when she was smitten with leprosy, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Miriam was confined outside of the camp seven days; <b>and the people journeyed not until Miriam was brought in again”</b> (Numbers 12:15). |
| Exodus 2:5 | referred to as Yehudiyya ? Because she repudiated idol worship, as it is written: “And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself in the river” | Megillah 13a:4 | <b>Why is she,</b> who we are told at the end of the verse was Pharaoh’s daughter Bithiah, <b>referred to as <i>Yehudiyya</i>? Because she repudiated idol worship, as it is written: “And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself in the river”</b> (Exodus 2:5), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She went down to wash</b> and purify <b>herself from the idols of her father’s house.</b> |
| Exodus 2:5 | “And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe [ lirḥotz ] in the river” | Sotah 12b:2 | The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe [<i>lirḥotz</i>] in the river”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that she came down</b> to the river <b>to cleanse</b> herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>her father’s idols,</b> as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process. <b>And similarly it states: “When the Lord shall have washed [<i>raḥatz</i>] away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</b> and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction” (Isaiah 4:4). This washing clearly refers to the purging of spiritual sins, rather than bathing for the sake of cleanliness. |
| Exodus 2:5 | [ holekhot ] | Sotah 12b:3 | The verse continues: <b>“And her maidens walked</b> along <b>[<i>holekhot</i>]</b> by the riverside” (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This walking</b> is <b>nothing other</b> than the <b>terminology of</b> going toward <b>death, and similarly it states: “Behold, I am going [<i>holekh</i>] to die”</b> (Genesis 25:32). |
| Exodus 2:5 | “And she saw the ark among the willows” | Sotah 12b:4 | The verse continues: <b>“And she saw the ark among the willows”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Once</b> her maidens <b>saw that</b> the daughter of Pharaoh <b>was intending to save Moses, they said to her: Our mistress, the custom of the world</b> is that when <b>a king of flesh and blood decrees a decree,</b> even <b>if all the world does not fulfill it,</b> at least <b>his children and members of his household fulfill it, and</b> yet <b>you are violating the decree of your father.</b> After the maidens tried to convince her not to save Moses, the angel <b>Gabriel came and beat them to the ground</b> and they died. |
| Exodus 2:5 | “And she sent amatah to take it” | Sotah 12b:5 | The verse concludes: <b>“And she sent <i>amatah</i> to take it”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagree as to the definition of the word “<i>amatah</i>.” <b>One says</b> that it means <b>her arm, and one says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who says</b> that it means <b>her arm</b> explained it in this manner, <b>as it is written “<i>amatah</i>,”</b> which denotes her forearm. <b>And the one who says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant</b> explained it in this manner <b>because it does not</b> explicitly <b>write</b> the more common term: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>].</b> Therefore, he understands that this is the alternative term for a maidservant, <i>ama</i>. |
| Exodus 2:6 | “And she had compassion on him, and said: This [ zeh ] is one of the Hebrews’ children” | Sotah 12b:10 | The verse concludes: <b>“And she had compassion on him, and said: This [<i>zeh</i>] is one of the Hebrews’ children”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara asks: <b>From where did she know</b> that he was a Hebrew child? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: As she saw</b> that <b>he was circumcised.</b> |
| Exodus 2:6 | “This [ zeh ] | Sotah 12b:11 | The Gemara comments: The Pharaoh’s daughter said: <b>“This [<i>zeh</i>]</b> is one of the Hebrews’ children” (Exodus 2:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that she prophesied unknowingly,</b> as the intention of the word “<i>zeh</i>” was: <b>This</b> one <b>falls,</b> i.e., is cast, into the water, <b>but no other</b> will <b>fall</b> by means of water, for on that day Pharaoh’s decree was canceled. |
| Exodus 2:6 | “And she opened it and saw it [ vatirehu ], even the child” | Sotah 12b:8 | The next verse states: <b>“And she opened it and saw it [<i>vatirehu</i>], even the child”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara comments: The verse states: “And she saw it”; <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>And she saw. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> In addition to Moses, <b>she saw the Divine Presence with him.</b> This is indicated by the usage of “saw it.” |
| Exodus 2:6 | and behold a lad [ na’ar ] that wept” | Sotah 12b:9 | The verse states: “And saw it, even the child [<i>yeled</i>]; <b>and behold a lad [<i>na’ar</i>] that wept”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The verse <b>calls him “a child [<i>yeled</i>],” and</b> the same verse <b>calls him “a lad [<i>na’ar</i>].”</b> A Sage <b>teaches: He is</b> the age of <b>a child but his voice</b> is as loud and deep <b>as a lad;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: If</b> that is <b>so, you made Moses our teacher blemished,</b> since his voice was unusually deep. <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that his mother made a canopy of youth,</b> i.e., a small canopy, <b>for him in the ark,</b> as <b>she said: Perhaps I will not merit to</b> see <b>his</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b> |
| Exodus 2:7 | “Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, | Sotah 12b:19 | The Gemara now discusses the next verse in Exodus: <b>“Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women,</b> that she may nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> that Pharaoh’s daughter would specifically want a nurse <b>of the Hebrew women?</b> |
| Exodus 2:8 | “And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Go. | Sotah 12b:21 | The next verse states: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Go.</b> And the maiden [<i>ha’alma</i>] went and called the child’s mother” (Exodus 2:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This <b>teaches that she went quickly like a maiden,</b> i.e., with the strength of one of marriageable age, and not as the young child that she was. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <b><i>ha’alma</i></b> is related to the word meaning to hide [<i>le’alem</i>], <b>for she hid her words</b> and didn’t tell Pharaoh’s daughter that she was bringing the baby’s mother. |
| Exodus 2:9 | “And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take this [ heilikhi ] child away, | Sotah 12b:22 | The next verse states what Pharaoh’s daughter said to Jochebed: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take this [<i>heilikhi</i>] child away,</b> and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it” (Exodus 2:9). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> Pharaoh’s daughter <b>is prophesying and she does not know what she is prophesying,</b> as the word <b><i>heilikhi</i></b> means: <b>This is yours [<i>ha shellikhi</i>],</b> i.e., this is your child. The next part of the verse states: <b>“And I will give you your wages.” Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This teaches that <b>with regard to righteous people, not only</b> is it so <b>that</b> God arranges <b>that their lost items are returned to them, but</b> He <b>also</b> arranges <b>that they get their wages,</b> as the son of Jochebed was returned to her and she also received payment for nursing him. |
| Exodus 2:12 | “And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian | Sanhedrin 58b:17 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: A gentile who struck a Jew is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>as it is stated</b> when Moses saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew: <b>“And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian</b> and hid him in the sand” (Exodus 2:12). |
| Exodus 2:13 | striving | Nedarim 64b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is their reason</b> for not accepting this proof? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold: These</b> people who were seeking Moses’ life, <b>had they</b> indeed <b>died? But Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Wherever it is stated</b> in the Torah the term <b>striving</b> (Exodus 2:13), in reference to the men who slandered Moses, <b>or standing</b> (Exodus 5:20), in reference to those who complained against Moses and Aaron, <b>they are none other than Dathan and Abiram.</b> Dathan and Abiram were alive during the rebellion of Korah, which occurred years later, so they could not have been dead when God instructed Moses to return to Egypt. <b>Rather, Reish Lakish said:</b> They did not literally die, but the verse means <b>that they lost their property</b> and their status in the community, which meant their opinions were no longer granted credibility, and consequently, Moses could safely return to Egypt. Such a turn of events is not considered to be a new circumstance. |
| Exodus 2:13 | and he said to the wicked one: Why should you strike your friend?” | Sanhedrin 58b:19 | The Gemara states <b>a mnemonic</b> for the upcoming statements of Reish Lakish: <b>Raises, his slave, Shabbat. Reish Lakish says: One who raises his hand to</b> strike <b>another, even if he</b> ultimately <b>does not strike him, is called wicked, as it is stated:</b> “And two men of the Hebrews were struggling with each other, <b>and he said to the wicked one: Why should you strike your friend?”</b> (Exodus 2:13). The phrase: <b>Why did you strike, is not stated,</b> but <b>rather: “Why should you strike,”</b> indicating that one who raised his hand to strike another, <b>even if he</b> ultimately <b>did not strike him, is called wicked.</b> |
| Exodus 2:20 | “Call him, that he may eat bread” | Sanhedrin 104a:2 | <b>And</b> the fact that it <b>draws near the distant</b> is derived <b>from Yitro, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In reward</b> for Yitro telling his daughters: <b>“Call him, that he may eat bread”</b> (Exodus 2:20), inviting Moses to join them for a meal, Yitro’s <b>descendants were privileged and sat</b> as scribes in session with the Sanhedrin <b>in the Chamber of Hewn Stone. As it is stated: “And the families of the scribes who dwelt in Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Sucathites. These were the Kenites who came of Hammath, father of the house of Rechab”</b> (I Chronicles 2:55). <b>And it is written there</b> with regard to the identity of the Kenites: <b>“And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of the palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people”</b> (Judges 1:16). |
| Exodus 2:21 | For it is written: “And Moses was content [ vayo’el ] | Nedarim 65a:1 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:12): With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another, they dissolve</b> the vow <b>for him only in the presence</b> of the one who is the subject of the vow. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman said: As it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). Rav Naḥman notes that the verse specifies where God spoke to Moses, and explains that God <b>said to him: In Midian you vowed</b> to Yitro that you would not return to Egypt, <b>go and dissolve your vow in Midian.</b> And where does it say that Moses vowed to Yitro? <b>For it is written: “And Moses was content [<i>vayo’el</i>]</b> to dwell with the man” (Exodus 2:21). The word <i>vayo’el</i> is related to the word <i>ala</i>, and <b><i>ala</i> means nothing other than an oath, as it is written: “And he…brought him under an oath [<i>ala</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13), and the <i>halakhot</i> of dissolution of oaths are identical to those of dissolution of vows. |
| Exodus 3:2 | fanned [ libba ] is not mistaken, as it is written: “With a flame [ belabbat ] of fire” | Bava Kamma60a:3 | Rav Naḥman explained: The <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>fanned [<i>libba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “With a flame [<i>belabbat</i>] of fire”</b> (Exodus 3:2), <b>and</b> the <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>blew [<i>nibba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “He creates the fruit [<i>niv</i>] of the lips”</b> (Isaiah 57:19), which can be interpreted as referring to the breath of the lips. |
| Exodus 3:2 | a little, and recite: “And an angel of the Lord appeared to him | Shabbat 67a:3 | On <b>the first day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little, and recite: “And an angel of the Lord appeared to him</b> in a flame of fire from within the bush and he looked and behold the bush was aflame in fire and the bush was not consumed” (Exodus 3:2). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And Moses said: I will turn aside now, and see</b> this great sight, why the bush is not burned” (Exodus 3:3). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see</b> and God called to him within the bush and said: Moses, Moses, and he said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4). |
| Exodus 3:2 | beautiful trees and rested His Divine Presence on the bush | Sotah 5a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef says: A person should always learn</b> proper behavior <b>from the wisdom of his Creator, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, disregarded all</b> of the <b>mountains and hills and rested His Divine Presence on the</b> lowly <b>Mount Sinai. And</b> similarly, when appearing to Moses, <b>He disregarded all</b> of the <b>beautiful trees and rested His Divine Presence on the bush</b> (Exodus 3:2). |
| Exodus 3:3 | and recite: “And Moses said: I will turn aside now, and see | Shabbat 67a:3 | On <b>the first day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little, and recite: “And an angel of the Lord appeared to him</b> in a flame of fire from within the bush and he looked and behold the bush was aflame in fire and the bush was not consumed” (Exodus 3:2). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And Moses said: I will turn aside now, and see</b> this great sight, why the bush is not burned” (Exodus 3:3). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see</b> and God called to him within the bush and said: Moses, Moses, and he said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4). |
| Exodus 3:4 | and recite: “And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see | Shabbat 67a:3 | On <b>the first day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little, and recite: “And an angel of the Lord appeared to him</b> in a flame of fire from within the bush and he looked and behold the bush was aflame in fire and the bush was not consumed” (Exodus 3:2). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And Moses said: I will turn aside now, and see</b> this great sight, why the bush is not burned” (Exodus 3:3). <b>On the following day, let him carve</b> the bush <b>a little</b> more <b>and recite: “And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see</b> and God called to him within the bush and said: Moses, Moses, and he said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4). |
| Exodus 3:5 | They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [ halom ]” | Bava Batra110a:3 | In connection with the Gemara’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Gemara quotes additional statements of the Sages concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <b>“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who brought you here [<i>halom</i>], and what [<i>ma</i>] are you doing in this place, and what do you have here [<i>po</i>]?”</b> (Judges 18:3). The Sages interpret their multiple questions. <b>They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [<i>halom</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:5)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [<i>ma</i>] is that in your hand”</b> (Exodus 4:2)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [<i>po</i>] with me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27)? <b>Shall you,</b> a descendant of our teacher Moses, <b>become a priest for idol worship?</b> |
| Exodus 3:5 | a shoe, which is generally not considered contemptuous, the Torah said: “Put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place upon which you stand is holy ground” | Berakhot 62b:23 | Rava <b>said to him:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> derives</b> the prohibition of spitting <b>from</b> the case of <b>a shoe, and you say</b> that it should be derived <b>from</b> the case of <b>a shortcut?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is this</b> derivation from the case of a shoe? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may neither enter the Temple Mount with his staff in his hand, nor with his shoes on his feet, nor with money tied in his cloth and with his money-belt slung behind him, nor</b> should one <b>make it a shortcut. All the more so, spitting</b> is prohibited <b><i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to wearing <b>a shoe. Just as</b> with regard to <b>a shoe, which is generally not considered contemptuous, the Torah said: “Put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place upon which you stand is holy ground”</b> (Exodus 3:5), <b>all the more so spitting, which is considered contemptuous,</b> should be prohibited. |
| Exodus 3:5 | Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And let him say: “And the Lord said: Do not come close, | Shabbat 67a:4 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And let him say: “And the Lord said: Do not come close,</b> take off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). This verse is more suited to be recited as an incantation to cure a fever. <b>Rather, on the first day, let him recite</b> the first two verses: <b>“And an angel of the Lord appeared to him</b> in a flame of fire from within the bush and he looked and behold the bush was aflame in fire and the bush was not consumed,” as well as, <b>“And Moses said:</b> I will turn aside now and see.” <b>And on the following day, let him recite: “And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see.” And on the following day,</b> let him recite: <b>“And the Lord said: Do not come close,</b> take off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). |
| Exodus 3:5 | kingship, but it was not given to him, as it is written: “Do not draw hither” | Zevachim 102a:14 | The Gemara continues to discuss the roles of Moses: <b>Ulla says: Moses requested</b> that he be given the <b>kingship, but it was not given to him, as it is written: “Do not draw hither”</b> (Exodus 3:5); <b>and</b> the word <b>“hither”</b> refers to <b>nothing other than kingship, as it is stated:</b> “Then David the king went in and sat before the Lord, and he said: <b>Who am I, O Lord God,</b> and what is my house, <b>that You have brought me hither”?</b> (II Samuel 7:18). |
| Exodus 3:6 | you did not want | Berakhot 7a:30 | The Gemara continues to cite the Sages’ explanation of verses that require clarification on the same topic. With regard to God’s statement to Moses, <b>“And He said: ‘You cannot see My face,</b> for man shall not see Me and live’” (Exodus 33:20), <b>it was taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses <b>as follows: When I wanted</b> to show you My glory at the burning bush, <b>you did not want</b> to see it, as it is stated: “And Moses concealed his face, fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6). But <b>now that you want</b> to see My glory, as you said: “Show me Your glory,” <b>I do not want</b> to show it to you. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa interprets Moses’ initial refusal to look upon God’s glory negatively, as he rebuffed God’s desire to be close to him. |
| Exodus 3:6 | concealed his face, | Berakhot 7a:32 | Because “Moses <b>concealed his face,</b> fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6), <b>he was privileged to</b> have his <b>countenance [<i>kelaster</i>]</b> glow. <br>Because <b>he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him”</b> (Exodus 34:30). <br>Because he did not <b>“gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 12:8). |
| Exodus 3:8 | flowing with milk and honey” | Ketubot 111b:22 | § <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel happened</b> to come <b>to Benei Berak.</b> He <b>saw those goats that were grazing beneath a fig</b> tree, <b>and there was honey oozing from the figs and milk dripping from</b> the goats, <b>and</b> the two liquids <b>were mixing together. He said: This is</b> the meaning of the verse “A land <b>flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:8). |
| Exodus 3:8 | the verse states: “Flowing with milk and honey” | Ketubot 112a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, one can suggest the following comparison: <b>Just as this deer is swift and its meat is not fatty, so too, Eretz Yisrael is swift to ripen</b> its fruit <b>but its fruit is not fat</b> and juicy. The Gemara explains: For this reason <b>the verse states: “Flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:8), to say that its fruit is <b>fat</b> and juicier <b>than milk and sweeter than honey.</b> |
| Exodus 3:14 | ‘I will be that I will be,’ | Berakhot 9b:6 | The Gemara proceeds to discuss the promise of redemption from Egypt that God made to Moses at the burning bush. When Moses asked God what to say when Israel asks him God’s name, “and God said to Moses: <b>‘I will be that I will be,’</b> and He said: ‘Thus you will say unto the children of Israel: I will be has sent me to you’” (Exodus 3:14). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, told</b> Moses <b>to go and tell Israel: I was with you in this enslavement,</b> and in this redemption, <b>and I will be with you in the enslavement of the kingdoms</b> in the future. |
| Exodus 3:15 | once every seven years, as it is written: “This is My name forever [ le’olam ]” | Kiddushin 71a:10 | § The above statement, concerning a matter that the Sages transmitted privately and infrequently, leads the Gemara to teach a similar <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Sages transmit</b> the correct pronunciation of <b>the four-letter name</b> of God <b>to their students once every seven years, and some say twice every seven years. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: It stands to reason in accordance with the one who says</b> that they transmit it <b>once every seven years, as it is written: “This is My name forever [<i>le’olam</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which is <b>written</b> so that it can be read <b><i>le’alem</i>,</b> to hide. This indicates that the Divine Name must remain hidden. The Gemara relates: <b>Rava planned to expound</b> and explain the proper way to say the name <b>in</b> a public <b>discourse. A certain elder said to him: It is written</b> so that it can be read <b><i>le’alem</i>,</b> indicating that it must stay hidden. |
| Exodus 3:15 | and it is written: “This is My remembrance” | Kiddushin 71a:11 | <b>Rabbi Avina raised a contradiction: It is written: “This is My name,”</b> indicating that the name as written is that of God; <b>and it is written: “This is My remembrance”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which indicates that it is not God’s actual name but merely a way of remembering His name. The explanation is as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Not as I am written am I pronounced. I am written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>,</b> <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>while</b> My name is <b>pronounced with</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>,</b> <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>. |
| Exodus 3:15 | forever is written | Pesachim 50a:20 | <b>Rava thought to expound</b> upon the correct punctuation and enunciation of the name of God during his public <b>lecture</b> before one of the Festivals. <b>A certain old man said to him:</b> The word <b>forever is written</b> in the verse: “This is My name forever [<i>le’olam</i>]” (Exodus 3:15) without the letter <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>le’alem</i>, to conceal, meaning that the name should be concealed. |
| Exodus 3:15 | “And this is My memorial unto all generations” | Pesachim 50a:21 | <b>Rabbi Avina raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“This is My name forever,”</b> implying a requirement to conceal the name of God, and in the very next phrase it states: <b>“And this is My memorial unto all generations”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which indicates that the name of God is to be publicized and remembered by all. Rather, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I,</b> i.e., My name, is <b>not read as I am written. I am written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i></b> and <b><i>heh</i>, and I am read with</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i></b> and <b><i>dalet</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 3:16 | and, for example: “I have surely revisited [ pakadeti ] you” | Rosh Hashanah32b:5 | Verses that mention God’s <b>revisitings [<i>pikdonot</i>] are</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances [<i>zikhronot</i>],</b> and therefore they may be counted in the ten verses. <b>For example: “And the Lord revisited [<i>pakad</i>] Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and, for example: “I have surely revisited [<i>pakadeti</i>] you”</b> (Exodus 3:16). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: They are not</b> equivalent <b>to</b> verses of <b>remembrances.</b> |
| Exodus 3:16 | a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel” | Yoma 28b:7 | When <b>they were in Egypt</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when <b>they were in the desert,</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16). <b>Abraham our Patriarch</b> was himself <b>an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years”</b> (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <b>Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old</b> and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, <b>Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age”</b> (Genesis 48:10). |
| Exodus 3:17 | “A land flowing with milk and honey” | Bekhorot 6b:18 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that proof may be brought <b>from here:</b> The Torah praises Eretz Yisrael as: <b>“A land flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:17), <b>and if</b> milk <b>was not permitted, would the verse praise</b> the land <b>to us with an item that is not suitable</b> for consumption? <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a proof <b>from here: “Come, buy, and eat; and come, buy wine and milk without money and without price”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Exodus 4:1 | But they will not believe me | Shabbat 97a:4 | On the topic of Miriam’s leprosy, the Gemara cites that which <b>Reish Lakish said: One who suspects the innocent</b> of indiscretion <b>is afflicted in his body, as it is written:</b> “And Moses answered and said: <b>But they will not believe me</b> and will not hearken to my voice, for they will say, God did not appear to you” (Exodus 4:1), <b>and it is revealed before the Holy One, Blessed be He, that the Jewish people would believe.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>They are believers, the children of believers; and ultimately, you will not believe.</b> |
| Exodus 4:2 | Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [ ma ] is that in your hand” | Bava Batra110a:3 | In connection with the Gemara’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Gemara quotes additional statements of the Sages concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <b>“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who brought you here [<i>halom</i>], and what [<i>ma</i>] are you doing in this place, and what do you have here [<i>po</i>]?”</b> (Judges 18:3). The Sages interpret their multiple questions. <b>They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [<i>halom</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:5)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [<i>ma</i>] is that in your hand”</b> (Exodus 4:2)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [<i>po</i>] with me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27)? <b>Shall you,</b> a descendant of our teacher Moses, <b>become a priest for idol worship?</b> |
| Exodus 4:6 | is fit to be afflicted with leprosy. It is written here: “By the hand of Moses to him,” and it is written there: “And the Lord said furthermore to him: Put now your hand into your bosom. | Sanhedrin 110a:7 | <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> One who perpetuates a dispute <b>is fit to be afflicted with leprosy. It is written here: “By the hand of Moses to him,” and it is written there: “And the Lord said furthermore to him: Put now your hand into your bosom.</b> And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow” (Exodus 4:6). Based on the verbal analogy based on the term “to him” written in both verses, it is derived that the punishment for perpetuating a dispute is leprosy. |
| Exodus 4:6 | As it is written: “And God said to him further: Bring your hand to your bosom, | Shabbat 97a:5 | <b>They are believers, as it is written: “And the people believed</b> once they heard that God had remembered the children of Israel, and that He saw their affliction, and they bowed and they prostrated” (Exodus 4:31). <b>The children of believers,</b> as it says with regard to Abraham our Patriarch: <b>“And he believed in God,</b> and He counted it for him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). <b>Ultimately, you will not believe, as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Moses and to Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b> to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel” (Numbers 20:12). <b>From where</b> do we know that Moses <b>was afflicted</b> in his body? <b>As it is written: “And God said to him further: Bring your hand to your bosom,</b> and he brought his hand to his bosom and he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow” (Exodus 4:6). |
| Exodus 4:6 | attribute of punishment, it is written, “And he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow” | Shabbat 97a:6 | On this topic, <b>Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said: The divine <b>attribute of beneficence takes effect more quickly than the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment.</b> From where is this derived? <b>While, with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment, it is written, “And he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow”</b> (Exodus 4:6), <b>with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of beneficence it is written:</b> “And He said: Return your hand to your bosom, and he returned his hand to his bosom <b>and he took it out from his bosom and behold, it had returned to be like his original flesh”</b> (Exodus 4:7). The Gemara analyzes this as follows: It was already <b>from his bosom</b> that <b>it returned to be like his original flesh.</b> Moses’ hand was healed even before he took his hand out. |
| Exodus 4:7 | and he took it out from his bosom and behold, it had returned to be like his original flesh” | Shabbat 97a:6 | On this topic, <b>Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said: The divine <b>attribute of beneficence takes effect more quickly than the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment.</b> From where is this derived? <b>While, with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment, it is written, “And he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow”</b> (Exodus 4:6), <b>with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of beneficence it is written:</b> “And He said: Return your hand to your bosom, and he returned his hand to his bosom <b>and he took it out from his bosom and behold, it had returned to be like his original flesh”</b> (Exodus 4:7). The Gemara analyzes this as follows: It was already <b>from his bosom</b> that <b>it returned to be like his original flesh.</b> Moses’ hand was healed even before he took his hand out. |
| Exodus 4:14 | And Rabbi Mallai said: | Shabbat 139a:14 | <b>And Rabbi Mallai said:</b> It is stated in the verse: “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said: Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite, I know that he can surely speak, and also behold, he is coming out to greet you, and he will see you and be glad in his heart” (Exodus 4:14). Rabbi Mallai taught that <b>as reward for</b> Aaron’s lack of jealousy at seeing his brother Moses rise to greatness, as it is stated: <b>“And he will see you and be glad in his heart,” he merited</b> to become the High Priest, and <b>for the breastplate of judgment</b> to rest <b>on his heart.</b> |
| Exodus 4:14 | “And the anger of the Lord burned against Moses, | Zevachim 102a:6 | The Gemara comments: The question of whether Moses was a High Priest is <b>subject to</b> a dispute among <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: When Moses was at the burning bush and expressed hesitation to deliver God’s message to Pharaoh, the verse states: <b>“And the anger of the Lord burned against Moses,</b> and He said: Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart” (Exodus 4:14). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> For <b>every burning anger that</b> is stated <b>in the Torah, its effect is</b> also <b>stated,</b> i.e., the Torah records an action or pronouncement as a consequence of that anger, <b>but</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>no effect of</b> the anger <b>is stated.</b> |
| Exodus 4:18 | Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace” | Berakhot 64a:9 | <b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who takes leave from another should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather,</b> he should say: <b>Go to peace. As we see</b> that, on the one hand, <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>Moses ascended and was successful.</b> On the other hand, <b>David said to</b> his son, <b>Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and Absalom <b>went and was</b> ultimately <b>hanged.</b> |
| Exodus 4:18 | Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace” | Moed Katan29a:4 | <b>One who departs from the living should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather: Go to peace, as David said to Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and <b>he</b> subsequently <b>went and was hanged;</b> whereas <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>he went and was successful.</b> |
| Exodus 4:19 | are dead” | Avodah Zarah5a:18 | <b>A pauper</b> is considered as though dead, <b>as it is written</b> that God said to Moses: “Go, return to Egypt; <b>for all the men</b> that sought your life <b>are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). <b>And who were these</b> men? They were <b>Dathan and Abiram. But did they</b> really <b>die? They were</b> still alive, as they participated in the rebellion of Korah, which took place years later. <b>Rather,</b> the verse does not mean that they had died, but <b>that they had lost their property</b> and become impoverished. This demonstrates that a pauper is considered as though he were dead. |
| Exodus 4:19 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to me: “Go, return into Egypt” | Nedarim 31b:14 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Heaven forbid that Moses our teacher was neglectful of the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision. Rather, this</b> is what <b>he said:</b> If <b>I circumcise</b> the child now <b>and depart</b> to begin my journey, it <b>is a danger</b> for the child, <b>as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25), which indicates that the pain of circumcision lasts for several days and the child may be in danger while in pain. If <b>I circumcise</b> him immediately <b>and wait three days</b> and only then embark on the journey, this is problematic, as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to me: “Go, return into Egypt”</b> (Exodus 4:19), i.e., go immediately. For these reasons Moses did not circumcise the child immediately, but no neglect existed on his part. <b>But</b> according to this explanation, <b>for what reason was Moses punished?</b> |
| Exodus 4:19 | “For all the men are dead | Nedarim 64b:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer further said:</b> They <b>may broach</b> dissolution <b>by</b> asking about <b>a new situation,</b> but the Rabbis prohibit it. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? Rav Ḥisda said: For the verse states</b> that God told Moses he could return to Egypt from Midian, despite having vowed to Yitro that he would not do so: <b>“For all the men are dead</b> that sought your life” (Exodus 4:19), and he took the vow only because it would be dangerous for him to return to Egypt. The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But death is a new circumstance,</b> and Moses’ vow was dissolved based on the men dying. Therefore, it can be understood <b>from here that</b> they <b>may broach</b> dissolution <b>by</b> asking about <b>a new situation.</b> |
| Exodus 4:19 | and one who has no children. A pauper, as it is written: “For all the men are dead” | Nedarim 64b:6 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Any person who does not have children is considered like a dead</b> person. The source is <b>as is stated</b> in the words Rachel said to Jacob: <b>“Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four are considered as</b> if they were <b>dead: A pauper, and a leper, and a blind</b> person, <b>and one who has no children. A pauper, as it is written: “For all the men are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). As explained above, they were not actually dead but had descended into poverty, and yet they were considered dead. <b>A leper, as it is written</b> that Aaron said to Moses with regard to Miriam’s leprosy: <b>“Let her not, I pray, be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12). <b>And a blind</b> person, <b>as it is written: “He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead”</b> (Lamentations 3:6). <b>And one who has no children, as it is written: “Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1). |
| Exodus 4:19 | Rav Naḥman said: As it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead” | Nedarim 65a:1 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:12): With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another, they dissolve</b> the vow <b>for him only in the presence</b> of the one who is the subject of the vow. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman said: As it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). Rav Naḥman notes that the verse specifies where God spoke to Moses, and explains that God <b>said to him: In Midian you vowed</b> to Yitro that you would not return to Egypt, <b>go and dissolve your vow in Midian.</b> And where does it say that Moses vowed to Yitro? <b>For it is written: “And Moses was content [<i>vayo’el</i>]</b> to dwell with the man” (Exodus 2:21). The word <i>vayo’el</i> is related to the word <i>ala</i>, and <b><i>ala</i> means nothing other than an oath, as it is written: “And he…brought him under an oath [<i>ala</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13), and the <i>halakhot</i> of dissolution of oaths are identical to those of dissolution of vows. |
| Exodus 4:19 | like death, as it is stated: “For all the men are dead | Nedarim 7b:5 | <b>And poverty is</b> so harsh that it is considered <b>like death, as it is stated: “For all the men are dead</b> who sought your life” (Exodus 4:19). The Sages had a tradition that Dathan and Abiram had sought to have Moses killed in Egypt and that they were the men referred to in the quoted verse (see 64b). They were still alive at that time but had become impoverished. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wherever</b> it says that <b>the Sages set their eyes</b> on a particular individual, the result was <b>either death or poverty.</b> This also indicates that death and poverty are equivalent. |
| Exodus 4:20 | For in their anger they slew an ox and in their self-will they uprooted a trough, | Megillah 9a:15 | They also altered the verse: “For in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they slaughtered an ox” (Genesis 49:6), to read: <b>For in their anger they slew an ox and in their self-will they uprooted a trough,</b> to avoid the charge that Jacob’s sons were murderers. Instead of: “And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey” (Exodus 4:20), they wrote: <b>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a carrier of people,</b> which could be understood as referring to a horse or a camel rather than the lowly donkey. |
| Exodus 4:20 | But isn’t it written: “And Moses took his wife and his children and rode them upon his donkey” | Pesachim 3a:14 | With regard to the above <i>baraita</i> taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael, the Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a woman, is</b> the term <b>riding not written</b> in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Rebecca and her damsels arose and they rode upon camels”</b> (Genesis 24:61)? The Gemara answers: <b>There, due to fear of camels, that is standard conduct.</b> Since a camel’s back is high off the ground, a woman cannot sit on it sidesaddle; consequently, she may ride on it without being considered immodest. The Gemara cites another relevant verse. <b>But isn’t it written: “And Moses took his wife and his children and rode them upon his donkey”</b> (Exodus 4:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> despite the fact that his wife was also on the donkey, the verse employs the language of riding |
| Exodus 4:22 | say before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a father who can testify about his son? As it is written: “Israel is My son, My firstborn” | Avodah Zarah3a:5 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them</b> in response: <b>I</b> will <b>testify about</b> the Jewish people <b>that they fulfilled the Torah</b> in <b>its entirety.</b> The nations <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a father who can testify about his son? As it is written: “Israel is My son, My firstborn”</b> (Exodus 4:22). Since God is considered the Father of the Jewish people, He is disqualified from testifying on their behalf. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Heaven and earth will testify about them that they fulfilled the Torah</b> in <b>its entirety.</b> |
| Exodus 4:22 | isn’t it written: “My firstborn son [ beni ] is Israel” | Sanhedrin 43a:25 | Then <b>they brought Buni in</b> to stand trial. Buni <b>said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Buni be executed?</b> But <b>isn’t it written: “My firstborn son [<i>beni</i>] is Israel”</b> (Exodus 4:22)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Buni shall be executed, as it is written: “Behold, I shall kill your firstborn son [<i>binkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 4:23). |
| Exodus 4:22 | said to him: Even with regard to David, king of Israel. The convert reasoned an a fortiori inference himself: If the Jewish people are called God’s children, and due to the love that God loved them he called them: “Israel is My son, My firstborn” | Shabbat 31a:8 | Hillel <b>said to him,</b> to the convert: <b>Is it not</b> the way of the world that <b>only one who knows the protocols [<i>takhsisei</i>]</b> of royalty <b>is appointed king? Go</b> and <b>learn the royal protocols</b> by engaging in Torah study. <b>He went and read</b> the Bible. <b>When he reached</b> the verse which says: <b>“And the common man that draws near shall be put to death”</b> (Numbers 1:51), the convert <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>With regard to whom is the verse speaking?</b> Hillel <b>said to him: Even with regard to David, king of Israel. The convert reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i> inference himself: If the Jewish people are called God’s children, and due to the love that God loved them he called them: “Israel is My son, My firstborn”</b> (Exodus 4:22), and nevertheless <b>it is written about them: And the common man that draws near shall be put to death; a mere convert who came</b> without merit, <b>with</b> nothing more than <b>his staff and traveling bag, all the more so</b> that this applies to him, as well. |
| Exodus 4:22 | call them, “My son, My firstborn son | Shabbat 89b:4 | Apropos the Jewish people assessing their forefathers, the Gemara cites a related teaching. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For You are our Father; for Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us; You, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer, everlasting is Your name”</b> (Isaiah 63:16)? <b>In the future</b> that will surely <b>come, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will say to Abraham: Your children have sinned against Me.</b> Abraham will <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> if so, <b>let them be eradicated to sanctify Your name.</b> God <b>said: I will say it to Jacob.</b> Since he experienced <b>the pain of raising children,</b> perhaps <b>he will ask for mercy on their behalf.</b> He <b>said to</b> Jacob: <b>Your children have sinned.</b> Jacob <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> if so, <b>let them be eradicated to sanctify Your name.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said: There is no reason in elders and no wisdom in youth.</b> Neither Abraham nor Jacob knew how to respond properly. He <b>said to Isaac: Your children have sinned against Me.</b> Isaac <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> are they <b>my children and not Your children? At</b> Sinai, <b>when they accorded precedence to “We will do” over “We will listen” before You,</b> didn’t You <b>call them, “My son, My firstborn son</b> Israel” (Exodus 4:22)? <b>Now</b> that they have sinned, are they <b>my children and not Your children?</b> |
| Exodus 4:23 | They said to him: Yes, Buni shall be executed, as it is written: “Behold, I shall kill your firstborn son [ binkha ]” | Sanhedrin 43a:25 | Then <b>they brought Buni in</b> to stand trial.

| Exodus 4:24 | circumcision, as it is stated: “And the Lord met him and sought to kill him” | Nedarim 31b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that all the merits that Moses our teacher</b> accrued when he <b>performed</b> mitzvot <b>did not protect him when he was negligent about</b> performing <b>the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision, as it is stated: “And the Lord met him and sought to kill him”</b> (Exodus 4:24). |
| Exodus 4:24 | as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place” | Nedarim 32a:1 | <b>Because he was occupied with lodging first</b> and did not immediately perform the mitzva of circumcision, <b>as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place”</b> (Exodus 4:24). |
| Exodus 4:25 | But isn’t it written: “Then Zipporah took [ vattikkaḥ ] a flint | Avodah Zarah27a:14 | The Gemara raises a difficulty against this explanation: <b>And is there anyone who says</b> that <b>a woman may not</b> perform circumcision? <b>But isn’t it written: “Then Zipporah took [<i>vattikkaḥ</i>] a flint</b> and cut off the foreskin of her son” (Exodus 4:25). This verse explicitly states that a circumcision was performed by a woman. The Gemara answers that one should <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>And she caused to be taken [<i>vattakkaḥ</i>],</b> i.e., she did not take a flint herself. <b>But isn’t it written: And she cut off [<i>vattikhrot</i>]? Read into</b> the verse: <b>And she caused to be cut off [<i>vattakhret</i>], as she told another person</b> to take a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, <b>and he did</b> so. The Gemara provides an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>She came and began</b> the act, <b>and Moses came and completed</b> the circumcision. |
| Exodus 4:25 | as it is stated: “Surely a bridegroom of blood are you to me” | Nedarim 32a:2 | <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: It was not Moses our teacher</b> that <b>Satan wanted to kill, but rather, that infant</b> who was not circumcised, <b>as it is stated: “Surely a bridegroom of blood are you to me”</b> (Exodus 4:25). <b>Go out and see: Who</b> does it make sense would be the one that <b>is called the bridegroom</b> in this instance? <b>You must say this is the infant,</b> since he is the one who entered the covenant of Abraham by means of the circumcision. |
| Exodus 4:25 | Immediately, “Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son” | Nedarim 32a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Bizna taught: At the time that Moses our teacher was negligent about the circumcision,</b> the destructive angels named <b>Af,</b> meaning anger, <b>and Ḥeima,</b> meaning wrath, <b>came and swallowed him, and only his legs were left</b> outside. <b>Immediately, “Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son”</b> (Exodus 4:25), and <b>immediately “He let him alone”</b> (Exodus 4:26). |
| Exodus 4:26 | immediately “He let him alone” | Nedarim 32a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Bizna taught: At the time that Moses our teacher was negligent about the circumcision,</b> the destructive angels named <b>Af,</b> meaning anger, <b>and Ḥeima,</b> meaning wrath, <b>came and swallowed him, and only his legs were left</b> outside. <b>Immediately, “Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son”</b> (Exodus 4:25), and <b>immediately “He let him alone”</b> (Exodus 4:26). |
| Exodus 4:31 | They are believers, as it is written: “And the people believed | Shabbat 97a:5 | <b>They are believers, as it is written: “And the people believed</b> once they heard that God had remembered the children of Israel, and that He saw their affliction, and they bowed and they prostrated” (Exodus 4:31). <b>The children of believers,</b> as it says with regard to Abraham our Patriarch: <b>“And he believed in God,</b> and He counted it for him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). <b>Ultimately, you will not believe, as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Moses and to Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b> to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel” (Numbers 20:12). <b>From where</b> do we know that Moses <b>was afflicted</b> in his body? <b>As it is written: “And God said to him further: Bring your hand to your bosom,</b> and he brought his hand to his bosom and he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow” (Exodus 4:6). |
| Exodus 5:1 | that they may hold a feast [ veyaḥogu ] to Me in the wilderness” | Chagigah 10b:3 | Abaye responded: <b>However, if that is so,</b> consider <b>that it is written:</b> “Let My people go, <b>that they may hold a feast [<i>veyaḥogu</i>] to Me in the wilderness”</b> (Exodus 5:1). <b>So too,</b> the meaning of this verse <b>is that</b> they will merely <b>celebrate a Festival,</b> and not bring an offering. <b>And if you would say that is</b> indeed <b>so,</b> that this means that they should celebrate a Festival, <b>but isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-</b>offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God” (Exodus 10:25)? This shows that the command is referring to offerings. |
| Exodus 5:1 | It is written here: “They shall make an offering to Me in the wilderness” | Chagigah 10b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this explanation in favor of the claim that the source for a Festival peace-offering <b>comes</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“wilderness”</b> stated here and the term: <b>“wilderness”</b> stated elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “They shall make an offering to Me in the wilderness”</b> (Exodus 5:1), <b>and it is written there: “Did you bring to Me sacrifices and offerings</b> forty years <b>in the wilderness,</b> house of Israel?” (Amos 5:25). <b>Just as there</b> it is referring to actual <b>animal offerings, so too here,</b> it is referring to <b>animal offerings,</b> not merely the celebration of a Festival. |
| Exodus 5:2 | he said: “Who is the Lord” | Chullin 89a:7 | <b>But the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are not so.

I granted greatness <b>to Pharaoh,</b> yet <b>he said: “Who is the Lord”</b> (Exodus 5:2). I granted greatness <b>to Sennacherib,</b> yet he said: <b>“Who are they among all the gods of the countries</b> that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand” (II Kings 18:35). I granted greatness <b>to Nebuchadnezzar,</b> yet <b>he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</b> (Isaiah 14:14).

| Exodus 5:2 | “Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice?” | Sanhedrin 94b:2 | <b>Pharaoh</b> blasphemed God, <b>as it is written</b> that he said to Moses and Aaron: <b>“Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice?”</b> (Exodus 5:2) <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself exacted retribution from him, as it is written: “And the Lord overthrew Egypt in the midst of the sea”</b> (Exodus 14:27), <b>and it is written: “You have trodden through the sea with Your horses”</b> (Habakkuk 3:15). <b>Sennacherib</b> blasphemed God by means of an agent, <b>as it is written: “By your messengers you have taunted the Lord”</b> (II Kings 19:23). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, exacted retribution from him by means of an agent, as it is written: “Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand”</b> (II Kings 19:35). |
| Exodus 5:20 | or standing | Nedarim 64b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is their reason</b> for not accepting this proof? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold: These</b> people who were seeking Moses’ life, <b>had they</b> indeed <b>died? But Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Wherever it is stated</b> in the Torah the term <b>striving</b> (Exodus 2:13), in reference to the men who slandered Moses, <b>or standing</b> (Exodus 5:20), in reference to those who complained against Moses and Aaron, <b>they are none other than Dathan and Abiram.</b> Dathan and Abiram were alive during the rebellion of Korah, which occurred years later, so they could not have been dead when God instructed Moses to return to Egypt. <b>Rather, Reish Lakish said:</b> They did not literally die, but the verse means <b>that they lost their property</b> and their status in the community, which meant their opinions were no longer granted credibility, and consequently, Moses could safely return to Egypt. Such a turn of events is not considered to be a new circumstance. |
| Exodus 5:22 | “Why have You dealt ill with this people? | Sanhedrin 44a:15 | <b>Rather,</b> Joshua’s belligerence is seen <b>from this</b> verse: <b>“Why have You brought this people over the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 7:7), as if he were complaining about God’s treatment of Israel. This too is difficult, as <b>Moses also said</b> a similar statement: <b>“Why have You dealt ill with this people?</b> Why is it that You have sent me?” (Exodus 5:22). <b>Rather,</b> Joshua’s belligerence is seen <b>from here,</b> from the continuation of the previously cited verse in Joshua: <b>“Would that we had been content and had remained in the Transjordan”</b> (Joshua 7:7). |
| Exodus 5:23 | And now you say to Me: “Neither have You delivered Your people” | Sanhedrin 111a:10 | <b>I said to Jacob: “The land upon which you lie, to you I will give it”</b> (Genesis 28:13). <b>He sought a place to pitch his tent and he did not find</b> one <b>until he purchased</b> it <b>for one hundred coins, and he did not question My attributes, and did not say to Me: What is Your name? And you,</b> Moses, <b>ask Me: What is Your name, initially,</b> after witnessing My greatness more than they ever did. <b>And now you say to Me: “Neither have You delivered Your people”</b> (Exodus 5:23). The verse then states: <b>“Now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh”</b> (Exodus 6:1). One can infer: <b>The war with Pharaoh</b> and his downfall <b>you</b> shall <b>see, but you will not see the war with the thirty-one kings</b> in Eretz Yisrael, as you will not be privileged to conquer Eretz Yisrael for the Jewish people. |
| Exodus 5:23 | Moses, our teacher, was punished, as it is stated: “For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people, | Sanhedrin 111a:7 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: One time I entered Alexandria of Egypt. I found one old man and he said to me: Come and I will show you what my ancestors,</b> the Egyptians, <b>did to your ancestors,</b> the Jewish people. Some <b>of them they drowned in the sea,</b> some <b>of them they killed with the sword,</b> and <b>some of them they crushed in the buildings.

| Exodus 6:1 | “Now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh” | Sanhedrin 111a:10 | <b>I said to Jacob: “The land upon which you lie, to you I will give it”</b> (Genesis 28:13). <b>He sought a place to pitch his tent and he did not find</b> one <b>until he purchased</b> it <b>for one hundred coins, and he did not question My attributes, and did not say to Me: What is Your name?

| Exodus 6:4 | “I have also established My covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan” | Sanhedrin 90b:7 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: From where</b> is <b>resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Patriarchs: <b>“I have also established My covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan”</b> (Exodus 6:4). The phrase: To give <b>to you</b> the land of Canaan, <b>is not stated,</b> as the meaning of the verse is not that God fulfilled the covenant with the Patriarchs when he gave the land of Canaan to the children of Israel; <b>rather,</b> it is stated: “To give <b>to them</b> the land of Canaan,” meaning to the Patriarchs themselves. <b>From here</b> is it derived that <b>the resurrection of the dead is from the Torah,</b> as in the future the Patriarchs will come to life and inherit the land. |
| Exodus 6:6 | It is written here: “And I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt” | Rosh Hashanah11b:2 | It was also taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased.</b> From where is this known? <b>It is written here: “And I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:6); <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7). From here it is derived by verbal analogy between the two instances of the word “burden” that just as Joseph was released from prison in Tishrei, so too, the slavery of our forefathers in Egypt ended in Tishrei. |
| Exodus 6:7 | who is bringing you forth [ hamotzi ] from under the burdens of Egypt” | Berakhot 38a:14 | We learned in the mishna <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past. |
| Exodus 6:7 | it is stated: “And I will take you to Me as a people” | Sanhedrin 111a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the few that are destined to be redeemed: <b>Rav Simai says</b> that <b>it is stated: “And I will take you to Me as a people”</b> (Exodus 6:7), <b>and</b> juxtaposed to that verse <b>it is stated: “And I will bring you</b> into the land” (Exodus 6:8). The Torah <b>compares their exodus from Egypt to their entry into the land; just as</b> during <b>their entry into the land</b> only <b>two of six hundred thousand</b> entered the land, as they all died in the wilderness except for Caleb and Joshua, <b>so too,</b> during <b>their exodus from Egypt,</b> in terms of the ratio, <b>only two of six hundred thousand</b> left Egypt and the rest died there. <b>Rava says: And likewise,</b> that will be the situation <b>in the messianic era, as it is stated: “And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt”</b> (Hosea 2:17). The ultimate redemption and the exodus from Egypt are juxtaposed, indicating that in the messianic era too, only few will survive. |
| Exodus 6:8 | and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord” | Bava Batra117b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> verse, which states: <b>“According to the names of the tribes of their fathers</b> they shall inherit” (Numbers 26:55), <b>is written with regard to those who left Egypt; perhaps</b> the verse <b>was stated</b> in reference <b>to</b> the progenitors of the <b>tribes,</b> and teaches that the land should be divided among the twelve tribes? The Gemara answers: The inference is from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And I will bring you in to the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; <b>and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). This verse states that Eretz Yisrael <b>is an inheritance for you from your forefathers, and</b> this verse <b>was told to those who left Egypt,</b> indicating that those who left Egypt inherit the land. |
| Exodus 6:8 | as it is written: “And I will give it to you for a heritage [ morasha ]: I am the Lord” | Bava Batra119b:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is what Moses <b>was uncertain</b> about, <b>as it is written: “And I will give it to you for a heritage [<i>morasha</i>]: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). Moses was unsure if the verse should be understood: <b>It</b> is <b>an inheritance [<i>yerusha</i>] for you from your fathers,</b> such that it is considered in the possession of those who left Egypt; <b>or perhaps</b> the verse indicates another matter, <b>that</b> the generation of those who left Egypt <b>bequeath [<i>morishin</i>]</b> the portions to others <b>but they do not inherit [<i>yoreshin</i>]</b> the portions themselves, because they are destined to die in the wilderness. |
| Exodus 6:8 | it is stated: “And I will bring you | Sanhedrin 111a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the few that are destined to be redeemed: <b>Rav Simai says</b> that <b>it is stated: “And I will take you to Me as a people”</b> (Exodus 6:7), <b>and</b> juxtaposed to that verse <b>it is stated: “And I will bring you</b> into the land” (Exodus 6:8).

| Exodus 6:20 | “And the years of the life of Amram were seven and thirty and a hundred years” | Megillah 11a:22 | The opening verse continues, stating that Ahasuerus reigned “over <b>seven and twenty and a hundred provinces”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This verse should be understood as follows: <b>At first he reigned over seven</b> provinces; <b>and then he reigned over twenty</b> more; <b>and finally he reigned over</b> another <b>hundred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> with regard to the similarly worded verse: <b>“And the years of the life of Amram were seven and thirty and a hundred years”</b> (Exodus 6:20), <b>what would you expound</b> from <b>it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the book of Esther, <b>as</b> this part of <b>the verse is</b> entirely <b>superfluous. Since it is</b> already <b>written: “From Hodu to Cush,” why</b> then <b>do I need “Seven and twenty and a hundred provinces”?</b> Rather, <b>learn from here</b> that these words come <b>for</b> this <b>exposition,</b> to teach that Ahasuerus did not begin to reign over all of them at the same time. |
| Exodus 6:20 | “And Amram took Jochebed his aunt | Sanhedrin 58b:3 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Akiva from the verse: <b>“And Amram took Jochebed his aunt</b> as a wife” (Exodus 6:20). <b>What,</b> was she <b>not his maternal aunt?</b> Presumably, Jochebed was the sister of Kohath, Amram’s father, from both of Kohath’s parents, and not from his father alone. Evidently, a descendant of Noah may marry his father’s sister. |
| Exodus 6:23 | as it is stated: “And Aaron took Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Nahshon” | Bava Batra110a:2 | <b>Rava says: One who marries a woman needs to</b> first <b>examine her brothers</b> so that he will know in advance what character his children will have, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron took Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Nahshon”</b> (Exodus 6:23). <b>By inference from that which is stated: “The daughter of Amminadav,” do I not know that she is the sister of Nahshon,</b> as Nahshon was the son of Amminadav? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The sister of Nahshon”? From here</b> one learns <b>that one who marries a woman needs to examine her brothers.</b> The reason is as the Sages <b>taught: Most sons resemble the mother’s brothers.</b> |
| Exodus 6:25 | come from Yitro? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as a wife; | Bava Batra109b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did Pinehas not</b> also <b>come from Yitro? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as a wife;</b> and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <b>What, is it not</b> stating <b>that</b> Pinehas <b>came from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, who</b> was also called Putiel because he <b>fattened [<i>pittem</i>] calves for idol worship?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is stating <b>that he came from Joseph, who battled [<i>shepitpet</i>] with his desire</b> by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife. |
| Exodus 6:25 | one of the daughters of Putiel” | Bava Batra110a:1 | <b>Rather,</b> this is how the matter should be resolved: <b>If his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro,</b> and <b>if his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph,</b> so while his mother was descended from Joseph on one side and from Yitro on the other, Pinehas was a more distant relative to Yitro than Jonathan was. Based on this conclusion, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written:</b> “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took <b>one of the daughters of Putiel”</b> (Exodus 6:25). <b>Conclude from</b> the wording of the verse that Pinehas was descended from <b>two</b> men who were referred to as Puti: Yitro and Joseph. |
| Exodus 6:25 | Joseph? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took himself a wife from the daughters of Putiel; | Sotah 43a:2 | A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> It was <b>not for nothing</b> that specifically <b>Pinehas went to war</b> with Midian; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>to exact</b> the rightful <b>judgment of his mother’s father,</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the Midianites sold him into Egypt</b> to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s” (Genesis 37:36). The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Pinehas came,</b> on his mother’s side, <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took himself a wife from the daughters of Putiel;</b> and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <b>What, is it not that</b> Pinehas <b>came from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, who</b> was also called Putiel because he <b>fattened [<i>pittem</i>] calves for idol worship?</b> They answer: <b>No;</b> he was descended <b>from Joseph, who mocked [<i>pitpet</i>] his desire</b> by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife. |
| Exodus 6:26 | “This is [ hu ] Aaron and Moses” | Megillah 11a:18 | The Gemara continues: The word <i>hu</i> is also used to recognize sustained righteousness. <b>“Abram, this is [<i>hu</i>] Abraham”</b> (I Chronicles 1:27); this indicates that Abraham didn’t change, as <b>he</b> remained <b>in his righteousness from beginning to end.</b> Similarly, <b>“This is [<i>hu</i>] Aaron and Moses”</b> (Exodus 6:26); <b>they remained in their righteousness from</b> the <b>beginning</b> of their life <b>to</b> the <b>end</b> of their life. Similarly, with respect to David: <b>“And David, this was [<i>hu</i>] the youngest”</b> (I Samuel 17:14), indicates that <b>he remained in his humility from beginning to end. Just as in his youth,</b> when he was still an ordinary individual, <b>he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in Torah, so too, in his kingship, he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in wisdom.</b> |
| Exodus 7:4 | as it is stated: “And I shall bring forth My hosts [ tzivotai ], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt” | Shevuot 35b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <b><i>tzevaot</i> may be erased</b> in <b>its entirety, as</b> God <b>is called <i>Tzevaot</i> only in the context of</b> the children of <b>Israel,</b> and it is not an independent name of God, <b>as it is stated: “And I shall bring forth My hosts [<i>tzivotai</i>], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 7:4). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> |
| Exodus 7:11 | “ belahateihem ” | Sanhedrin 67b:10 | <b>Rabbi Aivu bar Nagri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that in the verse: “And the magicians of Egypt did in that manner <b>with their secret arts [<i>belateihem</i>]”</b> (Exodus 7:22), <b>these</b> words <b>are</b> describing <b>acts of</b> employing <b>demons,</b> which are invisible, and their actions are therefore hidden [<i>balat</i>]. With regard to the similar term <b>“<i>belahateihem</i>”</b> (Exodus 7:11), <b>these are acts of sorcery,</b> which sorcerers perform themselves, without using demons. <b>And likewise it says: “And the flaming [<i>lahat</i>] sword that turned every way”</b> (Genesis 3:24), referring to a sword that revolves by itself. |
| Exodus 7:12 | and Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs” | Shabbat 97a:7 | The Gemara proceeds to discuss another miracle that transpired at that time. With regard to the verse, “And each man threw down his staff and they became serpents, <b>and Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs”</b> (Exodus 7:12), <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This was <b>a miracle within a miracle.</b> It was Aaron’s staff, not his serpent, that swallowed the other staffs. |
| Exodus 7:15 | as it is stated: “Behold, he goes out to the water” | Moed Katan18a:13 | <b>Avitul the scribe</b> also <b>said in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> The <b>Pharaoh who lived in the days of Moses was a sorcerer</b> [<b><i>amgushi</i></b>], <b>as it is stated: “Behold, he goes out to the water”</b> (Exodus 7:15). Pharaoh would regularly go out to the water in order to engage in witchcraft. |
| Exodus 7:15 | and you shall stand by the river’s brink to meet him, | Zevachim 102a:11 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And does Reish Lakish</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it written:</b> “Go unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goes out unto the water; <b>and you shall stand by the river’s brink to meet him,</b> and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand” (Exodus 7:15); <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> God meant: Pharaoh <b>is a king, and</b> so you should <b>be amiable toward him, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> God meant: Pharaoh <b>is wicked, and</b> so you should <b>be insolent toward him.</b> If according to Reish Lakish Moses was commanded to greet Pharaoh with respect, how could he say that Moses slapped Pharaoh? The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the names of the Sages in this dispute; it is Reish Lakish who says that Moses was commanded to be insolent. |
| Exodus 7:21 | “And the fish [ daga ] that were in the river died” | Nedarim 51b:7 | The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>perhaps a large fish spat him out and a small fish</b> then <b>swallowed him. Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is difficult according to the following verse: <b>“And the fish [<i>daga</i>] that were in the river died”</b> (Exodus 7:21). Is it possible that the <b>small</b> fish <b>died</b> but the <b>large ones did not die?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the biblical word <b><i>daga</i></b> evidently <b>indicates large</b> fish <b>and</b> also <b>indicates small</b> fish. <b>However, with regard to vows</b> one should <b>follow the language of people,</b> and the word <i>daga</i> is used only in reference to small fish. |
| Exodus 7:22 | with their secret arts [ belateihem ]” | Sanhedrin 67b:10 | <b>Rabbi Aivu bar Nagri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that in the verse: “And the magicians of Egypt did in that manner <b>with their secret arts [<i>belateihem</i>]”</b> (Exodus 7:22), <b>these</b> words <b>are</b> describing <b>acts of</b> employing <b>demons,</b> which are invisible, and their actions are therefore hidden [<i>balat</i>].

With regard to <b>frogs, which are not commanded concerning the sanctification of the name</b> of God, <b>it is written:</b> “And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up <b>and come into your house,</b> and into your bedchamber, and onto your bed, and into the houses of your servants, and upon your people, <b>and into their ovens and kneading bowls”</b> (Exodus 7:28). <b>When are kneading bowls found near the oven? You must say that</b> it is <b>when the oven is hot.</b> If in fulfilling the command to harass the Egyptians, the frogs entered burning ovens, <b>all the more so, we, who are commanded concerning the sanctification of the name</b> of God, should deliver ourselves to be killed in the fiery furnace for that purpose. Apparently, Theodosius taught Torah in public, which indicates that he was a great man. |
| Exodus 7:29 | both upon you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants” | Sotah 11a:7 | The next verse states: <b>“And he said to his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel</b> are too many and too mighty for us” (Exodus 1:9). It was <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:11): <b>He,</b> Pharaoh, <b>initiated the proposal. Therefore,</b> of his people, <b>he was stricken first. He initiated the proposal, as it is written: “And he said to his people.” Therefore, he was stricken first, as it is written:</b> “And the frogs shall come up <b>both upon you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants”</b> (Exodus 7:29). |
| Exodus 8:2 | “And the frog came up and covered the land of Egypt” | Sanhedrin 67b:20 | It is stated with regard to the plagues of Egypt: <b>“And the frog came up and covered the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 8:2). Noting that the term “the frog” is written in the singular, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> At first <b>it was one frog; it spawned and filled the entire land of Egypt</b> with frogs. |
| Exodus 8:15 | “And the magicians said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God” | Sanhedrin 67b:15 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And the magicians said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God”</b> (Exodus 8:15), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is derived <b>from here that a demon cannot create an entity smaller than</b> the size of <b>a barley grain.</b> Consequently, the magicians were not capable of duplicating the plague of lice, and they realized that this was not an act of sorcery but was performed by God. |
| Exodus 8:15 | finger, as it is stated: “And the sorcerers said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God” | Sanhedrin 95b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> did the angel <b>strike them? Rabbi Eliezer says: He struck them by hand, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great hand”</b> (Exodus 14:31), where the term for hand, <i>yad</i>, is preceded by the definite article <i>ha</i>, indicating that this was <b>the hand that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He struck them with</b> His <b>finger, as it is stated: “And the sorcerers said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God”</b> (Exodus 8:15), <b>indicating</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>finger that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Gabriel:</b> Is <b>your scythe honed?</b> Gabriel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, it is standing honed from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “For they have fled from the swords,</b> from the honed sword” (Isaiah 21:15). |
| Exodus 9:10 | moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast” | Bava Kamma80b:12 | The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring <b>to moist</b> sores; whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to dry</b> sores, which are more dangerous than moist ones. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b>boils that the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians</b> were <b>moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast”</b> (Exodus 9:10). The phrase “breaking out” is referring to the exterior of the wound. Since the verse specifies that the outside was oozing with secretions, it can be inferred that the inside was dry. This indicates that the sores can be of either type. |
| Exodus 9:10 | “And it became a boil breaking forth with avabu’ot upon man | Bekhorot 41a:10 | <b>Rather, there are three</b> types of <i>garav</i>: First, the <i>garav</i> <b>of the verse</b> that deals with blemishes, which is <b>dry both on the inside and on the outside.</b> This cannot be healed, and it is called <i>ḥares</i> in Deuteronomy. The second is the <i>garav</i> <b>of the mishna,</b> which can be healed, and is <b>moist on the outside and inside.</b> Third, the <i>garav</i> <b>of Egypt,</b> mentioned in Deuteronomy as one of the types of boils of Egypt. This <i>garav</i> is <b>dry on the inside</b> and therefore cannot be healed, <b>but</b> it <b>is moist on the outside, as it is written</b> with regard to the plague of boils in Egypt: <b>“And it became a boil breaking forth with <i>avabu’ot</i> upon man</b> and upon animal” (Exodus 9:10). <i>Avabu’ot</i> is referring to a substance that pours out [<i>nove’a</i>] and is moist. |
| Exodus 9:31 | Egypt: | Menachot 68b:20 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that it <b>is stated “in the ear” with regard to</b> the plague of hail in <b>Egypt:</b> “And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom” (Exodus 9:31), <b>and it is stated “in the ear”</b> with regard to the mitzva of the new crop, which is <b>for</b> all <b>generations. Just as</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated with regard to</b> plague of hail in <b>Egypt</b> is referring to <b>barley,</b> as is clear from the next verse: “But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, for they ripen late” (Exodus 9:32), <b>so too</b> the term <b>“in the ear” that is stated</b> with regard to the new crop <b>for</b> all <b>generations</b> is referring to <b>barley.</b> |
| Exodus 9:31 | Egypt: | Menachot 84a:11 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that it <b>is stated “in the ear,” with regard to</b> the plague of hail in <b>Egypt:</b> “And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom” (Exodus 9:31), <b>and it is stated “in the ear”</b> with regard to the mitzva of the new crop, which is <b>for</b> all <b>generations.

| Exodus 9:33 | the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth” | Berakhot 54b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33). Moses’ hailstones remained suspended. And the stones <b>descended because of a man; that is Joshua,</b> who was also called man, <b>as it is written: “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit”</b> (Numbers 27:18). <b>And it is written</b> that when Joshua and his people waged war against the army of the Emorite kings, God told him not to fear them because God would deliver them into his hands; and indeed, they died by means of these stones: <b>“As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beit Ḥoron, that the Lord cast down great stones</b> from heaven upon them unto Azeka, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew by sword” (Joshua 10:11). |
| Exodus 10:25 | “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand offerings and burnt-offerings | Avodah Zarah24a:19 | § The Gemara cites a series of verses which present difficulties with regard to the claim that animals purchased from gentiles may not be used as offerings. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following verse: <b>“And Moses said: You must also give into our hand offerings and burnt-offerings</b> that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God” (Exodus 10:25). Moses demanded that Pharaoh provide the Jews with offerings, despite the fact that he was a gentile. The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> <b>prior to the giving of the Torah</b> was <b>different,</b> as at that time it was acceptable to use animals taken from gentiles as offerings. |
| Exodus 10:25 | but isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt- | Chagigah 10b:3 | Abaye responded: <b>However, if that is so,</b> consider <b>that it is written:</b> “Let My people go, <b>that they may hold a feast [<i>veyaḥogu</i>] to Me in the wilderness”</b> (Exodus 5:1). <b>So too,</b> the meaning of this verse <b>is that</b> they will merely <b>celebrate a Festival,</b> and not bring an offering. <b>And if you would say that is</b> indeed <b>so,</b> that this means that they should celebrate a Festival, <b>but isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-</b>offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God” (Exodus 10:25)? This shows that the command is referring to offerings. |
| Exodus 10:25 | But isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices [ zevaḥim ] and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God” | Zevachim 116a:18 | With regard to the opinion that the descendants of Noah did not sacrifice peace offerings, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>] and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God”</b> (Exodus 10:25)? This indicates that sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>], i.e., peace offerings, were sacrificed before the Torah was given. The Gemara answers: In this context, <b>“<i>zevaḥim</i>”</b> is referring to animals to be used <b>for consumption,</b> as the word <i>zevaḥ</i> can also be translated as an animal for slaughter, <b>and “burnt offerings”</b> is referring to animals to be used <b>for sacrifice.</b> |
| Exodus 11:2 | “Speak, please [ na ] in the ears of the people, | Berakhot 9a:29 | Since the last topic discussed in the Gemara revolved around the exodus from Egypt, the Gemara cites additional aggadic midrash on that subject. With regard to the verse: <b>“Speak, please [<i>na</i>] in the ears of the people,</b> and they should borrow, every man from his fellow and every woman from her fellow, silver and gold vessels” (Exodus 11:2), the word please [na] is unclear. The students of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Please</b> [<b><i>na</i>] is nothing more than an expression of supplication.</b> Why would God employ an expression of supplication in approaching Israel? The Gemara explains that the <b>Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses</b>: <b>I beseech you, go and tell Israel: I beseech you; borrow vessels of silver and vessels of gold from the Egyptians</b> in order to fulfill the promise I made to Abraham in the “Covenant between the Pieces,” <b>so that</b> |
| Exodus 11:4 | About midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt” | Berakhot 3b:27 | When King David said: At midnight I rise, the assumption is that he rose precisely at midnight. The Gemara asks: <b>Did David know</b> exactly <b>when it was midnight? Even Moses our teacher did not know</b> exactly when it was midnight. How do we know this about Moses? <b>As it is written</b> that he said to Pharaoh: “Thus said the Lord: <b>About midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 11:4). The word about indicates that it was only an approximation. |
| Exodus 11:7 | rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue” | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Exodus 11:8 | “And all these, your servants, shall come down to me, and bow down to me, saying: | Menachot 98a:11 | The Gemara continues to discuss giving a king his due: <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The <b>fear of kingship should always be upon you,</b> even when the king does not deserve it, <b>as it is stated</b> that Moses said to Pharaoh, when he warned him about the forthcoming plague of the firstborn: <b>“And all these, your servants, shall come down to me, and bow down to me, saying:</b> Get out, you and all the people who follow you, and after that I will go out” (Exodus 11:8). Although ultimately Pharaoh would himself come to Moses, Moses mentioned only that Pharaoh’s servants would come to him, <b>whereas he did not say</b> this <b>to</b> Pharaoh <b>about</b> Pharaoh <b>himself,</b> because of giving a king his due. |
| Exodus 11:8 | “And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger” | Zevachim 102a:10 | The Gemara challenges the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: <b>And</b> is it true that for <b>every burning anger that</b> is stated <b>in the Torah, its effect is</b> also <b>stated? But isn’t it written</b> with regard to Moses: <b>“And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger”</b> (Exodus 11:8)? <b>And</b> Moses <b>did not say anything to</b> Pharaoh. <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Moses <b>slapped him and left.</b> |
| Exodus 11:8 | “And all these your servants shall come down unto me | Zevachim 102a:12 | With regard to the respect accorded to a king, <b>Rabbi Yannai says: Fear of</b> the <b>kingship should always be upon you,</b> even when the king does not deserve respect, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses said to Pharaoh: <b>“And all these your servants shall come down unto me</b> and bow down unto me, saying: Get you out, and all the people that follow you, and after that I will go out” (Exodus 11:8). He mentioned Pharaoh’s servants, <b>but he did not say</b> this <b>of</b> Pharaoh <b>himself,</b> even though this was the eventual outcome. Rather, he spoke to Pharaoh with the respect due to a king. |
| Exodus 12:1 | Say a prohibition. | Pesachim 42a:5 | In <b>the school</b> of <b>Rav they say</b> a slightly different explanation: The term: Saying, can be expounded as if it were written <b><i>lav emor</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Say a prohibition.</b> In other words, the verse indicates that Moses was instructed to inform the Jewish people of a prohibition. This teaches that any mitzva introduced by the word <i>leimor</i> should be treated as a prohibition. Since the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb are preceded by the phrase: “And the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the Land of Egypt saying” (Exodus 12:1), it can be inferred that the subsequent mitzvot are also prohibitions. |
| Exodus 12:2 | “This month will be for you the first of the months; | Berakhot 10b:9 | With regard to his intercalation of Nisan, the Gemara asks: <b>Did Hezekiah not</b> accept the <i>halakha</i>: <b>“This month will be for you the first of the months;</b> it shall be the first for you of the months of the year” (Exodus 12:2)? By inference, <b>this</b> first month <b>is Nisan, and no other</b> month <b>is Nisan.</b> How could Hezekiah add an additional Nisan in violation of Torah law? |
| Exodus 12:2 | As it is stated: “Of the months of the year” | Megillah 5a:10 | Having mentioned a teaching of Rabbi Abba in the name of Shmuel, the Gemara cites another of his statements: <b>And Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not count days to</b> make up <b>years,</b> i.e., a year is considered to be comprised of either twelve or thirteen lunar months, and not 365 days? <b>As it is stated: “Of the months of the year”</b> (Exodus 12:2), which indicates that <b>you count months to</b> make up <b>years, but you do not count days</b> to make up <b>years.</b> |
| Exodus 12:2 | as it is written: “This month shall be for you the beginning of months” | Menachot 29a:15 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Three matters were difficult for Moses</b> to comprehend precisely, <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed</b> them to <b>him with His finger, and these are</b> the three matters: The form of the <b>Candelabrum, and</b> the exact size of the <b>new moon, and</b> the impure <b>creeping animals.</b> The <b>Candelabrum</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And this is the work of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:4). The <b>new moon</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “This month shall be for you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The <b>creeping animals</b> were shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And these are they which are unclean for you</b> among the swarming things” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that God <b>also</b> showed Moses <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering, as it is stated: “Now this is that which you shall sacrifice upon the altar”</b> (Exodus 29:38), and slaughtering is the first ritual of sacrifice. |
| Exodus 12:2 | As it is stated: “Of the months of the year” | Nazir 7a:1 | The Gemara asks further: <b>But say</b> it is referring to <b>a year,</b> which can also be full or lacking. The Gemara responds: <b>Do we count</b> years <b>by days? Didn’t the Sages of Caesarea say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not count days toward years,</b> but that years are calculated according to months? <b>As it is stated: “Of the months of the year”</b> (Exodus 12:2). This teaches that <b>months are calculated to</b> comprise <b>years, but days are not</b> counted <b>toward years.</b> Therefore, only a month can be described as being completed by a particular day. |
| Exodus 12:2 | Pesaḥ , as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the beginning of the months, | Pesachim 6b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s</b> ruling? He explains <b>that Moses was standing on the first day</b> of Nisan <b>and warning about</b> the performance of <b>the</b> first <b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the beginning of the months,</b> the first of the months of the year” (Exodus 12:2). <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Speak to the entire congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take for them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses,</b> a lamb for each household” (Exodus 12:3). The Torah proceeds to detail the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed on the fourteenth day of that month. |
| Exodus 12:2 | the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months” | Rosh Hashanah20a:14 | § It was taught above that for various reasons a month can have an extra day added, even if the new moon was seen on the night before the thirtieth. The Gemara challenges this assumption: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra month to <b>a year for</b> some pressing communal <b>need, so too,</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to <b>a month for</b> some similar <b>need.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). This teaches that when there is a moon <b>like this, see</b> it <b>and sanctify</b> the month. When the new moon is seen, the month must be sanctified without delay. |
| Exodus 12:2 | “It shall be the first month of the year to you” | Rosh Hashanah7a:17 | § It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the first of Nisan is the New Year <b>for collection of</b> the <b>shekels</b> that had been collected in Adar and were used to purchase animals for communal offerings and other needs of the Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Yoshiya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “This is the burnt-offering of each month in its month throughout the months [<i>leḥodshei</i>] of the year”</b> (Numbers 28:14). The seemingly superfluous term: “Throughout the months [<i>leḥodshei</i>] of the year,” should be understood as follows: <b>The Torah is saying</b> here: <b>Renew [<i>ḥaddesh</i>]</b> the year <b>and bring an offering from the new collection</b> of the shekels. <b>And it is derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Nisan, as it is written</b> with regard to Nisan: <b>“It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2). |
| Exodus 12:2 | from Nisan, as it is written: “It shall be the first month of the year to you” | Rosh Hashanah8b:7 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let us learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and conclude that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Nisan, as it is written: “It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2), and there the reference is to Nisan. The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse about the Sabbatical Year, where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it, from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse in Deuteronomy above, where <b>months</b> are also <b>not</b> mentioned <b>with it. And</b> they <b>do not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse where <b>months are</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., “It shall be the first month of the year for you.” |
| Exodus 12:2 | “It shall be the first month of the year to you” | Rosh Hashanah9b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Nisan, as it is written</b> with regard to Nisan: <b>“It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse about the <i>orla</i>, where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it, from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse in Deuteronomy above, where <b>months are</b> also <b>not</b> mentioned <b>with it. And</b> they <b>do not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> as it appears in the verse where <b>months are</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., “It shall be the first month of the year for you.” |
| Exodus 12:2 | “This month shall be for you | Sanhedrin 12b:8 | <b>The Master said</b> above: Hezekiah requested compassion <b>because</b> the court, when intercalating the year, may <b>intercalate only Adar, and he intercalated Nisan during Nisan.</b> How could Hezekiah act in this way? <b>But doesn’t Hezekiah accept</b> the following interpretive tradition: The verse states: <b>“This month shall be for you</b> the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you” (Exodus 12:2). This teaches that <b>this</b> month is <b>Nisan, and another</b> month <b>cannot be Nisan.</b> Therefore, the court cannot add another month of Nisan. The Gemara answers: Hezekiah <b>erred with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that would later be expounded <b>by Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> The court <b>may not intercalate the year on the thirtieth day of Adar, since</b> although it is part of Adar, it is <b>fit to establish it</b> as the first day of <b>Nisan.</b> As the day that may be assigned as the New Moon of Nisan, it has the same status as does Nisan, and the year may not be intercalated then. |
| Exodus 12:2 | “This month | Sanhedrin 42a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who blesses the</b> new <b>month in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> it is <b>as if he greets the Face of the Divine Presence.</b> Alluding to this, it <b>is written here</b> concerning the sanctification of the new month: <b>“This month</b> shall be for you the beginning of months” (Exodus 12:2), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there,</b> where the Jewish people encountered the Divine Presence at the splitting of the sea: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). The term “this” is employed in both verses. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If the Jewish people merited to greet the Face of their Father in Heaven only</b> one time <b>each and every month,</b> it would <b>suffice for them,</b> since in the blessing of the moon there is an aspect of greeting the Divine Presence. <b>Abaye said: Therefore, we will say</b> the blessing <b>while standing,</b> in honor of the Divine Presence. |
| Exodus 12:2 | “This month shall be for you [ haḥodesh hazeh lakhem ]” | Shabbat 147b:11 | The Gemara relates that once <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh happened</b> to come <b>there,</b> to Phrygia and Deyomset, and <b>he was drawn after them,</b> and <b>his</b> Torah <b>learning was forgotten. When he returned, he stood to read from a</b> Torah <b>scroll</b> and <b>was supposed to read</b> the verse: <b>“This month shall be for you [<i>haḥodesh hazeh lakhem</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:2), but he had forgotten so much that he could barely remember how to read the Hebrew letters, and instead he read: <b>Have their hearts become deaf</b> [<b><i>haḥeresh haya libbam</i>],</b> interchanging the similar letters <i>reish</i> for <i>dalet</i>, <i>yod</i> for <i>zayin</i>, and <i>beit</i> for <i>khaf</i>. <b>The Sages</b> prayed and <b>asked for</b> God to have <b>mercy on him, and his learning was restored.</b> |
| Exodus 12:2 | And it is written there: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months; | Shabbat 86b:5 | <b>The Sages taught: On the sixth</b> day <b>of the month</b> of Sivan, <b>the Ten Commandments were given to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says: On the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> the month. <b>Rava said: Everyone agrees</b> that the Jews <b>came to the Sinai desert on the New Moon,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, <b>the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai”</b> (Exodus 19:1), without elaborating what day it was. <b>And it is written there: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months;</b> it shall be the first month of the year to you” (Exodus 12:2). <b>Just as there,</b> the term “this” is referring to the <b>New Moon, so too, here</b> the term is referring to the <b>New Moon. And</b> similarly, <b>everyone agrees that the Torah was given to the Jewish people on Shabbat,</b> as <b>it is written here</b> in the Ten Commandments: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8), <b>and it is written there: “And Moses said to the people: Remember this day,</b> in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place; there shall be no leaven eaten” (Exodus 13:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of the Exodus, <b>so too, here</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of Shabbat. <b>Where</b> Rabbi Yosei and the Sages <b>disagree</b> is <b>with regard to the determination of the month,</b> meaning which day of the week was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yosei held:</b> The <b>New Moon was established on the first day of the week, and on the first day of the week He did not say anything to them due to the weariness</b> caused by <b>the journey. On the second day of the week, He said to them: “And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests</b> and a holy nation; these are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:6). |
| Exodus 12:3 | a lamb” | Bekhorot 12a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the first clause of <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey: “And you shall redeem a firstborn donkey with <b>a lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man <b>a lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:3). By inference, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the Torah <b>excludes all of these names,</b> i.e., all of these types of animals listed in the mishna, from being fit for sacrifice as a Paschal offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey, the Torah <b>excludes all of these names.</b> |
| Exodus 12:3 | from here: “And they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household” | Kiddushin 42a:3 | <b>Rather,</b> he derives agency with regard to offerings <b>from here: “And they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household”</b> (Exodus 12:3). This demonstrates that one person takes a lamb and slaughters it on behalf of the entire family. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps there too</b> there is agency <b>since</b> the one slaughtering the animal <b>has partnership with them?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses</b> to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in this verse <b>is not applicable for where it belongs,</b> i.e., with regard to an agent who is a partner in the offering, <b>apply it to where it does not belong,</b> so that even one who does not have a share in the offering can act as an agent. |
| Exodus 12:3 | “A lamb for each father’s house, | Nedarim 36a:10 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The verse states: <b>“A lamb for each father’s house,</b> a lamb for the household” (Exodus 12:3). From here it is derived that all members of a household, including minor sons and daughters, are registered to the group eating a Paschal lamb. However, this is a custom; it <b>is not by Torah law.</b> |
| Exodus 12:3 | “Speak to the entire congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take for them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, | Pesachim 6b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s</b> ruling? He explains <b>that Moses was standing on the first day</b> of Nisan <b>and warning about</b> the performance of <b>the</b> first <b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the beginning of the months,</b> the first of the months of the year” (Exodus 12:2). <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Speak to the entire congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take for them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses,</b> a lamb for each household” (Exodus 12:3). The Torah proceeds to detail the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed on the fourteenth day of that month. |
| Exodus 12:3 | a lamb for a household” | Pesachim 88a:6 | We learned in the mishna: In the case of <b>an orphan</b> with multiple guardians, if each of his <b>guardians slaughtered</b> a Paschal lamb <b>on his behalf,</b> he may <b>eat in</b> whichever <b>place he wishes.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>You can learn from it</b> that <b>there is retroactive clarification,</b> and one’s ultimate decision as to which group he wishes to be part of retroactively indicates that from the outset he was registered in that group. This is problematic, as no halakhic conclusion has been reached in the matter of retroactive clarification. The Gemara therefore rejects this suggestion: <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is not based on retroactive clarification, but rather on the following principle: The verse states: “They shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, <b>a lamb for a household”</b> (Exodus 12:3), indicating that a minor’s membership in the household is sufficient for him to be registered in the household’s Paschal lamb <b>in any case,</b> even without his agreement. |
| Exodus 12:3 | “They shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, | Pesachim 91b:8 | The Gemara clarifies the source for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that women are excluded also from the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And what is</b> the verse that employs the term <b>“man” that Rabbi Shimon spoke</b> of with regard to the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>? <b>If we say</b> that he is referring to the verse: <b>“They shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses,</b> a lamb for a household” (Exodus 12:3), this is incorrect, because <b>he needs that</b> verse <b>for</b> the derivation of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said:</b> We learn from that verse that only <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>can acquire</b> an object on behalf of others; but <b>a minor cannot acquire</b> on behalf of others. |
| Exodus 12:3 | As it is written: “Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take | Pesachim 96a:7 | The Gemara discusses the meaning of this difficult phrase, as obviously, the Paschal lamb is slaughtered on the fourteenth and eaten on the evening of the fifteenth. <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> conclude that the requirements of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt do not apply to later generations? <b>As it is written: “Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month they shall take</b> to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household” (Exodus 12:3); and we derive from the superfluous word “this” that <b>this</b> Paschal lamb offered in Egypt had to be <b>taken from the tenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and the Paschal lamb of</b> later <b>generations is not taken from the tenth</b> of Nisan. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “According to every man’s eating | Kiddushin 42a:4 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>This</b> verse <b>is required for him to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This verse is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>can acquire</b> an item on behalf of others, <b>but</b> that <b>a minor cannot acquire</b> an item on behalf of others. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that only an adult can acquire an item on behalf of others, <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). By employing the term “man,” which indicates an adult, the verse teaches that only an adult can acquire an item on behalf of others. |
| Exodus 12:4 | As the Sages taught | Pesachim 61a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> which are not explicitly written in the Torah, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor who is close to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). <b>“According to the number of” teaches that the Paschal lamb is slaughtered only for those who have registered for it.</b> Everything is done according to the number of people who have registered before the slaughtering. |
| Exodus 12:4 | according to every man’s eating | Pesachim 78b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written:</b> “And if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor who is close to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; <b>according to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4)? This indicates that the Torah requires one to eat the Paschal lamb. The Gemara responds: This verse is stated <b>as a mitzva</b> only. It should be fulfilled, but it does not preclude acceptance of the offering. |
| Exodus 12:4 | to withdraw | Pesachim 89a:22 | We learned in the mishna: People can <b>be registered and withdraw themselves from</b> being registered for a Paschal lamb <b>until it is slaughtered.</b> Rabbi Shimon says: Even until the priest sprinkles the blood. The Gemara discusses the scope of the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon: <b>Abaye said: The dispute</b> is only with regard to when one is able <b>to withdraw</b> from being registered. Both sides derive their opinions from the following verse: “And if the household be too little for a lamb [<i>miheyot miseh</i>], then shall he and his neighbor next to his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase <i>miheyot miseh</i> literally means: From being from a lamb. It is exegetically interpreted to refer to withdrawing from being registered for a lamb. |
| Exodus 12:4 | if the household be too little for a lamb, | Pesachim 90a:12 | <b>What is</b> this teaching of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that Abaye alluded to? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if the household be too little for a lamb,</b> then shall he and his neighbor next to his house take one” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “if the household be too little” is taken to mean the household cannot afford the basic necessities of the Festival. Continuing this interpretation, the phrase “for a lamb [<i>miheyot miseh</i>]” is then taken to mean: <b>sustain him [<i>haḥayeihu</i>] from the lamb,</b> i.e., he may use the Paschal lamb as a means of supporting himself. He takes money from his neighbor in return for registering his neighbor for a portion of his Paschal lamb and then uses that money to purchase his needs. However, this applies only if one lacks <b>sufficient means to</b> purchase food to <b>eat,</b> but <b>not</b> if he lacks only <b>sufficient means to purchase</b> other items. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “According to every man’s eating | Pesachim 91a:14 | <b>And for Rabbi Yosei, from where</b> does he know that the phrase “in any one” should be expounded <b>as Rabbi Shimon said</b> it should be? <b>Perhaps it comes</b> to teach what <b>Rabbi Yehuda said?</b> Rabbi Yosei could have <b>said to you: This cannot enter your mind, because it is written</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>“According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). Since the verse states “man” in the singular, it indicates that the Paschal lamb can be slaughtered even for an individual. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “According to the number of the souls | Pesachim 91b:3 | <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that they disagree about how to interpret the various verses that refer to the first and second <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the use of the word souls in the verse: <b>“According to the number of the souls</b>…you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4), includes everyone, <b>and even women,</b> in the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>if so, even on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, women should <b>also</b> be included, but <b>it is written</b> with regard to one who had not offered a Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> and then neglected to bring one on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>“That man shall bear his sin”</b> (Numbers 9:13), which indicates that <b>a man, yes,</b> he is liable for not having brought a Paschal lamb on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, but <b>a woman, no,</b> she is not liable. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “According to every man’s eating | Pesachim 91b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rabbi Shimon derived his <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). This is problematic. <b>Since Rabbi Yosei holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a Paschal lamb cannot be offered on an improvised altar, presumably <b>Rabbi Shimon also holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei,</b> that a Paschal lamb can be slaughtered for an individual. If so, Rabbi Shimon <b>needs that</b> verse, “according to every man’s eating,” in order to teach <b>that we may slaughter the Paschal lamb for an individual,</b> since that verse is the source of Rabbi Yosei’s <i>halakha</i>. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “And if the household be too little for a lamb” | Pesachim 99a:2 | The mishna addressed the question of what <b>two</b> individuals <b>whose Paschal lambs were intermingled</b> should do. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse which states: <b>“And if the household be too little for a lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:4) <b>teaches that</b> the members of the group <b>may keep decreasing,</b> meaning it is permissible for them to withdraw from the offering, <b>provided one of the</b> original <b>members of the group remains;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is permissible for them to withdraw <b>provided they do not leave the Paschal lamb</b> for any amount of time <b>on its own,</b> without anyone registered for it. In the mishna, the two original owners forego their shares in their own Paschal lambs, and the only remaining members of each group are people who were added from the marketplace, who were not original owners from the time the animal was separated as a Paschal lamb. This is apparently not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. |
| Exodus 12:4 | as it is stated: “According to every man’s eating | Sukkah 42b:3 | If he is one who <b>is able to eat an olive-bulk of roasted</b> meat, <b>one slaughters the Paschal lamb on his</b> behalf, and he is included in the group assembled to eat the Paschal lamb, <b>as it is stated: “According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Ability to consume an olive-bulk is insufficient to include him in the group; rather, he is not included <b>until he is able to discern</b> what he is <b>eating. How</b> is that determined? If <b>one gives him a pebble and he throws it</b> away, and if one gives him <b>a nut and he takes it,</b> he may be included in the group for eating the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “And if the household be too little for a lamb, | Temurah 30b:19 | <b>Rav Hoshaya says:</b> This is referring <b>to one who registers</b> the prostitute <b>for his Paschal offering</b> (see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 61a), giving her a portion in it as payment for her services, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that a Paschal offering is considered one’s personal property for the purposes of allowing additional people to register for it. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And if the household be too little for a lamb,</b> then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “if the household be too little” is interpreted to mean that the household cannot afford the basic necessities of the Festival. |
| Exodus 12:4 | for a lamb [ mehiyot miseh ], | Yoma 49b:6 | He answered him: <b>It is different there, as it is written:</b> “And if the household is too small <b>for a lamb [<i>mehiyot miseh</i>],</b> he and his neighbor who is next to his house” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “<i>mehiyot miseh</i>” is read as <b><i>meiḥiyutei deseh</i>,</b> from the life of a lamb. In other words, one can withdraw from a group only as long as the lamb is alive. If so, its blood is not considered part of the Paschal lamb by a special decree of the Torah, which does not apply to Yom Kippur. |
| Exodus 12:4 | “lamb” | Yoma 49b:7 | <b>Mar Zutra raised an objection: And one may not redeem</b> a male firstborn donkey <b>with a calf, nor with an undomesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered</b> lamb, <b>nor with an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], nor with</b> the product of the prohibited <b>crossbreeding</b> of a lamb and a goat, <b>nor with a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both a domesticated animal and a non-domesticated animal, <b>but with a lamb.</b> This proves that a slaughtered animal is not considered a lamb. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>It is different there, as</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy of <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13) and <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:4) <b>from the Paschal offering:</b> Just as a slaughtered lamb cannot be used for a Paschal offering, the same applies to the case of a firstborn donkey. |
| Exodus 12:4 | according to his eating, | Zevachim 23a:1 | <b>according to his eating,</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4)? This teaches that one may bring the Paschal offering only if he is able to partake of it. The Gemara responds: This requirement is also meant <b>as a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>; it does not disqualify the offering if not fulfilled. |
| Exodus 12:5 | year | Bekhorot 12a:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the Paschal offering, then perhaps <b>just as there,</b> the Paschal offering must be a lamb that is <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year</b> (Exodus 12:5), <b>so too here,</b> the lamb must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 13:13), and: <b>“You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20). This repetition serves to <b>include</b> female lambs, blemished lambs, and lambs that are beyond their first year. |
| Exodus 12:5 | “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male in its year” | Bekhorot 39b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the animal lacked a kidney <b>after</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood but <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>is it permitted</b> to be sacrificed upon the altar? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male in its year”</b> (Exodus 12:5), indicating <b>that it shall be unblemished</b> and <b>in its</b> first <b>year at the time of slaughter?</b> |
| Exodus 12:5 | “lamb” | Chullin 74b:13 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: What</b> is the reason for <b>your opinion?</b> Is it <b>because you derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of redeeming a firstborn donkey <b>from Paschal offerings</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13) written concerning a firstborn donkey and <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:5) written concerning a Paschal offering, and a <i>ben pekua</i> is unfit for sacrifice as a Paschal offering? |
| Exodus 12:5 | everywhere | Keritot 28a:27 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned, as in the verse: “You shall take it from the lambs or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b> |
| Exodus 12:5 | well | Shabbat 20a:4 | We learned in the mishna that <b>one may lower the Paschal lamb</b> into the oven on Shabbat eve <b>at nightfall.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that this was permitted? <b>Because the people of the group</b> who registered to be counted together for the offering and eating of the Paschal lamb <b>are vigilant</b> in the performance of mitzvot and they will not transgress the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>And if that was not so,</b> there would <b>not</b> be permission to do so? <b>Didn’t the Master say:</b> The meat of <b>a kid, whether</b> it is in an oven that is <b>sealed</b> or <b>whether</b> it is in one that is <b>not sealed,</b> everyone agrees that he may <b>well</b> place it in the oven at nightfall because taking it out of the oven harms it, and there is no room for concern that he will do so? If so, there is no room for concern with regard to the meat of the Paschal lamb, which must be either a goat or a lamb (Exodus 12:5). The Gemara answers: In any case, it is necessary to emphasize the vigilance of the members of the group, as <b>there,</b> where it was permitted, it was specifically in a case that the goat <b>was cut</b> into pieces. However, <b>here,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the goat <b>is not cut</b> into pieces. It is roasted whole, in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb. Consequently, it does not roast quickly, and there is room for concern lest he stoke the coals in order to accelerate the roasting. However, since the members of the group are vigilant, the Sages permitted it. |
| Exodus 12:5 | “A lamb without blemish, a male of the first year | Zevachim 25b:15 | <b>Rava says: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the Paschal offering, an offering of lesser sanctity: The verse states: <b>“A lamb without blemish, a male of the first year</b> it shall be for you” (Exodus 12:5), indicating <b>that it shall be unblemished and in its</b> first <b>year at the time of slaughter. From where</b> is it derived that it must also be without blemish <b>at</b> the time of <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>at</b> the time of <b>conveying</b> the blood to the altar, and <b>at</b> the time of the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? <b>The verse states: “It shall be,”</b> emphasizing that <b>all its happenings shall be only</b> when it is <b>unblemished and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> |
| Exodus 12:6 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, | Kiddushin 41b:15 | The Gemara poses a question with regard to the basic derivation of the <i>halakha</i> of agency: <b>This works out well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</b> who explains that the verse: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:6), teaches the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings. <b>But</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, who derives a different exposition from this verse, from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where do we</b> derive that <b>all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations |
| Exodus 12:6 | “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” | Kiddushin 41b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself? As it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Is it so</b> that <b>the whole assembly slaughters</b> the offering? <b>But only one</b> person from each group <b>slaughters</b> it. <b>Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself.</b> |
| Exodus 12:6 | “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” | Kiddushin 42a:1 | <b>with one Paschal offering?</b> Although it is impossible for all of the Jewish people to each eat an olive-bulk from one offering, they nevertheless fulfill their obligation to sacrifice the Paschal offering by sacrificing one animal, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Is it so that the whole assembly slaughters</b> it? <b>But only one</b> person from each group <b>slaughters. Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here that all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations <b>with one Paschal</b> offering, despite the fact that not everyone will be able to eat from it. Since Rabbi Yonatan derives from this verse that one offering suffices, <b>from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency with regard to offerings?</b> |
| Exodus 12:6 | “ bein ha’arbayim ” | Pesachim 108a:4 | <b>As</b> ben Beteira <b>maintained</b> that when the Torah says the Paschal lamb must be sacrificed <b>“<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:6), which literally means: Between the evenings, but is often rendered: In the afternoon, the term refers to any time <b>between the evening of yesterday and the current evening</b> of the fourteenth. In other words, as Rav Sheshet maintained that the reason one may not eat on Passover eve is to prevent him from being distracted from preparing the Paschal lamb, and he also maintained that the Paschal offering may be sacrificed during the entire day of the fourteenth of Nisan, therefore, he would not eat that entire day. |
| Exodus 12:6 | in the afternoon” | Pesachim 61a:6 | If one <b>slaughtered</b> the Paschal lamb <b>before midday it is disqualified, as it is stated:</b> “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it <b>in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). If he <b>slaughtered it before the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering it is valid, as long as another</b> person <b>stirs its blood</b> in order to prevent it from congealing <b>until the</b> blood of the <b>daily offering is sprinkled. And if</b> the blood of the Paschal lamb <b>is sprinkled</b> before the blood of the daily offering, <b>it is</b> nonetheless <b>valid,</b> as this change does not disqualify the offering. |
| Exodus 12:6 | as it is stated: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it | Pesachim 64a:11 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The Paschal lamb was slaughtered in three groups,</b> meaning those bringing the offering were divided into three separate sets, <b>as it is stated: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it</b> in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:6). The verse is interpreted as referring to three groups: <b>Assembly, congregation, and Israel.</b> The procedure for sacrificing the offering was as follows: <b>The first group</b> of people sacrificing the offering <b>entered,</b> and when <b>the Temple courtyard became filled</b> with them <b>they closed the doors of the Temple courtyard. They sounded uninterrupted, broken, and uninterrupted</b> trumpet <b>blasts,</b> as was done while sacrificing any offering. |
| Exodus 12:6 | with one Paschal lamb? The verse states: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” | Pesachim 78b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> is this referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that all Jews</b> may <b>fulfill</b> their obligation after the fact <b>with one Paschal lamb? The verse states: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). He asked: <b>And does the entire assembly slaughter</b> it? Is it a mitzva for each individual to slaughter his own Paschal lamb? <b>Is it not</b> true that <b>only one</b> person <b>slaughters</b> for the entire group? <b>Rather,</b> this formulation of the verse <b>teaches that all Jews</b> may <b>fulfill their obligation with one Paschal lamb.</b> It is considered as though they all slaughtered it and fulfilled their obligation, although they cannot all eat an olive-bulk of the offering. |
| Exodus 12:6 | “And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month” | Pesachim 96a:8 | The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> when the verse states later in the same section: <b>“And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month”</b> (Exodus 12:6), <b>so too</b> it should be inferred that <b>this</b> Paschal lamb in Egypt <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter, and no other</b> offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> |
| Exodus 12:6 | “And it shall be for you as a safeguard until the fourteenth day of this month” | Pesachim 96a:9 | <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: From where</b> do we know that <b>the daily offering requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter? It is stated</b> with regard to the daily offering: “Command the children of Israel, and say to them: My food which is presented to Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet flavor to Me, <b>you shall safeguard it to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), <b>and it states there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>“And it shall be for you as a safeguard until the fourteenth day of this month”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Just as</b> in the verse <b>there,</b> the Paschal lamb <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter, so too here,</b> the daily offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> There is no inference from the phrase “this month” that the requirement of examining an offering four days before is limited to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt. |
| Exodus 12:6 | in the afternoon [ bein ha’arbayim ]” | Zevachim 11b:23 | The Gemara asks: How can ben Beteira claim that a Paschal offering may be slaughtered in the morning? <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it <b>in the afternoon [<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:6)? |
| Exodus 12:6 | disqualified, because it is stated in its regard: “In the afternoon” | Zevachim 91a:17 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina</b> that an answer to this dilemma can be found in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 61a): If one <b>slaughtered</b> the Paschal offering <b>before midday</b> it is <b>disqualified, because it is stated in its regard: “In the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). If he slaughtered it <b>before the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> was slaughtered it is <b>valid,</b> even though the daily offering should be sacrificed first, <b>but</b> someone <b>should stir its blood</b> to prevent it from congealing <b>until</b> he slaughters and <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of the daily offering. Although the infrequent Paschal offering is already slaughtered, the priest first slaughters the frequent daily offering and then sprinkles the blood of the Paschal offering. |
| Exodus 12:7 | “Upon the houses wherein they shall eat it” | Pesachim 86a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: I<b>t is Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Upon the houses wherein they shall eat it”</b> (Exodus 12:7). This <b>teaches that</b> one <b>Paschal lamb may be eaten in two</b> separate <b>groups,</b> even if the groups eat it in separate houses. I <b>might</b> have thought that one person <b>who eats</b> from it <b>may eat</b> it <b>in two</b> separate <b>places; therefore, the Torah states: “In one house shall it be eaten [<i>ye’akhel</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:46). |
| Exodus 12:8 | “And they shall eat of the meat on that night; | Berakhot 9a:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This is not difficult</b> as these two sources reflect two conflicting opinions. <b>This,</b> our mishna, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. While this,</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb: <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night;</b> roasted over fire and <i>matzot</i> with bitter herbs shall they eat it” (Exodus 12:8); <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated: “On that night,”</b> from which we cannot determine when night ends. The same expression is encountered later in the same chapter: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from person to animal” (Exodus 12:12). We know when the firstborns were struck down based on the verse “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). Therefore, <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>below,</b> the striking of the firstborns took place <b>until midnight,</b> as stated explicitly in the verse, <b>so too</b> in the verse <b>here,</b> the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb continues <b>until midnight.</b> |
| Exodus 12:8 | “And they shall eat the meat on that night” | Megillah 21a:8 | The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include the eating of the Paschal offering,</b> and consequently this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: It is stated here: “On that night,” and it is stated further on: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:12). <b>Just as there,</b> when God passed through the land of Egypt, it was <b>until midnight, so too here,</b> the Paschal offering may be eaten only <b>until midnight.</b> The mishna, which asserts that the Paschal offering may be eaten all night, is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. |
| Exodus 12:8 | “And they shall eat of the meat on that night” | Pesachim 120b:5 | <b>Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8), <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated “on that night,”</b> from which it cannot be determined when the night ends. <b>And below it is stated: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). The Torah states with regard to the death of the firstborns: “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). |
| Exodus 12:8 | it is written: “Bitter herbs” | Pesachim 39a:13 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanin said to Abaye:</b> I can <b>say that</b> the <b>bitter herb</b> mentioned in the Torah includes merely <b>one</b> species, i.e., only the bitterest plant can be used for this obligation. Abaye responded: For this reason <b>it is written: “Bitter herbs”</b> (Exodus 12:8) in the plural, indicating that many types of bitter herbs are fit for this purpose. Rabba retorted: <b>But</b> one can <b>say that “bitter herbs”</b> refers to <b>two</b> different species, but no more. Abaye explained: Bitter herbs are <b>similar to <i>matza</i>; just as <i>matza</i></b> can be prepared from <b>many types</b> of grain, <b>so too, bitter herbs</b> can be taken from <b>many</b> different <b>types</b> of vegetables. |
| Exodus 12:8 | the verse to state: “Roasted with fire,” | Pesachim 41b:11 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way [<i>bashel mevushal</i>] in water, but roasted with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Roasted with fire,”</b> since the previous verse already said: “On this night you shall eat the meat roasted with fire” (Exodus 12:8), <b>what</b> then is the meaning when <b>the</b> second <b>verse states: “Roasted with fire”?</b> This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>at</b> the <b>time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is</b> also <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted,</b> whereas <b>at a time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is not included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted</b> either. |
| Exodus 12:8 | As it is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night, | Pesachim 41b:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night,</b> roasted with fire, and <i>matzot</i>; with bitter herbs they shall eat it” (Exodus 12:8). The Gemara derives from this verse: <b>At night, yes,</b> the Paschal lamb may be eaten; however, <b>by day, no,</b> it may not be eaten in any manner. |
| Exodus 12:8 | “Roasted in fire” | Pesachim 76a:2 | <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If some <b>of the gravy of</b> the Paschal lamb <b>dripped onto the earthenware and returned to it, one</b> must <b>remove its place. It</b> might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that this is referring to <b>cold earthenware. Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said the upper one prevails,</b> it is <b>due to this</b> reason that <b>one</b> must <b>remove its place.</b> According to Rav’s view, <b>the gravy goes and heats the earthenware, and then the earthenware heats the gravy, and when the gravy returns to the Paschal lamb, the Paschal lamb becomes roasted from the heat of the earthenware, and the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Roasted in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:8), <b>and not roasted due to something else.</b> |
| Exodus 12:8 | “And they shall eat the meat on that night” | Pesachim 85a:2 | <b>And</b> as a proof, the Gemara cites that which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). This prohibition includes <b>both a bone in which there is marrow and a bone in which there is no marrow. How do I establish</b> the positive mitzva expressed in the verse: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8)? It is to be fulfilled exclusively <b>with meat that is on the bone.</b> |
| Exodus 12:8 | which is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night” | Pesachim 96a:13 | Once again the Gemara questions its assertion that the phrase “this month” stated in the context of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt indicates that its <i>halakhot</i> are not relevant to other offerings. <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> with regard to that <b>which is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8), <b>so too,</b> should it be inferred that <b>this</b> Paschal lamb offered in Egypt <b>was eaten at night and no other</b> Paschal lamb offered in later generations must <b>be eaten at night?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform</b> this <b>service</b> in this month” (Exodus 13:5), in order to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt apply to later generations as well. |
| Exodus 12:8 | it is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. As it is taught | Zevachim 57b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The Paschal offering is eaten only</b> at night and it is eaten only until midnight. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who taught this mishna? <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And they shall eat of the flesh on that night” (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: It is stated here: “On that night,”</b> without stating when the night ends. <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to the plague that afflicted the firstborn Egyptians: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). With regard to the death of the firstborns the Torah states: “So said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). |
| Exodus 12:9 | dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda | Bava Metzia115b:2 | § The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava,</b> in another dispute, <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of this <b>dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda</b> concerning the collateral? The Torah commands with regard to the preparation of the Paschal offering: “Do not eat of it raw, nor cooked in water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with the innards thereof” (Exodus 12:9). Abaye and Rava engage in a dispute concerning the case of one who ate the meat when it was not properly roasted. |
| Exodus 12:9 | “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way” | Chullin 115a:10 | § <b>Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited</b> for consumption? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way,”</b> since it could simply have stated: “Boiled.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way?”</b> It is included <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is another</b> manner of <b>cooking,</b> the product of <b>which is</b> prohibited <b>like this one. And which</b> cooking <b>is this? This is meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b> |
| Exodus 12:9 | the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water” | Pesachim 41a:14 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> if <b>one roasted</b> the Paschal lamb <b>fully, he</b> should <b>be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water”</b> (Exodus 12:9). This verse teaches that <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that the Paschal lamb is prohibited if it is <b>partially roasted or boiled in any way, but not</b> if <b>it is fully roasted.</b> One who roasts the Paschal lamb fully has not violated a prohibition. |
| Exodus 12:9 | the verse states: “But roasted with fire” | Pesachim 41a:17 | I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that it is permitted</b> to eat it raw <i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But roasted with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:9). This teaches that the mitzva is to roast the Paschal lamb with fire, <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of cooking that are defined as <b><i>na</i>,</b> partially roasted? <b>Rav said: As the Persians say: <i>Avarnim</i>,</b> half roasted. |
| Exodus 12:9 | not boil | Pesachim 41a:6 | The mishna taught that <b>one</b> may <b>not boil</b> the Paschal lamb in liquid. To explain this issue, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with the innards in it” (Exodus 12:9). <b>The Sages taught: “In water”; I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the prohibition against boiling the Paschal lamb <b>in water. From where</b> do I know that it is likewise prohibited to boil it in <b>other liquids?</b> |
| Exodus 12:9 | lashes, | Pesachim 41b:1 | he <b>receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for violating the prohibitions: “You shall not eat it partially roasted” (Exodus 12:9) and: “You shall only eat it…roasted with fire” (Exodus 12:9). One who ate it <b>boiled receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for the prohibitions: “Nor shall it be boiled in any way in water” (Exodus 12:9), and “You shall only eat it…roasted with fire.” One who ate the Paschal lamb after it had been <b>partially roasted and</b> then <b>boiled receives three</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for eating the Paschal lamb partially roasted, for eating it boiled, and for failing to eat it roasted. |
| Exodus 12:9 | the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way [ bashel mevushal ] in water, but roasted with fire” | Pesachim 41b:11 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way [<i>bashel mevushal</i>] in water, but roasted with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Roasted with fire,”</b> since the previous verse already said: “On this night you shall eat the meat roasted with fire” (Exodus 12:8), <b>what</b> then is the meaning when <b>the</b> second <b>verse states: “Roasted with fire”?</b> This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>at</b> the <b>time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is</b> also <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted,</b> whereas <b>at a time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is not included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted</b> either. |
| Exodus 12:9 | it is written: “You shall not eat it partially roasted” | Pesachim 41b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>partially roasted</b> meat, <b>it is written: “You shall not eat it partially roasted”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>However,</b> with regard to meat that has been <b>roasted, from where do we</b> derive that one who eats it before the proper time has committed a transgression? |
| Exodus 12:9 | “Do not eat from it raw” | Pesachim 95b:1 | <b>what is it including,</b> beyond what is mentioned explicitly in the verse? The Gemara answers that it includes the mitzva: <b>“Do not eat from it raw”</b> (Exodus 12:9). The Gemara asks: <b>What does it exclude through its detail?</b> The Gemara answers that it excludes the mitzva: <b>“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread”</b> (Exodus 34:25). The Gemara asks: Perhaps <b>I</b> can <b>reverse it</b> and say the opposite, that the prohibition against eating the offering raw is excluded, and the prohibition against owning leaven is included. The Gemara answers: Including <b>a mitzva related to</b> the Paschal lamb <b>itself is preferable</b> to including one that does not relate as directly to the Paschal lamb. Therefore, the prohibition against eating the Paschal lamb raw is included, and the prohibition against slaughtering the Paschal lamb with leaven in one’s possession is excluded. |
| Exodus 12:9 | which is written: “Do not eat of it raw, | Pesachim 96a:23 | The Gemara asks further: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> from that <b>which is written: “Do not eat of it raw,</b> nor boiled in water, but roasted in fire” (Exodus 12:9), should it be inferred that it is only <b>of it,</b> the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, <b>that you</b> may <b>not eat</b> raw, <b>but you</b> may <b>eat raw</b> meat <b>from the Paschal lamb of</b> later <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform,”</b> which teaches that the prohibition applies to later generations as well. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the qualifying expression <b>“in it”?</b> The Gemara answers that it is necessary <b>for that which Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said,</b> that this verse serves as the basis of a verbal analogy which teaches that an uncircumcised man may not eat tithes. |
| Exodus 12:9 | “of it” | Yevamot 71a:4 | The Gemara asks: With regard to the phrase <b>“of it”</b> in the verse “Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled in water, but roasted in fire” (Exodus 12:9), and the phrase <b>“of it”</b> in the verse “And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning” (Exodus 12:10), both of which are terms of exclusion, <b>why do I</b> need them? The Gemara answers that they are necessary <b>for that which Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said,</b> as will be explained later (74a). |
| Exodus 12:9 | of it | Yevamot 74a:10 | The Gemara further comments on this issue. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, too, maintains</b> that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man is <b>prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe? It is stated:</b> “And I did not consume <b>of it</b> while impure” (Deuteronomy 26:14) <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, and it is stated:</b> “Do not eat <b>of it</b> raw” (Exodus 12:9) <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb. Just as</b> in the case of <b>the Paschal lamb,</b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it, so too,</b> in the case of second <b>tithe,</b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | “It should not remain until the morning” | Berakhot 9a:20 | The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>derives</b> this conclusion <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“It should not remain until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:10). If one is prohibited from leaving over any part of the sacrifice until the morning, he is certainly prohibited from leaving it over until the following night. Therefore, it is unnecessary to cite an additional source to teach that the Paschal lamb may only be eaten on the first night. |
| Exodus 12:10 | you shall burn in fire” | Chullin 141b:5 | <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;</b> but that which remains of it until the morning <b>you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position the positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, in order <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | you shall not leave any of it until morning; but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” | Chullin 82b:19 | <b>As</b> that other <i>tanna</i> <b>says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds: <b>An uncertain forewarning is considered a forewarning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: “And <b>you shall not leave any of it until morning; but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). |
| Exodus 12:10 | “And you shall not leave any of it until morning; | Chullin 91a:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning;</b> but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive mitzva</b> to burn the leftover meat <b>after</b> it has taught <b>a prohibition</b> against leaving it over, <b>to say that one is not flogged for</b> violation <b>of</b> the prohibition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds that one is not flogged for any transgression that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva. |
| Exodus 12:10 | “And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning | Makkot 16a:2 | The Gemara adds: <b>And both</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning</b> you shall burn in fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover flesh <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the flesh, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yoḥanan inferred this</b> from the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>The reason</b> he is not flogged is <b>that the verse comes</b> and positions the mitzva after the prohibition; <b>but</b> if <b>the verse</b> had <b>not come</b> and positioned the mitzva after the prohibition, he would have been <b>flogged. Apparently, uncertain forewarning is characterized as forewarning,</b> as he can be forewarned not to leave over the flesh of the offering, even though he would not be flogged were he to burn it. |
| Exodus 12:10 | “And you shall let nothing of it remain until morning, but that which remains of it until morning | Makkot 4b:3 | The Gemara comments: <b>There are those who teach this</b> statement <b>of Ulla with regard to that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall let nothing of it remain until morning, but that which remains of it until morning</b> you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive mitzva</b> to burn the remains <b>after</b> it has taught <b>a prohibition,</b> which states: “You shall let nothing of it remain,” <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This is a prohibition whose transgression entails the fulfillment of a positive mitzva, in which the mitzva serves to rectify the violation of the prohibition, and no lashes are administered. |
| Exodus 12:10 | remain until the morning; | Pesachim 120b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> from where might he derive the <i>halakha</i> that the Paschal lamb may not be eaten for two nights? Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya could have <b>said to you: This</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“You shall let nothing</b> of it <b>remain until the morning;</b> and that of it which remains until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). If it is prohibited to leave any part of the Paschal lamb until the morning, it is certainly prohibited to leave any of it until the following night. Therefore, it is unnecessary to cite an additional source to teach that the Paschal lamb may be eaten only on the first night. |
| Exodus 12:10 | the school of Ḥizkiya taught: The verse states: “And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” | Pesachim 83b:12 | <b>Ḥizkiya said, and similarly,</b> one of the Sages in <b>the school of Ḥizkiya taught: The verse states: “And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “until morning,”</b> and repeating that phrase adds nothing to the verse, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “until morning”?</b> It is <b>to give it a second morning for its burning.</b> In other words, it comes to teach that the mitzva to burn the leftover does not apply on the first morning, i.e., the morning of the Festival when they become prohibited to eat, but on the second morning, the sixteenth of Nisan. However, when the sixteenth falls on Shabbat, the burning is delayed until the seventeenth. |
| Exodus 12:10 | “And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and that which remains of it until morning | Pesachim 84a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna’s rulings: <b>Granted, one who leaves over</b> part <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal lamb is not flogged for having violated Torah law. There is good reason for this, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and that which remains of it until morning</b> you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive</b> mitzva to burn the leftover <b>after the prohibition</b> against leaving it over, <b>to say that one is not flogged</b> because any prohibition that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva does not carry a punishment of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | “And you shall not leave any of it until morning; | Sanhedrin 63a:29 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the Paschal offering: The verse states: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning;</b> but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive</b> mitzva to burn the leftover meat <b>after the prohibition</b> against leaving it over was violated, |
| Exodus 12:10 | you shall not leave any of it until morning; | Shabbat 133a:10 | <b>Ḥizkiya said, and likewise</b> one of the Sages <b>of the school of Ḥizkiya taught: The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And <b>you shall not leave any of it until morning;</b> but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). This verse contains a superfluous phrase, <b>as the Torah did not need to state until morning</b> the second time; it would have been sufficient to state: But that which remains of it you shall burn with fire. Rather, <b>why does the Torah state until morning? The verse comes to provide him</b> with <b>the second morning for burning.</b> Leftover meat of the Paschal lamb is not burned on the following morning, which is a Festival, but rather on the following day, the first of the intermediate days of the Festival. Even though the labor of kindling a fire is not entirely prohibited on a Festival, as one may cook and bake, it is derived from here that kindling a fire is permitted only for the purpose of preparing food for the immediate needs of the day and not for purposes that can be postponed until the intermediate days. Similarly, since circumcision involves a prohibited labor, it is permitted on the eighth day only when there is no option of postponing it. Otherwise, doing so is prohibited. |
| Exodus 12:10 | the verse said: “And you shall let nothing of it remain until morning; but that which remains of it until morning | Shabbat 24b:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that one may not light with burnt oil on a Festival, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>Because,</b> in general, <b>one may not burn consecrated items on a Festival.</b> With regard to the fundamental principle that one may not burn consecrated items on a Festival, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiya said, and</b> one of the Sages <b>from the school of Ḥizkiya taught the same,</b> that which <b>the verse said: “And you shall let nothing of it remain until morning; but that which remains of it until morning</b> you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10), requires explanation. <b>As the Torah did not need to state until morning</b> the second time. It would have been sufficient to state: But that which remains of it you shall burn with fire. Rather, <b>why does the Torah state until morning? The verse comes to provide him</b> with <b>the second morning for burning.</b> Leftover meat of the Paschal lamb is not burned on the following morning, which is a Festival, but rather on the following day, the first of the intermediate days of the Festival. From there it is derived that burning consecrated items on a Festival is prohibited. |
| Exodus 12:10 | you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn in fire” | Shevuot 3b:13 | The Gemara cites the source of Rabbi Yaakov’s and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinions: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, | Temurah 4b:9 | § Which prohibitions carry the punishment of lashes is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning the Paschal offering: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning,</b> but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to place a positive mitzva after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> in order <b>to say that one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Exodus 12:10 | “of it” | Yevamot 71a:4 | The Gemara asks: With regard to the phrase <b>“of it”</b> in the verse “Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled in water, but roasted in fire” (Exodus 12:9), and the phrase <b>“of it”</b> in the verse “And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning” (Exodus 12:10), both of which are terms of exclusion, <b>why do I</b> need them? The Gemara answers that they are necessary <b>for that which Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said,</b> as will be explained later (74a). |
| Exodus 12:10 | are written with regard to notar . One verse states: “You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, | Zevachim 36a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who deems the offering unfit if there was intent to leave it over until the next day or to take it out of its designated area? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There are <b>two verses</b> that <b>are written with regard to <i>notar</i>. One verse states: “You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning,</b> and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10), <b>and one verse states: “He shall not leave any of it until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If</b> the additional verse <b>is not</b> necessary for <b>the matter of</b> the prohibition <b>against leaving</b> it overnight, which is already mentioned by the first verse, <b>apply it to the matter of intent of leaving</b> it overnight, which would therefore be prohibited as well. |
| Exodus 12:11 | in haste | Berakhot 9a:15 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: Was it not already said,</b> “Thus you shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staffs in your hands and you will eat it <b>in haste</b> for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11)? Therefore the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>until the time of haste.</b> Since the time of haste is when Israel left Egypt, and it is said, “You will not leave, every man from his house, until the morning,” then the Paschal lamb may be eaten until dawn. <b>If that is so, why does the verse state: On</b> that <b>night?</b> |
| Exodus 12:11 | with regard to the time of haste, | Berakhot 9a:26 | However, <b>with regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagreed <b>with regard to the time of haste,</b> as it is written: “You will eat it in haste for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya held: What is</b> the meaning of <b>haste?</b> It is <b>the haste of the Egyptians</b> at midnight, as they hurried to the houses of the people of Israel to send them away, in fear of the plague of the firstborn. |
| Exodus 12:11 | in haste, | Pesachim 120b:7 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: <b>But wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated:</b> “Thus you shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staffs in your hands, and you will eat it <b>in haste,</b> for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11)? This verse indicates that the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>until the time of haste,</b> i.e., until dawn, as the Jewish people left Egypt the next day. |
| Exodus 12:11 | as the verse states: “You shall eat it in haste; | Pesachim 96a:24 | The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna, which stated that the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt <b>was eaten with haste</b> but that Paschal lambs sacrificed in later years were not. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the verse states: “You shall eat it in haste;</b> it is the Lord’s Paschal lamb” (Exodus 12:11). The word “it” indicates a detail and teaches that <b>“it” is eaten with haste, and no other</b> Paschal lamb <b>is eaten with haste.</b> |
| Exodus 12:11 | and you will eat it in haste, | Zevachim 57b:9 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: <b>But isn’t it</b> already <b>stated:</b> “And so you shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staffs in your hands, <b>and you will eat it in haste,</b> for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11)? This verse indicates that the Paschal offering may be eaten <b>until the time of haste,</b> i.e., until dawn, as the Jewish people left Egypt hastily the next morning. |
| Exodus 12:12 | “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night | Berakhot 9a:14 | <b>Rav Yosef said: This is not difficult</b> as these two sources reflect two conflicting opinions. <b>This,</b> our mishna, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. While this,</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb: <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night;</b> roasted over fire and <i>matzot</i> with bitter herbs shall they eat it” (Exodus 12:8); <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated: “On that night,”</b> from which we cannot determine when night ends. The same expression is encountered later in the same chapter: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from person to animal” (Exodus 12:12). We know when the firstborns were struck down based on the verse “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). Therefore, <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>below,</b> the striking of the firstborns took place <b>until midnight,</b> as stated explicitly in the verse, <b>so too</b> in the verse <b>here,</b> the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb continues <b>until midnight.</b> |
| Exodus 12:12 | Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: It is stated here: “On that night,” and it is stated further on: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night” | Megillah 21a:8 | The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include the eating of the Paschal offering,</b> and consequently this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: It is stated here: “On that night,” and it is stated further on: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:12). <b>Just as there,</b> when God passed through the land of Egypt, it was <b>until midnight, so too here,</b> the Paschal offering may be eaten only <b>until midnight.</b> The mishna, which asserts that the Paschal offering may be eaten all night, is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. |
| Exodus 12:12 | as it is written: “And against all the gods of Egypt | Nedarim 25a:9 | The Gemara responds: <b>No, idol worship is</b> also <b>called: God,</b> in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “And against all the gods of Egypt</b> I will execute judgments” (Exodus 12:12). Therefore, this would not have been a special stipulation in their minds but a misguided intention within the oath itself. Moses suspected this and therefore issued the warning. |
| Exodus 12:12 | And below it is stated: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night | Pesachim 120b:5 | <b>Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8), <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated “on that night,”</b> from which it cannot be determined when the night ends. <b>And below it is stated: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). The Torah states with regard to the death of the firstborns: “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). |
| Exodus 12:12 | There is no nation that is afflicted whose god is not afflicted with it, as it is stated: “And against all the gods of Egypt I will mete out judgment; I am God” | Sukkah 29a:12 | The Sages said: <b>There is no nation that is afflicted whose god is not afflicted with it, as it is stated: “And against all the gods of Egypt I will mete out judgment; I am God”</b> (Exodus 12:12). The Gemara adds: <b>When the Jewish people perform God’s will, they</b> need <b>not fear any of these</b> omens, <b>as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them”</b> (Jeremiah 10:2). <b>The nations will be dismayed, but the Jewish people will not be dismayed,</b> provided they do not follow the ways of the nations. |
| Exodus 12:12 | “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night | Zevachim 57b:7 | § The mishna teaches: <b>The Paschal offering is eaten only</b> at night and it is eaten only until midnight. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who taught this mishna? <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And they shall eat of the flesh on that night” (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: It is stated here: “On that night,”</b> without stating when the night ends. <b>And it is stated there,</b> with regard to the plague that afflicted the firstborn Egyptians: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). With regard to the death of the firstborns the Torah states: “So said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). |
| Exodus 12:15 | from the first day until the seventh day” | Arakhin 18a:18 | The Gemara provides the source of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the festival of Passover: The verse states: “For whoever eats leavened bread <b>from the first day until the seventh day”</b> (Exodus 12:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against eating leaven applies from the <b>first</b> day and onward <b>but</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is not included,</b> and likewise that the prohibition continues until the <b>seventh</b> day <b>but</b> the <b>seventh</b> day <b>is not included.</b> |
| Exodus 12:15 | who says: | Arakhin 24b:7 | Rather, <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that whenever the verse employs an expression such as: From the first day, the first day itself is not included. Accordingly, when the verse states: “If he sanctifies his field from the Jubilee Year,” the Jubilee Year is not included. <b>But I stated</b> my ruling that a field may be consecrated during the Jubilee Year <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says:</b> The verse states: “Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exodus 12:15). It states: “From the <b>first</b> day,” <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is included,</b> and it continues: “Until the <b>seventh</b> day,” <b>and</b> the <b>seventh</b> day is also <b>included. Here too,</b> the verse states: “If he sanctifies his field <b>from</b> the Jubilee <b>Year,” and the Jubilee Year is included.</b> |
| Exodus 12:15 | The verse states: | Chullin 120a:21 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One is liable even for drinking leavened bread. <b>The verse states:</b> “For all who eat leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exodus 12:15). The term <b>“soul”</b> is interpreted homiletically <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>one who drinks</b> leavened bread. |
| Exodus 12:15 | and one verse states: “Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread” | Menachot 66a:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> there is yet another proof: <b>One verse states: “Six days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), <b>and one verse states: “Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Exodus 12:15). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar explains that there is <b><i>matza</i> that you are unable to eat for</b> all <b>seven</b> days of Passover, due to the prohibition of harvesting and eating <b>from the new</b> crop of grain that ripened before Passover until after the <i>omer</i> offering. But <b>you are able to eat</b> that same <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, although it is <b>from the new</b> crop, as it is permitted after the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering on the second day of Passover. This resolution of the verses is possible only if the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, not on any other date. |
| Exodus 12:15 | yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses” | Pesachim 10b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one must conduct a search three times? The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna who both say:</b> The requirement to conduct three searches <b>corresponds to</b> the <b>three</b> times that <b>the removal</b> of leaven <b>is</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> One verse says: “<i>Matzot</i> shall be eaten for seven days, and <b>no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: <b>“Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), while a third verse says: “Seven days shall you eat <i>matzot</i>, <b>yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15). |
| Exodus 12:15 | it was intended to teach not just about itself but about the entire generalization. | Pesachim 120a:12 | <b>What is the reason</b> that it is optional to eat <i>matza</i> on the first six days of Passover as well as the seventh? The seventh day of Passover <b>is something that was included in a generalization but was explicitly singled out to teach.</b> According to the rules of exegesis, <b>it was intended to teach not just about itself but about the entire generalization.</b> In other words, the seventh day of Passover was initially included in the verse: “You shall eat <i>matzot</i> for seven days” (Exodus 12:15), but was excluded from this generalization by the verse: “Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>.” In accordance with the above principle, the <i>halakha</i> of the seventh day applies to all the other days of Passover as well. That means there is no obligation to eat <i>matza</i> for all seven days of the Festival, but only on the first day. |
| Exodus 12:15 | And the Torah said: “You shall remove leaven from your houses” | Pesachim 27b:9 | The Rabbis <b>said to him: Any logical derivation that you derive</b> whose <b>initial</b> teaching <b>is stringent but whose subsequent</b> consequences <b>are lenient is not</b> a valid <b>logical derivation.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, if one <b>did not find wood to burn</b> his leavened bread, must <b>he sit idly</b> and not remove it? <b>And the Torah said: “You shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15), indicating that this must be done <b>in any manner which you can remove it.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda’s logical derivation leads to a leniency. |
| Exodus 12:15 | the verse states: “Seven days you shall eat matzot ” | Pesachim 38b:2 | <b>Rav Yosef said</b> a different reason: One may not use <i>matza</i> prepared for a nazirite or a thanks-offering because <b>the verse states: “Seven days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:15), which indicates that one can fulfill his obligation only with <b><i>matza</i> that</b> can <b>be eaten for</b> all <b>seven days.</b> This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, which is of nazirite’s wafers or the loaves of a thanks-offering and <b>which cannot be eaten for seven days, but</b> only <b>for</b> one <b>day and</b> one <b>night.</b> |
| Exodus 12:15 | shall be cut off | Pesachim 43a:18 | The Gemara notes that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion: <b>“You shall eat nothing leavened;</b> in all your dwellings you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). The Sages taught: This verse comes <b>to include Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>, Median beer, Edomite vinegar, and Egyptian <i>zitom</i>.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one who eats any of these items <b>will be punishable</b> by <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For whoever eats leavened bread…</b>that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from Israel” (Exodus 12:15), from which the Sages derived: <b>For</b> eating <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread</b> one is <b>punished</b> with <b><i>karet</i>, but for</b> eating <b>its mixture</b> one is only in violation <b>of a prohibition.</b> |
| Exodus 12:15 | “Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses” | Pesachim 4b:9 | <b>Abaye said: Two verses are written,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is derived by comparing them. <b>It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Seven days, leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), indicating that throughout these seven days it is prohibited to maintain leaven in one’s house. <b>And it is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15), indicating that one must remove the leaven on the first day, after the Festival has begun. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> apparent contradiction be resolved? The Gemara responds: The latter verse comes <b>to include the fourteenth</b> day of Nisan with regard <b>to the elimination</b> of leaven. The phrase: On the first day, does not refer to the fifteenth of Nisan or to the beginning of the festival of Passover. It is referring to the fourteenth, the day on which the Paschal lamb is slaughtered. |
| Exodus 12:15 | “Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses” | Pesachim 5a:18 | The Gemara adds that some of the aforementioned opinions <b>were also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15). This prohibition is in effect <b>from the eve of the Festival. Or perhaps</b> that is <b>not</b> the case, but <b>it</b> applies <b>only to the Festival itself. The verse states: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My offering over leavened bread”</b> (Exodus 34:25), meaning that <b>you shall not slaughter the Paschal lamb while</b> your <b>leavened bread is still intact.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Exodus 12:15 | “for seven days you shall eat matza ” | Pesachim 5a:9 | The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>Here too, it is written</b> with regard to Passover: <b>“Yet on the first [<i>harishon</i>] day you shall remove</b> leaven from your houses”; <b>“for seven days you shall eat <i>matza</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:15). Just as seventh here is referring to the seventh day of the Festival, so too, <i>rishon</i> must refer to the first day of the Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>write <i>rishon</i>; why do I</b> need the addition of the definite article, <b><i>harishon</i>? Learn from it, as we said:</b> <i>Harishon</i> means the day before the Festival. |
| Exodus 12:16 | before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: One who slaughters a gift offering on a Festival is flogged | Beitzah 12a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> who reviews <i>mishnayot</i> <b>teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: One who slaughters a gift offering on a Festival is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “No manner of work shall be done on them” (Exodus 12:16). Since this slaughtering was not performed for the purpose of eating, the action constitutes a prohibited labor on a Festival. |
| Exodus 12:16 | for you” | Beitzah 20b:7 | <b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel in support of their own position: <b>But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that for you may food be prepared, <b>but not for the Most High? Beit Hillel said to them: But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “You shall observe it as a Festival <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), which teaches: <b>Anything</b> sacrificed <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles; for you, but not for dogs.</b> |
| Exodus 12:16 | for you” | Beitzah 21a:13 | Rav Yehuda ben Bava <b>said to him: I wonder if your gain,</b> that which you saved by preventing the soldiers from taking your possessions, <b>was not outweighed by your loss,</b> the punishment for your desecration of the Festival. <b>As the Torah states:</b> “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that food may be prepared for you, <b>but not for gentiles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava say this? <b>Wasn’t</b> some portion of the calf <b>fit to be eaten by them?</b> The conclusion seems to be that even if a Jew may eat from an animal, it may not be slaughtered on a Festival for the sake of a gentile. |
| Exodus 12:16 | that alone may be done for you” | Beitzah 28b:6 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i></b> for prohibiting actions that facilitate food preparation? <b>The verse states:</b> “Save that which every person must eat, <b>that alone may be done for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), from which it may be inferred: <b>“That”</b> may be done on a Festival, <b>but not</b> actions that <b>facilitate it. And Rabbi Yehuda</b> adduces proof for his view from the fact that <b>the verse states: “For you,”</b> indicating: <b>For you, for all your needs,</b> and that which facilitates food preparation is also a need. |
| Exodus 12:16 | “Save that which every person must eat, | Ketubot 7a:6 | Rav Pappa <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>about your</b> assertion that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Festival: <b>“Save that which every person must eat,</b> that alone may be done by you” (Exodus 12:16), indicating <b>a matter that is equal for every person.</b> Incense is burned only by those who are particularly delicate. It is not equally utilized by everyone, and therefore it is not permitted. Intercourse, on the other hand, is universally practiced. |
| Exodus 12:16 | verse states: | Megillah 7b:13 | The Gemara elaborates. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is as the <b>verse states:</b> “Except that which every person must eat, only that may be done for you” (Exodus 12:16). <b>“That”</b> is permitted, <b>and not</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> it. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: “For you”</b> means <b>for you, for all your needs.</b> |
| Exodus 12:16 | for you” | Pesachim 47a:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of the two loaves, <b>as the verse says:</b> “No kind of labor shall be done on them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16). This indicates that it is permitted to cook and bake only <b>“for you,”</b> i.e., for human consumption, <b>and not for the</b> One <b>above,</b> namely for the Temple service. |
| Exodus 12:16 | you shall perform no manner of work | Pesachim 5a:19 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says: There is no need</b> for this proof, <b>as it says: “Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses,” and it is written:</b> “And on the first day there shall be to you a sacred convocation, and on the seventh day a sacred convocation; <b>you shall perform no manner of work</b> on them” (Exodus 12:16). <b>And we found that kindling</b> a fire <b>is a primary category of</b> prohibited <b>labor.</b> Since the fire in which the leaven is burned is not for the preparation of food, kindling it is not performed for the purpose of the Festival. Therefore, it is prohibited to burn the leaven on the Festival itself. Consequently, one must burn the leaven on the day before the Festival. |
| Exodus 12:16 | only that may be done for you” | Pesachim 83b:14 | <b>Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>The verse states</b> concerning Festivals: “And on the first day there shall be a sacred convocation; no kind of labor shall be done on them, save that which every man must eat, <b>only that may be done for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16). From this verse one can infer the following: <b>That,</b> i.e., the food itself, you may prepare, <b>but</b> you may <b>not</b> perform acts that <b>facilitate its</b> preparation, which must be done beforehand. The word <b>only</b> is also exclusive; it indicates that only food preparation is permitted, |
| Exodus 12:16 | that alone may be done for you” | Shabbat 133a:12 | <b>Rava said</b> there is a different proof, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Festivals: “And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat; <b>that alone may be done for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16). The superfluous term <b>“that”</b> in the verse teaches the following: That which is necessary for food preparation itself is permitted <b>and not</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> food preparation or which prepare utensils necessary for eating. Similarly, “that <b>alone</b> may be done” teaches: Only food preparation may be performed <b>and not circumcision that is not at its</b> appointed <b>time, which</b> could have been <b>derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.</b> Therefore, the verse emphasizes that “that alone” may be performed, to teach that prohibited labors are permitted for sustenance on a Festival, and are not permitted for other mitzvot. |
| Exodus 12:16 | that alone may be done by you” | Shabbat 24b:8 | <b>Rava said:</b> This is derived from a different verse, as <b>the verse said</b> with regard to the laws of a Festival: “No manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, <b>that alone may be done by you”</b> (Exodus 12:16). From the word <b>that,</b> it is derived that for sustenance, one is permitted to perform prohibited labor on a Festival, <b>but not</b> for <b>facilitators</b> of sustenance. Although cooking is permitted, actions that involve prohibited labors for the purpose of facilitating cooking are prohibited. From the word <b>alone,</b> it is derived: <b>And not circumcision</b> performed <b>not at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> i.e., a circumcision may be performed on a Festival only if it is on the eighth day. A circumcision that was postponed may not be performed on a Festival. It is possible <b>that</b> license to perform the postponed circumcision on a Festival could have been <b>derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.</b> Therefore, the verse explicitly prohibited doing so. The same is true with regard to burning consecrated items. Although the Torah commands burning consecrated items, it was not permitted on a Festival since there is no obligation to do so specifically on that day. |
| Exodus 12:17 | “And you shall observe the festival of matzot ” | Chagigah 11b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so,</b> then what of <b>that which is written: “And you shall observe the Shabbat”</b> (Exodus 31:14), and <b>“And you shall observe the festival of <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17), and <b>“And you shall observe the charge of the sacred things”</b> (Numbers 18:5); <b>so too,</b> will you say that none of these subjects may be taught to three? |
| Exodus 12:17 | Passover, as it is written: “And you shall watch over the matzot ” | Menachot 53a:10 | § <b>Rabbi Perida raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabbi Ami: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to all the meal offerings</b> that must be brought as <i>matza</i> <b>that they are kneaded with lukewarm</b> water so that the dough will be baked well, as only a small amount of oil is added, <b>and</b> that <b>one must watch over them</b> to ensure <b>that they do not</b> become <b>leavened</b> while kneading and shaping them? Shall <b>we derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the prohibition concerning leavened bread on the festival of <b>Passover, as it is written: “And you shall watch over the <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17), which indicates that one must watch over any dough that is supposed to be made into <i>matza</i>, to ensure that it does not become leavened? |
| Exodus 12:17 | “And you shall guard the matzot ” | Pesachim 38b:1 | <b>“And you shall guard the <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17). This verse teaches that one may use only <b><i>matza</i> that has been guarded</b> from becoming leavened <b>for the purpose</b> of <b>matza,</b> i.e., with the intention of fulfilling one’s obligation of <i>matza</i> with it. This explanation <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, which was prepared for a nazirite or a thanks-offering and <b>which was not guarded for the purpose</b> of <b><i>matza</i> but for the purpose of a sacrifice.</b> |
| Exodus 12:17 | as it is stated: “And you shall guard the matzot ” | Pesachim 40a:14 | <b>Rava</b> reconsidered and <b>then said:</b> It is not only permitted to soak the grains; it is actually <b>a mitzva to soak</b> them, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall guard the <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17). The Gemara explains this statement: <b>If</b> it is <b>not</b> the case <b>that</b> grain <b>requires soaking, for what</b> purpose is <b>guarding</b> necessary? <b>If</b> you claim that this verse is referring to <b>guarding when kneading,</b> that cannot be the case, as <b>guarding</b> grain <b>while kneading is not</b> considered <b>guarding.</b> If one failed to protect the wheat from becoming leavened up to that point, it is of no use to be careful while kneading it. Consequently, this mitzva to guard the dough cannot be referring to the kneading stage. |
| Exodus 12:18 | until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening” | Arakhin 18b:2 | Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall eat unleavened bread, <b>until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening”</b> (Exodus 12:18). This proves that the seventh day of the Festival is included. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is not necessary</b> to cite this verse, as the prohibition against consuming leaven is from the <b>first</b> day of Passover, <b>and</b> the <b>first</b> day <b>is included;</b> and the ban continues until the <b>seventh</b> day, <b>and</b> the <b>seventh</b> day <b>is included.</b> Accordingly, with regard to valuations, even without a verbal analogy Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should maintain that the twentieth year is included in the preceding period. |
| Exodus 12:18 | in the evening, you shall eat matzot ” | Pesachim 120a:7 | The Gemara asks: But if so, the same reasoning should apply to <b><i>matza</i> as well,</b> as <b>it is written: “With <i>matzot</i> and bitter herbs.”</b> The mitzva of <i>matza</i> should also depend on the obligation of the Paschal lamb. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>The verse repeats</b> the obligation to eat <b><i>matza</i>,</b> as it states: “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month <b>in the evening, you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:18). This verse establishes a separate obligation to eat <i>matza</i>, unrelated to the Paschal lamb. <b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Nowadays, <b>both this,</b> the mitzva to eat <i>matza</i>, <b>and that,</b> the mitzva to eat bitter herbs, apply <b>by rabbinic</b> law, as the Torah obligation to eat these foods is in effect only when the Paschal lamb is sacrificed. |
| Exodus 12:18 | in the evening, you shall eat | Pesachim 28b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon, from where does he</b> derive the need <b>to establish it as an obligation</b> even after the destruction of the Temple? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the following verse: “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month <b>in the evening, you shall eat</b> <i>matzot</i>, until the twenty-first day in the evening” (Exodus 12:18). This verse connects the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> to the date of Passover and not only to the Paschal lamb. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> what does he derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: He <b>requires it</b> to teach that there remains an obligation <b>for one who is</b> ritually <b>impure or on a distant journey</b> and cannot bring the Paschal lamb. <b>It could enter your mind to say that since he will not eat the Paschal lamb, he is also not</b> obligated <b>to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that he is obligated to eat them. |
| Exodus 12:18 | in the evening you shall eat matzot ” | Pesachim 5a:3 | <b>And</b> the prohibition against <b>the eating of leavened bread</b> is juxtaposed <b>to the eating of <i>matza</i>,</b> as both appear in the same verse, <b>as it is written: “You shall not eat anything that is leavened; in all of your dwellings you shall eat <i>matzot</i>, etc.”</b> (Exodus 12:20), <b>and it is written with regard to <i>matza</i>:</b> “On the first day, on the fourteenth day <b>in the evening you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:18). Since the <i>halakha</i> that leaven is prohibited on the first night of Passover is derived from this source, there is no need for an additional derivation. |
| Exodus 12:18 | is called: First, as it is stated: “On harishon , on the fourteenth day of the month” | Pesachim 5a:6 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: We found</b> that the <b>fourteenth</b> day <b>is called: First, as it is stated: “On <i>harishon</i>, on the fourteenth day of the month”</b> (Exodus 12:18). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is evident from the verse itself that it is referring to the removal of leaven on the fourteenth, <b>as <i>rishon</i> means previous.</b> In this context, first means the day that precedes the others, i.e., the day before the Festival begins, <b>as the verse stated: “Are you first [<i>rishon</i>] man born?</b> Or were you brought forth before the hills?” (Job 15:7). Based on the parallelism between the two parts of the verse, the word <i>rishon</i> here means before; the one preceding all others. |
| Exodus 12:18 | until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening” | Rosh Hashanah20b:10 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is derived from the verse that states: “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, <b>until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening”</b> (Exodus 12:18). This teaches that the Festival terminates at the end of the day, and a new day begins in the evening. |
| Exodus 12:18 | the verse says: “In the evening you shall eat matzot ” | Sukkah 27a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>from where do we</b> derive that there is an obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse says: “In the evening you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:18). <b>The verse established it</b> as <b>an obligation.</b> |
| Exodus 12:19 | As Rabbi Zeira said, | Beitzah 7b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Shammai, don’t they hold</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Zeira’s</b> opinion? <b>As Rabbi Zeira said,</b> the verse states: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel” (Exodus 12:19). <b>The verse begins with leaven and ends with leavened bread to say to you</b> that <b>leaven is equivalent to leavened bread.</b> How, then, can Beit Shammai maintain that the two are prohibited by different measures? |
| Exodus 12:19 | leaven that the Merciful One wrote | Beitzah 7b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the measures are equal, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only the prohibition of <b>leavened bread, and it would not be necessary</b> to write <b>leaven, and I would say</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>leavened bread, whose leavening is not</b> as <b>extensive,</b> is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> then <b>leaven, whose leavening is extensive, all the more so</b> should the measure that determines liability be an olive-bulk. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the explicit reference to <b>leaven that the Merciful One wrote</b> in the verse: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19)? It must be <b>to tell you</b> that <b>the measure of this,</b> leavened bread, <b>is not equal to the measure of that,</b> leaven. Rather, the measure that determines liability for leaven is smaller. |
| Exodus 12:19 | “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” | Pesachim 10b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one must conduct a search three times? The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna who both say:</b> The requirement to conduct three searches <b>corresponds to</b> the <b>three</b> times that <b>the removal</b> of leaven <b>is</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> One verse says: “<i>Matzot</i> shall be eaten for seven days, and <b>no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: <b>“Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), while a third verse says: “Seven days shall you eat <i>matzot</i>, <b>yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15). |
| Exodus 12:19 | shall be cut off | Pesachim 43a:21 | The Gemara challenges this derivation: <b>If so,</b> if the expression: Anything leavened, includes leaven in a mixture, <b>let one also be liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for eating leaven in a mixture. <b>As it is written:</b> “Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; <b>for whosoever eats anything [<i>kol</i>] leavened,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from the people of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or one born in the land” (Exodus 12:19). Apparently, one is punished with <i>karet</i> for eating anything that contains leaven. |
| Exodus 12:19 | “Seven days, leaven shall not be found in your houses” | Pesachim 4b:9 | <b>Abaye said: Two verses are written,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is derived by comparing them. <b>It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Seven days, leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), indicating that throughout these seven days it is prohibited to maintain leaven in one’s house. <b>And it is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15), indicating that one must remove the leaven on the first day, after the Festival has begun. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> apparent contradiction be resolved? The Gemara responds: The latter verse comes <b>to include the fourteenth</b> day of Nisan with regard <b>to the elimination</b> of leaven. The phrase: On the first day, does not refer to the fifteenth of Nisan or to the beginning of the festival of Passover. It is referring to the fourteenth, the day on which the Paschal lamb is slaughtered. |
| Exodus 12:19 | shall be cut off | Pesachim 5a:2 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>The removal of leaven</b> is juxtaposed <b>to the eating of leavened bread,</b> as they appear in the same verse, <b>as it is written: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses, as anyone who eats that which is leavened,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from the congregation of Israel” (Exodus 12:19). |
| Exodus 12:19 | “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses” | Pesachim 5b:2 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19). To <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state</b> this prohibition? <b>Wasn’t it already stated:</b> “And <b>no leaven shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leavened bread seen with you, in all your borders”</b> (Exodus 13:7)? |
| Exodus 12:19 | as it is stated: “It shall not be found” | Pesachim 6a:6 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gentile who enters the courtyard of a Jew with his dough in his hand,</b> the Jew <b>need not remove</b> the leaven by evicting the gentile from his property. However, if the gentile <b>deposited</b> the leaven <b>with him,</b> and the Jew accepted responsibility, <b>he must remove</b> it. If <b>he designated</b> a room in his <b>house for</b> the gentile to place his leavened food, <b>he need not remove</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “It shall not be found”</b> (Exodus 12:19). |
| Exodus 12:19 | it is written here: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses” | Pesachim 7b:14 | The Gemara cites the relevant verses included in the above derivation. <b>Finding</b> in one context is derived <b>from finding</b> in another context by verbal analogy, as <b>it is written here: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it is written there: “And he searched, starting with the eldest, and ending with the youngest; and</b> the goblet <b>was found</b> in Benjamin’s sack” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And</b> the word <b>finding</b> in this verse is connected <b>to searching in that same</b> verse by juxtaposition, as the verse says: “And he searched... and was found.” |
| Exodus 12:19 | matter, as it is stated: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses” | Pesachim 8a:1 | <b>because the light of a lamp is effective for searching. And even though there is no proof for</b> this <b>matter, there is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter, as it is stated: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it says: “And he searched, starting with the eldest,</b> and ending with the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s sack…” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And it says: “At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps”</b> (Zephaniah 1:12), <b>and it says: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts”</b> (Proverbs 20:27). |
| Exodus 12:20 | dwelling, which the Merciful One writes with regard to matza and bitter herbs, | Kiddushin 37b:12 | Additionally, the Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>dwelling, which the Merciful One writes with regard to <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs,</b> in the verse: “In all your dwellings you shall eat <i>matza</i>” (Exodus 12:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to state this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “They shall eat</b> the Paschal offering <b>with <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs”</b> (Numbers 9:11), <b>when there is a Paschal offering, yes,</b> one must eat it with <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs, but <b>when there is no Paschal offering,</b> i.e., when the Temple is not standing, there is <b>no</b> obligation to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that these mitzvot apply every Passover, whether or not the Temple is standing. |
| Exodus 12:20 | kol | Nazir 36a:1 | <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Permitted and forbidden substances combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against offering leaven</b> on the altar, <b>as well,</b> as it states: “For any [<i>kol</i>] leaven and any [<i>kol</i>] honey shall not be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ze’eiri issue his ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who derives</b> from the term <b><i>kol</i></b> in the verse “You shall eat nothing [<i>kol</i>] leavened” (Exodus 12:20) that a mixture with part leaven is forbidden on Passover. |
| Exodus 12:20 | “And all that which is leavened you shall not eat; | Pesachim 28b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There are three verses</b> that <b>are written</b> with regard to this prohibition, and in Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion each one teaches that the prohibition applies at a different time. One verse states: <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3). Another verse states: <b>“And all that which is leavened you shall not eat;</b> in all your habitations you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). And a third verse states: <b>“You shall eat no leavened bread with it”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread even <b>before its time,</b> on Passover eve. <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread <b>after its time</b> as well, if a Jew owned it during Passover. <b>And one verse</b> indicates that the prohibition applies <b>during Passover</b> itself. |
| Exodus 12:20 | the verse states: “In all of your habitations you shall eat matzot ” | Pesachim 36a:18 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one</b> can <b>fulfill his obligation by</b> eating <i>matza</i> prepared from the wheat of <b>first fruits;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “In all of your habitations you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:20). This verse indicates that one fulfills his obligation only with <b><i>matza</i> that</b> may <b>be eaten “in all of your habitations.”</b> This expression <b>excludes first fruits, which</b> may <b>not be eaten in all of your habitations, but</b> only <b>in Jerusalem.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Exodus 12:20 | the verse states: “In all of your habitations you shall eat matzot ” | Pesachim 36b:2 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person</b> can <b>fulfill his obligation with</b> <i>matza</i> from <b>first fruit;</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “In all of your habitations you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:20). The verse indicates that one can fulfill his obligation with <b><i>matza</i> that</b> may <b>be eaten in all habitations.</b> It <b>excludes first fruits, which</b> may <b>not be eaten in all habitations, but only in Jerusalem.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I</b> should <b>also exclude second-tithe</b> produce as fit for <i>matza</i>; therefore <b>the verse states: “<i>Matzot</i>,” “<i>matzot</i>.”</b> As stated above, this repetition serves to <b>amplify,</b> and it includes second tithe in the materials that may be used in the preparation of <i>matza</i>. |
| Exodus 12:20 | “You shall eat nothing leavened; | Pesachim 43a:18 | The Gemara notes that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion: <b>“You shall eat nothing leavened;</b> in all your dwellings you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). The Sages taught: This verse comes <b>to include Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>, Median beer, Edomite vinegar, and Egyptian <i>zitom</i>.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one who eats any of these items <b>will be punishable</b> by <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For whoever eats leavened bread…</b>that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from Israel” (Exodus 12:15), from which the Sages derived: <b>For</b> eating <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread</b> one is <b>punished</b> with <b><i>karet</i>, but for</b> eating <b>its mixture</b> one is only in violation <b>of a prohibition.</b> |
| Exodus 12:20 | as it is written: “You shall not eat anything that is leavened; in all of your dwellings you shall eat matzot , etc.” | Pesachim 5a:3 | <b>And</b> the prohibition against <b>the eating of leavened bread</b> is juxtaposed <b>to the eating of <i>matza</i>,</b> as both appear in the same verse, <b>as it is written: “You shall not eat anything that is leavened; in all of your dwellings you shall eat <i>matzot</i>, etc.”</b> (Exodus 12:20), <b>and it is written with regard to <i>matza</i>:</b> “On the first day, on the fourteenth day <b>in the evening you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:18). Since the <i>halakha</i> that leaven is prohibited on the first night of Passover is derived from this source, there is no need for an additional derivation. |
| Exodus 12:22 | “And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning” | Bava Kamma60a:17 | <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the plague of the firstborn: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:22)? If the plague was not decreed upon the Jewish people, why were they not permitted to leave their homes? <b>Once permission</b> is granted <b>to the destroyer</b> to kill, <b>it does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. And not only</b> that, <b>but it begins with the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked”</b> (Ezekiel 21:8), where mention of the righteous precedes the wicked. |
| Exodus 12:22 | “And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning” | Bava Kamma60b:1 | <b>A person</b> should <b>always enter</b> an unfamiliar city <b>at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> i.e., while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “It is good” with regard to the creation of light (see Genesis 1:4). This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he</b> should <b>leave at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> meaning after sunrise the next morning, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:22). |
| Exodus 12:22 | the bundle of hyssop. | Menachot 27a:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: By means of a verbal analogy, he <b>derives</b> the term <b>taking,</b> written with regard to the four species, <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop.</b> It is written there, in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal offering in Egypt: “Take a bundle of hyssop” (Exodus 12:22), and it is written here, with regard to the four species: “And you shall take for you on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). |
| Exodus 12:22 | the lintel and the two doorposts” | Menachot 34a:10 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary.</b> Rather, <b>when</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And strike <b>the lintel and the two doorposts”</b> (Exodus 12:22), one can claim that there is a superfluous word in this verse, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “two,”</b> since the minimum of doorposts is two. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “two”? This established a paradigm</b> that <b>anywhere where it is stated “doorposts,”</b> it means <b>only one</b> doorpost, <b>unless the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to <b>two</b> doorposts. |
| Exodus 12:22 | “Take a bundle of hyssop” | Sukkah 11b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> From where does he derive this requirement by Torah law? The Gemara answers: By means of a verbal analogy, <b>he derives</b> the term <b>taking,</b> written with regard to the four species, <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop.

| Exodus 12:22 | “Take a bundle of hyssop” | Sukkah 33a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> From where does he derive this requirement by Torah law? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to the four species <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> in the context of the four species: <b>“And you shall take for yourselves on the first day</b> the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm and boughs of a dense-leaved tree, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40). <b>and it is written there,</b> in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb in Egypt: <b>“Take a bundle of hyssop”</b> (Exodus 12:22), <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the mitzva to take the hyssop is specifically <b>in a bundle, so too here,</b> the mitzva to take the four species is specifically <b>in a bundle.

| Exodus 12:27 | because the Omnipresent passed over [ pasaḥ ] the houses of our forefathers in Egypt, as it is stated: “That you shall say: It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Paschal offering for He passed over | Pesachim 116b:1 | <b>these three matters on Passover has not fulfilled his obligation:</b> The <b>Paschal lamb, <i>matza</i>, and bitter herbs.</b> When one mentions these matters, he must elaborate and explain them: The <b>Paschal lamb</b> is brought <b>because the Omnipresent passed over [<i>pasaḥ</i>] the houses of our forefathers in Egypt, as it is stated: “That you shall say: It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Paschal offering for He passed over</b> the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses” (Exodus 12:27). |
| Exodus 12:27 | as the verse said: “And you shall say: It is a Passover sacrifice | Pesachim 62b:6 | <b>Rav Pappa said: It is different there</b> in the case of another sacrifice slaughtered for the purpose of a Paschal lamb, <b>as the verse said: “And you shall say: It is a Passover sacrifice</b> to the Lord, Who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote Egypt, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and prostrated themselves” (Exodus 12:27). The word <b>“it”</b> indicates that the Paschal lamb must be brought <b>as it is,</b> according to its details, without any change. <b>It,</b> the Paschal lamb, must <b>not</b> be offered <b>for the purpose of other</b> sacrifices; <b>and other</b> sacrifices must <b>not</b> be offered <b>for its purpose,</b> i.e., as a Paschal lamb. In both of these cases, the offering is disqualified. |
| Exodus 12:27 | “it” is stated concerning slaughter [ zeviḥa ], | Zevachim 10b:2 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer then presented a different logical inference: With regard to a sin offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter,</b> in the verse: “And slaughter it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit. And</b> similarly, <b>with regard to a Paschal offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>],</b> in the verse: “It is the sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27). Here, the word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Exodus 12:27 | the verse states | Zevachim 37b:7 | With regard to the <b>Paschal offering,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is not derived through a verbal analogy, but rather this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written concerning it.</b> The verse referring to peace offerings states: “If he offers a lamb for his offering” (Leviticus 3:7). The Torah could simply have stated: <b>A lamb,</b> and proceed from there to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of a lamb peace offering. If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> he offers <b>a lamb”?</b> This serves <b>to include the substitute of a Paschal offering</b> that was substituted <b>after</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering,</b> teaching <b>that it is sacrificed as a peace offering,</b> since the Paschal offering has the status of a peace offering after that time. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even before</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering the same</b> should apply, i.e., that the substitute of a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27), which indicates that <b>it,</b> the Paschal offering itself, is sacrificed, but its substitute is not sacrificed. |
| Exodus 12:27 | Passover” | Zevachim 7b:13 | The Gemara answers that this is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And you shall say: It is the sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of</b> the Lord’s <b>Passover”</b> (Exodus 12:27), which indicates <b>that</b> the <b>slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of</b> the <b>Paschal offering. If</b> the verse <b>is not</b> necessary in order <b>to</b> derive <b>the matter</b> of <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering,</b> as that <i>halakha</i> is derived from Deuteronomy 16:1, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> |
| Exodus 12:27 | Passover” | Zevachim 7b:17 | <b>Rather, Rav Safra says</b> that the verses should be expounded as follows: The verse <b>“And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering”</b> teaches the statement <b>of Rav Naḥman,</b> that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. The verse: <b>“Observe the month of the spring</b> and offer the Paschal offering” (Deuteronomy 16:1), teaches that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to sacrifice the Paschal offering without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering.</b> The verse: <b>“And you shall say:</b> It is <b>the sacrifice of</b> the Lord’s <b>Passover”</b> (Exodus 12:27), teaches that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to slaughter it without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> The term <b>“it is”</b> in the latter verse teaches that <b>both here and there,</b> i.e., with regard to both the offering and the owner, proper intent is <b>indispensable.</b> |
| Exodus 12:29 | north wind did not blow at midnight, as it is stated: “And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the firstborn | Yevamot 72a:4 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those forty years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness there was not a day in which</b> the <b>north wind did not blow at midnight, as it is stated: “And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the firstborn</b> in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:29). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> How is it derived from this verse that speaks of the exodus from Egypt that a north wind blew at midnight during the forty years that the Jewish people wandered in the wilderness? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us that a time of favor is a</b> significant <b>matter.</b> Since midnight had once been a time of divine favor at the beginning of the exodus from Egypt, it continued to be a time of favor throughout the forty years that the Jewish people sojourned in the wilderness. |
| Exodus 12:36 | and they gave them what they requested | Berakhot 9b:3 | With regard to the spoils taken from Egypt described in the verse: “And the Lord gave the nation grace in the eyes of Egypt, <b>and they gave them what they requested</b> and they emptied Egypt” (Exodus 12:36), <b>Rabbi Ami said: This teaches that</b> the Egyptians <b>gave them what they requested against their will.</b> There is a dispute with regard to the question: Against whose will? <b>Some say</b> it was given <b>against the will of the Egyptians, and some say</b> it was given <b>against the will of Israel.</b> The proponent of each position cites support for his opinion. |
| Exodus 12:36 | with them, as it is stated: “They despoiled [ vayenatzlu ] Egypt” | Pesachim 119a:7 | <b>And when the Jewish people ascended from Egypt they took</b> this treasure <b>with them, as it is stated: “They despoiled [<i>vayenatzlu</i>] Egypt”</b> (Exodus 12:36). The Sages explain this term. <b>Rav Asi said: They made</b> Egypt <b>like this trap [<i>metzuda</i>]</b> for birds, where grain is usually placed as bait, <b>in which there is no grain. Rabbi Shimon said:</b> They made Egypt <b>like the depths [<i>kimetzula</i>]</b> of the sea <b>in which there are no fish.</b> |
| Exodus 12:36 | “And the Lord gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt, and they lent them” | Sanhedrin 91a:10 | The Gemara relates: On <b>another occasion, the people of Egypt came to judgment with the Jewish people before Alexander of Macedon.</b> The Egyptian people <b>said to</b> Alexander: <b>It says</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the Lord gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt, and they lent them”</b> (Exodus 12:36). <b>Give us the silver and gold that you took from us;</b> you claimed that you were borrowing it and you never returned it. |
| Exodus 12:39 | because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “And they baked the dough that they took out of Egypt | Pesachim 116b:2 | Rabban Gamliel continues to explain: The reason for <b><i>matza</i></b> is <b>because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “And they baked the dough that they took out of Egypt</b> as cakes of <i>matzot</i>, for it was not leavened, as they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual” (Exodus 12:39). The reason for <b>bitter herbs</b> is <b>because the Egyptians embittered our forefathers’ lives in Egypt, as it is stated: “And they embittered their lives</b> with hard service, in mortar and in brick; in all manner of service in the field, all the service that they made them serve was with rigor” (Exodus 1:14). |
| Exodus 12:40 | said to them: I too will cite proof to you only from the Torah, as it is stated: “And the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years” | Sanhedrin 91a:12 | Geviha ben Pesisa <b>said to them: From where are you citing proof</b> that you are entitled to the silver and gold? <b>They said to him: From the Torah.</b> Geviha ben Pesisa <b>said to them: I too will cite proof to you only from the Torah, as it is stated: “And the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years”</b> (Exodus 12:40), during which they were enslaved to Egypt, engaged in hard manual labor. <b>Give us the wages for the work</b> performed <b>by</b> the <b>600,000</b> men above the age of twenty (see Exodus 12:37) <b>whom you enslaved in Egypt</b> for <b>four hundred and thirty years.</b> |
| Exodus 12:42 | the verse said: “It was a night of watching | Pesachim 109b:5 | <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse said: “It was a night of watching</b> to the Lord” (Exodus 12:42), which indicates that Passover night <b>is a night that remains guarded from</b> demons and <b>harmful spirits</b> of all kinds. Therefore, there is no cause for concern about this form of danger on this particular night. |
| Exodus 12:42 | The verse states: “It is a night of watching | Rosh Hashanah11b:4 | It was also taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: In Nisan</b> our forefathers <b>were redeemed</b> from Egypt; <b>and in Nisan in the future</b> the Jewish people <b>will be redeemed</b> in the final redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the final redemption will be in Nisan? <b>The verse states: “It is a night of watching</b> for the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; this is the Lord’s night of watching, for all the children of Israel throughout their generations” (Exodus 12:42). This teaches that the night of Passover is <b>a night that has been continuously watched,</b> i.e., set aside for the purpose of redemption, <b>from the six days of Creation,</b> and it will continue to be so until the final redemption. |
| Exodus 12:43 | no foreigner may eat of it” | Pesachim 3b:10 | With regard to the investigation of the priestly lineage, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain gentile would ascend</b> on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, claiming he was Jewish, <b>and eat Paschal</b> lambs <b>in Jerusalem.</b> He would then return home and boast about how he had tricked the Jews. <b>He said: It is written:</b> “This is the statute of the Paschal lamb; <b>no foreigner may eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), and another verse says: <b>“Any uncircumcised man shall not eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:48). <b>And</b> yet, <b>I ate from the finest of the fine</b> portions of the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:43 | “No stranger shall eat from it” | Pesachim 96a:17 | The Gemara continues to question: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> when the verse states: <b>“No stranger shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), <b>so too,</b> should it be inferred that it is only <b>from it,</b> the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, <b>that he</b> may <b>not eat, but he</b> may <b>eat</b> from <b>the Paschal lamb</b> sacrificed in later <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt apply to future generations as well. Consequently, anyone who was prohibited from eating the Paschal lamb in Egypt may not eat it in subsequent years either. |
| Exodus 12:43 | no alien shall eat of it” | Shabbat 87a:5 | And <b>he broke the tablets</b> following the sin of the Golden Calf. <b>What</b> source <b>did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? Moses <b>said: With</b> regard to the <b>Paschal</b> lamb, <b>which is</b> only <b>one of six hundred and thirteen mitzvot, the Torah stated:</b> “And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance of the Paschal offering; <b>no alien shall eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), referring not only to gentiles, but to apostate Jews as well. Regarding the tablets, which represented <b>the entire Torah, and Israel</b> at that moment were <b>apostates,</b> as they were worshipping the calf, <b>all the more so</b> are they not worthy of receiving the Torah. <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, agreed with his</b> reasoning? <b>As it is stated:</b> “The first tablets <b>which you broke [<i>asher shibarta</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:1), <b>and Reish Lakish said:</b> The word <i>asher</i> is an allusion to the phrase: <b>May your strength be true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i></b>] <b>due to the fact that you broke</b> the tablets. |
| Exodus 12:43 | one of 613 mitzvot, the Torah states: “No alien shall eat of it” | Yevamot 62a:3 | Moses <b>broke the tablets</b> following the sin of the Golden Calf. <b>What did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? Moses <b>said: If</b> in the case of the <b>Paschal lamb, which is</b> only <b>one of 613 mitzvot, the Torah states: “No alien shall eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), excluding not only gentiles but apostate Jews as well, then here, in the case of the Golden Calf, where the tablets represent <b>the entire Torah and</b> where <b>the Jewish people</b> are <b>apostates,</b> as they are worshipping the calf, <b>all the more so</b> must they be excluded from receiving them. |
| Exodus 12:43 | “No stranger shall eat from it” | Yevamot 70b:14 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>Now that you have said</b> that the phrase <b>“from it”</b> used in this context <b>comes for an exposition</b> and serves to exclude other cases, with regard to the phrase “from it” in the verse <b>“No stranger shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), <b>why do I</b> need it? The Gemara answers: This, too, teaches that it is only <b>from it,</b> eating the Paschal lamb, |
| Exodus 12:44 | which is stated: “But every slave man that is bought for money” | Gittin 38a:12 | The Gemara comments: In this matter, <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel says:</b> With regard to one <b>who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated, and he does not</b> even <b>require a bill of manumission.</b> Shmuel cited a proof from that <b>which is stated: “But every slave man that is bought for money”</b> (Exodus 12:44). Does this apply only to <b>a slave</b> who is <b>a man, and not to a woman slave? Rather,</b> it means: The slave of a man, i.e., <b>a slave whose master has authority</b> and control <b>over him, is called a slave,</b> since he is the slave of a particular man. However, with regard to a slave <b>whose master does not have authority over him,</b> such as one who has been declared ownerless, he <b>is not called a slave</b> but a freeman. Therefore, once Shmuel despaired of retrieving his maidservant, she was no longer under his control and did not require a bill of manumission. |
| Exodus 12:44 | every slave man that is bought for money” | Kiddushin 72b:9 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> it was <b>for good, and</b> there is no contradiction, since <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> With regard to one <b>who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated and he does not</b> even <b>require a bill of manumission.</b> Shmuel cited a proof from that <b>which is stated:</b> “But <b>every slave man that is bought for money”</b> (Exodus 12:44). Does this apply only to <b>a slave</b> who is <b>a man, and not to a woman slave? Rather,</b> it means: The slave of a man, i.e., <b>a slave whose master has authority</b> and control <b>over him, is called a slave,</b> since he is the slave of a particular man. <b>A slave whose master does not have authority over him,</b> such as one who has been declared ownerless, <b>is not called a slave</b> but a freeman. The slaves who went to Mishon no longer had the status of slaves because their masters remained behind. |
| Exodus 12:44 | “When you have circumcised him, then shall he eat from it” | Pesachim 96a:21 | The Gemara continues its line of questioning: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> when the verse said: <b>“When you have circumcised him, then shall he eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:44), <b>so too,</b> should it be inferred <b>that from it,</b> the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, <b>he</b> may <b>not eat</b> unless he first circumcises his sons and slaves, <b>but he</b> may <b>eat from the Paschal lamb</b> sacrificed in later <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform,”</b> which teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies to later generations as well. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the qualifying term <b>“from it”?</b> The Gemara answers that this term teaches that <b>from it,</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>the</b> lack of <b>circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>and slaves prevents</b> a father or master from eating until he ensures that all of the male members of his household have been circumcised, <b>but the circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>and slaves does not prevent</b> him <b>from</b> eating <b><i>teruma</i></b> if he is himself eligible to eat it. |
| Exodus 12:44 | “Every slave of a man that is bought for money, | Yevamot 48a:2 | <b>Rava said: What is the rationale</b> for <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>“Every slave of a man that is bought for money,</b> when you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it” (Exodus 12:44). Could the use of the phrase “slave of a man,” rather than just: Slave, possibly indicate that the verse applies only to <b>a man’s slave but not a woman’s slave?</b> Certainly not; <b>rather,</b> the phrase “slave of a man” means that the slave himself is a man, i.e., an adult, and teaches that <b>a slave who is a man you may circumcise against his will,</b> and there is no need for him to accept upon himself the yoke of mitzvot, <b>but you may not circumcise</b> a gentile’s <b>son who is a man,</b> i.e., an adult who is not a slave, <b>against his will.</b> |
| Exodus 12:44 | “When you have circumcised him, then he shall eat from it” | Yevamot 70b:10 | The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>“When you have circumcised him, then he shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:44). The words “from it” teach that <b>the</b> lack of <b>circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>and slaves prevents one from eating the Paschal lamb,</b> but <b>the</b> lack of <b>circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>and slaves does not prevent one from</b> eating <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> if he himself is eligible to eat it. |
| Exodus 12:44 | one’s slaves at the time of the eating | Yevamot 71a:16 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>at the time of the preparation,</b> i.e., the slaughter, of the Paschal lamb, as it is stated: “Let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it” (Exodus 12:48), <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the circumcision of <b>one’s slaves at the time of the eating</b> of the Paschal lamb, as it is stated: “But every man’s servant…when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat from it” (Exodus 12:44). <b>From where</b> do I derive that it is proper <b>to apply</b> the prohibition <b>that was stated about this</b> case <b>to that</b> case, <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>that was said about that</b> case <b>to this</b> case, i.e., that the circumcision of both one’s male children and one’s slaves is indispensable both at the time of the preparation of the Paschal lamb and at the time of its consumption? The <i>tanna</i> answers that <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“then”</b> with regard to male children and the term <b>“then”</b> with regard to slaves <b>as a verbal analogy.</b> |
| Exodus 12:45 | “A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat from it” | Pesachim 96a:20 | The Gemara continues to question its initial derivation: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> when the verse pertaining to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt states: <b>“A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:45), <b>so too,</b> should it be derived that <b>from it,</b> the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, <b>he</b> may <b>not eat, but he</b> may <b>eat from the Paschal lamb</b> sacrificed in later <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “And you shall perform,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb in later generations are the same as the <i>halakhot</i> that applied in Egypt. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the qualifying term <b>“from it”?</b> The Gemara answers that it teaches that <b>from it,</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>apostasy disqualifies</b> one from partaking, <b>but apostasy does not disqualify</b> one from eating <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 12:45 | may not partake of teruma ? It is stated: “A sojourner and a hired servant | Yevamot 70a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an uncircumcised</b> priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i>? It is stated: “A sojourner and a hired servant</b> shall not eat thereof” (Exodus 12:45) <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb, and it is stated: “A sojourner</b> of a priest <b>and a hired servant</b> shall not eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10) <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>. Just as “a sojourner and a hired servant” stated with regard to the Paschal lamb</b> indicates that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited</b> from eating <b>it, so too, “a sojourner and a hired servant” stated with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> teaches that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited</b> from eating <b>it.</b> |
| Exodus 12:46 | the breaking of a bone in the Paschal offering, as the Merciful One states: “Nor shall you break a bone thereof” | Chullin 11a:8 | <b>Mar, son of Ravina, said:</b> The fact that we follow a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the breaking of a bone in the Paschal offering, as the Merciful One states: “Nor shall you break a bone thereof”</b> (Exodus 12:46). Mar, son of Ravina, suggested: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the brain membrane was perforated</b> and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, as it is impossible to examine its brain membrane since one may not break its bones. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>? |
| Exodus 12:46 | The deficiency of a bone in the Paschal offering, | Chullin 17b:13 | § <b>Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that <b>there are three deficiencies</b> with the same measure, as follows: <b>The deficiency of a bone in the Paschal offering,</b> with regard to which it is written: “Neither shall you break a bone therein” (Exodus 12:46); <b>the deficiency of an ear in a firstborn</b> animal that renders it blemished and unfit for sacrifice, in which case a priest may slaughter it anywhere and eat it; and <b>the deficiency</b> that constitutes <b>a blemish in</b> other forms of <b>sacrificial</b> animals. |
| Exodus 12:46 | breaking a bone, | Pesachim 70a:12 | Yet another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Teima, is</b> the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth <b>subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone,</b> as is the Paschal lamb, with regard to which the Torah explicitly states: “And you shall not break a bone in it” (Exodus 12:46), <b>or is it not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone?</b> The possible considerations are as follows: Do we say that <b>even though the Merciful One compares</b> the Festival peace-offering <b>to the Paschal lamb, the verse</b> that teaches the prohibition against breaking a bone <b>says “in it,”</b> and these words serve as a qualifying statement, indicating that the prohibition applies only <b>in it,</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>and not in the Festival peace-offering</b> that comes with it? <b>Or perhaps this</b> term, <b>“in it,”</b> teaches that the prohibition applies only <b>to a fit</b> Paschal lamb <b>but not to a disqualified</b> one. |
| Exodus 12:46 | in it” | Pesachim 83a:8 | <b>Say</b> in refutation of this proof: <b>No. Actually, I could say to you that serving</b> as a base for <b>leftover is nothing</b> significant, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that the prohibition stated in the Torah: “And you shall not break a bone <b>in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46), applies <b>even to a disqualified</b> Paschal lamb. The prohibition to break the bones of the Paschal lamb applies even when the Paschal lamb itself may no longer be eaten. Thus, the bones must be burned because there is no way to extract the marrow. They are not burned because they themselves have served as a base for the leftover marrow. |
| Exodus 12:46 | and you shall not break a bone in it” | Pesachim 84a:14 | <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason. Rather,</b> it is <b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The transgression is simply the failure to consume all the meat during the allotted time rather than the performance of an action. <b>And one is not flogged for</b> any prohibition that does not involve an action<b>. But</b> with regard to <b>one who breaks</b> the bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal lamb, <b>from where do we</b> derive that he, too, does not receive lashes? The Gemara answers that the source is <b>as the verse states:</b> “In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not remove any of the meat from the house to the outside, <b>and you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). It may be inferred that the prohibition applies <b>“in it,” in a valid</b> Paschal lamb, <b>and not in a disqualified</b> one. |
| Exodus 12:46 | “In one house shall it be eaten…and you shall not break a bone in it” | Pesachim 84b:14 | The Gemara points out that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with four of</b> the interpretations cited above. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse <b>“In one house shall it be eaten…and you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46) teaches that <b>one is liable for</b> breaking the bone of <b>a valid</b> Paschal lamb, <b>and one is not liable for</b> breaking the bone of a <b>disqualified</b> Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:46 | “And you shall not break a bone in it” | Pesachim 85a:2 | <b>And</b> as a proof, the Gemara cites that which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). This prohibition includes <b>both a bone in which there is marrow and a bone in which there is no marrow. How do I establish</b> the positive mitzva expressed in the verse: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8)? It is to be fulfilled exclusively <b>with meat that is on the bone.</b> |
| Exodus 12:46 | you shall not carry out any of the meat from the house to the outside” | Pesachim 85b:1 | <b>from</b> the location of its <b>group to</b> the location of another <b>group, from where</b> is it derived that he has violated a prohibition? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “In one house shall it be eaten; <b>you shall not carry out any of the meat from the house to the outside”</b> (Exodus 12:46), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited to remove meat <b>from house to house; from where</b> do I derive that it is prohibited even to transfer the meat <b>from group to group</b> within one house? <b>The verse states: To the outside,</b> which includes any case in which one brings the meat <b>outside of</b> the place where <b>it may be eaten.</b> |
| Exodus 12:46 | places; therefore, the Torah states: “In one house shall it be eaten [ ye’akhel ]” | Pesachim 86a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: I<b>t is Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Upon the houses wherein they shall eat it”</b> (Exodus 12:7). This <b>teaches that</b> one <b>Paschal lamb may be eaten in two</b> separate <b>groups,</b> even if the groups eat it in separate houses. I <b>might</b> have thought that one person <b>who eats</b> from it <b>may eat</b> it <b>in two</b> separate <b>places; therefore, the Torah states: “In one house shall it be eaten [<i>ye’akhel</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:46). |
| Exodus 12:46 | as it is written: “Nor shall you break a bone in it” | Shevuot 3b:11 | First, the Gemara explains how this mishna demonstrates Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Granted</b> that <b>breaking</b> a bone <b>of an impure</b> Paschal offering does not incur lashes, <b>as it is written: “Nor shall you break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). The term “in it” indicates that the verse refers only <b>to a valid</b> Paschal offering, <b>but not to a disqualified</b> one, such as one that is impure. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a pure</b> Paschal offering, <b>what is the reason</b> he is not flogged? <b>Is it not because it is</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged?</b> |
| Exodus 12:46 | “Nor shall you break a bone of it” | Zevachim 97b:5 | Rav’s opinion relates to that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>As it is stated</b> in a verse concerning the Paschal offering: <b>“Nor shall you break a bone of it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: Both a bone that contains marrow and a bone that does not contain marrow</b> are included in the prohibition. This statement is analyzed: If one means to break a bone in order to eat its marrow, <b>why</b> would that be prohibited? <b>Should</b> not the <b>positive mitzva</b> of eating the edible parts of the offering, including the marrow, <b>come and override</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of not breaking a bone of the Paschal offering? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition that</b> relates <b>to the Temple.</b> |
| Exodus 12:48 | be circumcised” | Avodah Zarah27a:6 | § It was stated that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda circumcision must be performed for the sake of fulfilling a mitzva, whereas Rabbi Yosei holds that no particular intention is necessary. The Gemara analyzes these opinions. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written:</b> “And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover <b>to the Lord let</b> all his males <b>be circumcised”</b> (Exodus 12:48). It can be inferred from the verse that the males must be circumcised “to the Lord,” i.e., for the sake of fulfilling God’s will. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is written: <b>“He must be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13). The usage of the doubled verb teaches that circumcision may be performed by anyone. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “But no uncircumcised man shall eat from it” | Pesachim 120a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rava,</b> who maintains that it is a mitzva from the Torah to eat <i>matza</i> nowadays, how could he respond to that interpretation of the verse? Rava could have <b>said to you:</b> I do <b>not require</b> a special <b>verse</b> to teach that <b>a ritually impure person and a person who was on a distant road</b> are obligated to eat <i>matza</i>. These people are obligated because they <b>are no worse than an uncircumcised</b> man <b>or an alien,</b> i.e., one who does not observe the <i>mitzvot</i>, who are obligated to eat <i>matza</i> despite the fact that they do not sacrifice the Paschal lamb. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“But no uncircumcised man shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:48). <b>“From it”</b> indicates that he may <b>not eat from</b> the Paschal lamb; <b>however, he does eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs.</b> The same is true for anyone else who is prevented from eating the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:48 | as he is no worse than an uncircumcised man or a resident alien. As it is written: “And no uncircumcised man shall eat of it” | Pesachim 28b:12 | <b>And Rabbi Shimon,</b> from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? In his opinion, <b>a verse is not necessary</b> to teach that <b>one who is</b> ritually <b>impure or on a distant journey</b> is obligated to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs, <b>as he is no worse than an uncircumcised man or a resident alien. As it is written: “And no uncircumcised man shall eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:48). The added emphasis in <b>“of it”</b> indicates that only <b>it,</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>he does not eat; however, he</b> must <b>eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> how would he respond? The Gemara answers: Granted, the Torah did not need to add this verse. Nonetheless, <b>it is written in this</b> context that one who is impure or on a distant journey is obligated to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs. <b>And it is written in that</b> context with regard to the uncircumcised man and the resident alien as well. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “Any uncircumcised man shall not eat of it” | Pesachim 3b:10 | With regard to the investigation of the priestly lineage, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain gentile would ascend</b> on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, claiming he was Jewish, <b>and eat Paschal</b> lambs <b>in Jerusalem.</b> He would then return home and boast about how he had tricked the Jews. <b>He said: It is written:</b> “This is the statute of the Paschal lamb; <b>no foreigner may eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), and another verse says: <b>“Any uncircumcised man shall not eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:48). <b>And</b> yet, <b>I ate from the finest of the fine</b> portions of the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “and all uncircumcised males,” | Pesachim 61b:6 | In order to resolve this issue, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> as it says: “And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance of the Passover: No stranger shall eat of it; but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it” (Exodus 12:43–44). <b>What</b> is implied from the emphasis of <b>“this”? If you say</b> that it comes to teach that if <b>all</b> the members of the group are <b>uncircumcised</b> the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> but if only <b>part of</b> the group is uncircumcised <b>it is not disqualified, this is derived from</b> the words <b>“and all uncircumcised males,”</b> in the verse: “And all uncircumcised males shall not eat of it” (Exodus 12:48). The amplification indicated by the word all teaches that the offering is invalidated only if all members of the group are uncircumcised. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “And no uncircumcised person shall eat from it” | Pesachim 96a:15 | <b>The</b> Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> with regard to that <b>which is written</b> in the context of the Paschal lamb offered in Egypt: <b>“And no uncircumcised person shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:48), <b>so too,</b> should it be inferred that the expression “from it” limits the application of the verse and teaches <b>that “from it,”</b> the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, <b>he</b> may <b>not eat, but he</b> may <b>eat from the Paschal lamb</b> sacrificed in later <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt apply to later generations as well. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “No uncircumcised person shall eat from it” | Yevamot 70b:11 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the words “from it” come to exclude any other case, <b>say</b> a similar exposition with regard to the uncircumcised. As it is stated with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>“No uncircumcised person shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:48), indicating that <b>“from it,”</b> the Paschal lamb, an uncircumcised man <b>may not eat, but he may eat from <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written</b> with regard to both <i>teruma</i> and the Paschal lamb: <b>“A sojourner and a hired servant”?</b> From this it is derived by way of a verbal analogy that an uncircumcised priest may not partake of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Exodus 12:48 | and slaves precludes | Yevamot 70b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to include an uncircumcised priest in the prohibition against eating <i>teruma</i> and exclude an acute mourner? Perhaps just the opposite is true. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>lack of circumcision should be included</b> and should prevent a priest from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>as</b> the <i>halakhot</i> governing an uncircumcised man are stringent in several respects, as alluded to by the following mnemonic of key words: <b>Acts; <i>karetim</i>; the</b> divine <b>word; the slave.</b> The Gemara spells out these stringencies: An uncircumcised man <b>lacks</b> the <b>act</b> of circumcision, <b>and</b> this <b>act</b> is performed <b>on his body;</b> the failure to perform circumcision is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>;</b> circumcision <b>existed before the</b> divine <b>word</b> was spoken at Mount Sinai, as the mitzva of circumcision had already been given to Abraham; <b>and the</b> lack of <b>circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>and slaves precludes</b> one’s eating the Paschal lamb, as is explicitly stated in the Torah (Exodus 12:48). |
| Exodus 12:48 | at the time of the preparation, | Yevamot 71a:16 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the circumcision of one’s male</b> children <b>at the time of the preparation,</b> i.e., the slaughter, of the Paschal lamb, as it is stated: “Let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it” (Exodus 12:48), <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the circumcision of <b>one’s slaves at the time of the eating</b> of the Paschal lamb, as it is stated: “But every man’s servant…when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat from it” (Exodus 12:44). <b>From where</b> do I derive that it is proper <b>to apply</b> the prohibition <b>that was stated about this</b> case <b>to that</b> case, <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>that was said about that</b> case <b>to this</b> case, i.e., that the circumcision of both one’s male children and one’s slaves is indispensable both at the time of the preparation of the Paschal lamb and at the time of its consumption? The <i>tanna</i> answers that <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“then”</b> with regard to male children and the term <b>“then”</b> with regard to slaves <b>as a verbal analogy.</b> |
| Exodus 12:48 | “and then let him come near and keep it” | Yevamot 71a:19 | <b>Rava said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? How can you think that the lack of circumcision of a newborn child precludes his father’s eating from the Paschal lamb? Doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state: “Let all his males be circumcised,”</b> followed by <b>“and then let him come near and keep it”</b> (Exodus 12:48), <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> infant <b>is not</b> yet <b>fit for circumcision</b> he cannot possibly preclude the father’s partaking of the offering? <b>Rather, with what</b> case <b>are we dealing here?</b> With the case, <b>for example,</b> of a baby who was exempt from circumcision at the time of the preparation of the Paschal lamb because he was sick with a high fever, and subsequently <b>the fever left him</b> and he recovered. In such a case, failure to immediately circumcise his son precludes the father’s eating from the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 12:48 | “No uncircumcised person shall eat from it” | Yevamot 71a:2 | The Gemara asks further: If so, with regard to the phrase “from it” in the verse <b>“No uncircumcised person shall eat from it”</b> (Exodus 12:48), which again emphasizes “from it” and not from another item, <b>why do I</b> need it? The Gemara answers: This teaches that only <b>from it,</b> the Paschal lamb, one who is uncircumcised <b>may not eat, but he eats <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs.</b> One who is uncircumcised is obligated to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs on Passover, just like any other Jew. |
| Exodus 13:2 | From a generalization that requires a detail, and from a detail that requires a generalization. How so? | Bekhorot 19a:4 | With regard to the definition of a firstborn, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> can be derived by means of the form of exegesis known as: <b>From a generalization that requires a detail, and from a detail that requires a generalization. How so?</b> The verse states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, that which opens any womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal, it is Mine” (Exodus 13:2). Had the verse written only the generalization: <b>“Sanctify to Me all the firstborn,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a female</b> animal <b>is included</b> in the category of a firstborn. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the detail: “Every firstborn <b>male</b>…you shall sanctify to the Lord” (Deuteronomy 15:19). |
| Exodus 13:2 | all the firstborn, | Bekhorot 3a:9 | § A previously cited <i>baraita</i> (2b) states that if one receives an animal from a gentile to care for and receives a portion of the offspring in exchange, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the Jew’s portion is sanctified with firstborn status. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>as long as the ownership of the gentile</b> is involved, i.e., he owns a portion of the firstborn animal, it does not have firstborn status. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: And both of them interpreted</b> the same <b>one verse</b> in accordance with their opinions. The verse states: “Sanctify to Me <b>all the firstborn,</b> whatever opens the womb, among the children of Israel” (Exodus 13:2). |
| Exodus 13:2 | Israel” | Bekhorot 46a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> That son is <b>a firstborn with regard to inheritance and with regard to</b> redemption from <b>a priest, as it is stated:</b> “Whatever <b>opens the womb among</b> the children of <b>Israel”</b> (Exodus 13:2). This indicates that the halakhic status of a child born to the mother is not that of one who opens the womb <b>unless it opens the womb</b> of a woman <b>from the Jewish people.</b> |
| Exodus 13:2 | Israel” | Bekhorot 47a:10 | This statement serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says:</b> That son <b>is a firstborn with regard to inheritance and with regard to</b> redemption from <b>a priest, as it is stated:</b> “Whatever <b>opens the womb among</b> the children of <b>Israel”</b> (Exodus 13:2), i.e., one is not considered a firstborn <b>unless he opens the womb</b> of a woman <b>from the Jewish people,</b> and therefore the children that she bore before she converted are not considered to have opened her womb. Therefore, the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> he is <b>not</b> a firstborn with regard to redemption, as his mother’s womb was already opened when she was a gentile. |
| Exodus 13:2 | opens the womb | Bekhorot 47a:15 | <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says</b> a different explanation, <b>in the name of Rava: Actually,</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava is referring to a case <b>where</b> the daughter of a Levite <b>became pregnant from an Israelite. And</b> although the son’s status is usually determined by that of the father, <b>there,</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, <b>it is different, as the verse states:</b> “Whatever <b>opens the womb</b> among the children of Israel” (Exodus 13:2). This teaches that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the obligation <b>dependent upon the opening of the womb,</b> and since this firstborn came from the womb of a daughter of a Levite, and not a Levite, the obligation of redemption does not apply. |
| Exodus 13:2 | opens the womb” | Bekhorot 47b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that neither a son born by caesarean section nor the son who follows him are firstborn, neither with regard to inheritance nor with regard to redemption from a priest. The Gemara explains: The <b>first</b> son, born by caesarean section, is <b>not</b> considered the firstborn <b>with regard to inheritance,</b> as <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And they have borne him</b> children” (Deuteronomy 21:15), written in the context of inheritance, and a caesarean section is not called a birth. Likewise, <b>with regard to</b> the redemption with <b>five <i>sela</i></b> coins, this son is <b>also not</b> considered the firstborn, as <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “Whatever <b>opens the womb”</b> (Exodus 13:2), and he did not open his mother’s womb. |
| Exodus 13:2 | “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” | Bekhorot 4b:12 | The Gemara explains the reason for each opinion: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the <b>firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were sanctified, since the Merciful One states they should be sanctified, as it is written</b> prior to the Jews leaving Egypt: <b>“Sanctify to Me all the firstborn”</b> (Exodus 13:2). |
| Exodus 13:2 | did not cease | Bekhorot 4b:17 | The Gemara answers: <b>This was his difficulty: Granted, if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>did not cease</b> from the time that the mitzva of: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:2), was given in Egypt, and those born in the wilderness were also sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>who</b> were <b>originally</b> in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also did not lapse.</b> Therefore, they could perform the sacrificial service in the first years of the Tabernacle. <b>But if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>ceased</b> and the firstborn born in the wilderness were not sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>that</b> were <b>originally</b> born in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also lapsed.</b> |
| Exodus 13:2 | state? “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” | Bekhorot 4b:22 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You are found</b> to be <b>saying</b> that <b>the firstborn of the Jewish people were sanctified in three locations: In Egypt, and in the wilderness, and upon the entry of the Jewish people into Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>In Egypt, what does</b> the verse <b>state? “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn”</b> (Exodus 13:2). <b>In the wilderness,</b> the verse <b>states: “For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine”</b> (Numbers 8:17). <b>With regard to their entry into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the verse <b>states: “And it shall be when</b> the Lord <b>shall bring you</b> into the land of the Canaanites…<b>and you shall set apart</b> all firstborn of the womb to the Lord” (Exodus 13:11–12). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the firstborn born in the wilderness were sanctified. |
| Exodus 13:2 | Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught | Eruvin 96a:6 | Since the topic of phylacteries was discussed, the Gemara continues to explore this issue. <b>Whom did you hear</b> who said that <b>Shabbat is</b> a fit <b>time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the section in the Torah beginning with: “Sanctify all firstborns to me” (Exodus 13:2), which deals with the mitzvot of the Paschal lamb and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10), which indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days</b> [<b><i>yamim</i></b>] <b>and not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i> in <b>“from year” [<i>miyamim</i>]</b> teaches: <b>But not</b> on <b>all days;</b> this <b>excludes Shabbat and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Exodus 13:2 | dependent upon the opening of the womb, | Kiddushin 29b:6 | <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one had five</b> firstborn <b>sons, from five</b> different <b>women, he is obligated to redeem them all? The verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), and the emphasis of “all” includes any of one’s firstborn sons. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> this is the case? After all, <b>the Merciful One made</b> this mitzva <b>dependent upon the opening of the womb,</b> as it states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, whoever opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2). Since each of these sons is the firstborn of his mother, it is clear that the father is required to redeem each of them. |
| Exodus 13:2 | that takes the form of a person; | Niddah 23b:1 | <b>We, too, learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a) that the fetus of a woman that has the form of an animal cannot survive: In the case of a woman <b>who</b> had previously <b>discharged a fetus</b> with the appearance <b>similar to</b> that <b>of a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or bird</b> before giving birth to any children, and subsequently she gives birth to a son, the son is considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, but he does not require redemption, as the fetus is considered a full-fledged offspring in that regard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The son is not exempted from the requirement of redemption from a priest <b>unless</b> it follows the birth of a fetus <b>that takes the form of a person;</b> otherwise, it is not considered the offspring that “opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2), and the son requires redemption as a firstborn. |
| Exodus 13:3 | “The nation [ ha’am ]” | Menachot 29b:1 | had the <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> in</b> the term: <b>“The nation [<i>ha’am</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:3), written in his phylacteries, <b>severed by a perforation. He came before</b> his son-in-law <b>Rabbi Abba</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: If there remains in</b> the leg that is attached to the roof of the letter <b>the equivalent of the measure of a small letter,</b> i.e., the letter <i>yod</i>, it is <b>fit. But if not,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Exodus 13:3 | benefit from leavened bread on Passover? As it is stated: “Leavened bread shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 21b:5 | <b>Ḥizkiya said: From where</b> is it derived in the mishna <b>that it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from leavened bread on Passover? As it is stated: “Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3). Since the verse uses the passive, it should be understood as follows: <b>There shall be no permitted consumption of it</b> at all, even deriving benefit, as benefit could be exchanged for money, which could be used to buy food. The Gemara reads precisely: <b>The reason</b> deriving benefit is prohibited <b>is that the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah<b>: “Leavened bread shall not be eaten.” Had</b> the Torah <b>not written: “Shall not be eaten,”</b> and instead used the active form: You shall not eat, <b>I would have said</b> that the <b>prohibition of eating is implied</b> but that <b>the prohibition of</b> deriving <b>benefit is not implied.</b> |
| Exodus 13:3 | “Leavened bread shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 28b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There are three verses</b> that <b>are written</b> with regard to this prohibition, and in Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion each one teaches that the prohibition applies at a different time. One verse states: <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3). Another verse states: <b>“And all that which is leavened you shall not eat;</b> in all your habitations you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). And a third verse states: <b>“You shall eat no leavened bread with it”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread even <b>before its time,</b> on Passover eve. <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread <b>after its time</b> as well, if a Jew owned it during Passover. <b>And one verse</b> indicates that the prohibition applies <b>during Passover</b> itself. |
| Exodus 13:3 | “Leavened bread shall not be eaten” | Pesachim 29a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which was taught</b> in the mishna: Leavened bread that <b>belonged to a Jew is forbidden because it is stated: “It shall not be seen”</b> (Exodus 13:7). According to this explanation, the connection between the prohibition against deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover and the verse prohibiting seeing leaven during Passover is clear. The prohibition against deriving benefit from this leavened bread is a rabbinically instituted fine for transgressing the Torah prohibition of “It shall not be seen.” <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> which states that our mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and which renders forbidden by Torah law deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover, why is this verse cited? The mishna <b>should have said</b> that it is forbidden <b>due to</b> the verse <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3), as that is the verse from which Rabbi Yehuda derives this prohibition. |
| Exodus 13:3 | leavened bread applied for only one day? The verse states: “No leavened bread shall be eaten” | Pesachim 96b:1 | <b>Rather,</b> it refers <b>to leavened bread,</b> which is prohibited all seven days of Passover in the generations following the Exodus. The Gemara asks: Does this prove <b>by inference that</b> during <b>the Passover of Egypt,</b> leaven was prohibited for only <b>one night and not more? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>the Passover of Egypt that its</b> prohibition of <b>leavened bread applied for only one day? The verse states: “No leavened bread shall be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> the verse states: <b>“This day you go forth”</b> (Exodus 13:4), to teach that the prohibition of leaven applied in Egypt for only one day. In any event, the prohibition applied for an entire night and day, and not just one night. |
| Exodus 13:3 | and it is written there: “And Moses said to the people: Remember this day, | Shabbat 86b:5 | <b>The Sages taught: On the sixth</b> day <b>of the month</b> of Sivan, <b>the Ten Commandments were given to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says: On the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> the month. <b>Rava said: Everyone agrees</b> that the Jews <b>came to the Sinai desert on the New Moon,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, <b>the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai”</b> (Exodus 19:1), without elaborating what day it was. <b>And it is written there: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months;</b> it shall be the first month of the year to you” (Exodus 12:2). <b>Just as there,</b> the term “this” is referring to the <b>New Moon, so too, here</b> the term is referring to the <b>New Moon. And</b> similarly, <b>everyone agrees that the Torah was given to the Jewish people on Shabbat,</b> as <b>it is written here</b> in the Ten Commandments: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8), <b>and it is written there: “And Moses said to the people: Remember this day,</b> in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place; there shall be no leaven eaten” (Exodus 13:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of the Exodus, <b>so too, here</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of Shabbat. <b>Where</b> Rabbi Yosei and the Sages <b>disagree</b> is <b>with regard to the determination of the month,</b> meaning which day of the week was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yosei held:</b> The <b>New Moon was established on the first day of the week, and on the first day of the week He did not say anything to them due to the weariness</b> caused by <b>the journey. On the second day of the week, He said to them: “And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests</b> and a holy nation; these are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:6). |
| Exodus 13:4 | “This day you go forth | Pesachim 28b:6 | The verse <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten” is</b> also <b>required</b> for another <i>halakha</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the</b> prohibition against eating <b>leavened bread</b> during <b>the</b> first <b>Passover in Egypt applied for only one day? The verse states: “Leavened bread shall not be eaten,”</b> and this is <b>juxtaposed to</b> the verse that states: <b>“This day you go forth</b> in the month of spring” (Exodus 13:4). This indicates that the prohibition against eating leavened bread during the first Passover in Egypt applied for only that one day. |
| Exodus 13:4 | “This day you go forth” | Pesachim 96b:1 | <b>Rather,</b> it refers <b>to leavened bread,</b> which is prohibited all seven days of Passover in the generations following the Exodus. The Gemara asks: Does this prove <b>by inference that</b> during <b>the Passover of Egypt,</b> leaven was prohibited for only <b>one night and not more? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>the Passover of Egypt that its</b> prohibition of <b>leavened bread applied for only one day? The verse states: “No leavened bread shall be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> the verse states: <b>“This day you go forth”</b> (Exodus 13:4), to teach that the prohibition of leaven applied in Egypt for only one day. In any event, the prohibition applied for an entire night and day, and not just one night. |
| Exodus 13:5 | that you shall perform this service in this month” | Menachot 82b:2 | Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> The Paschal offerings should be compared, <b>as the</b> verse <b>states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering of the generations: “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, <b>that you shall perform this service in this month”</b> (Exodus 13:5). This indicates <b>that all the services of this month</b> for the generations <b>shall be like this,</b> the Paschal offering of Egypt. |
| Exodus 13:5 | that you shall perform this service in this month” | Pesachim 96a:11 | <b>Similarly, the Paschal lamb</b> sacrificed in later <b>generations</b> also requires examination four days prior to slaughter, <b>as it is written:</b> “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, <b>that you shall perform this service in this month”</b> (Exodus 13:5). From here it is derived <b>that all the services of this month</b> for all later generations <b>shall be like this,</b> including examination of the animal four days prior to sacrifice. Despite the fact that the verse connects the Paschal lamb in later years to the Paschal lamb in Egypt, the requirement to take the animal on the tenth of Nisan applied only on the first Passover. |
| Exodus 13:5 | service | Pesachim 96a:13 | Once again the Gemara questions its assertion that the phrase “this month” stated in the context of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt indicates that its <i>halakhot</i> are not relevant to other offerings. <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> with regard to that <b>which is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8), <b>so too,</b> should it be inferred that <b>this</b> Paschal lamb offered in Egypt <b>was eaten at night and no other</b> Paschal lamb offered in later generations must <b>be eaten at night?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall perform</b> this <b>service</b> in this month” (Exodus 13:5), in order to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt apply to later generations as well. |
| Exodus 13:7 | “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be found in all your borders” | Beitzah 7b:14 | <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be found in all your borders”</b> (Exodus 13:7). <b>This</b> obligation to remove leavened bread <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as Beit Shammai say:</b> The measure that determines liability for removal of <b>leaven</b> is <b>an olive-bulk, and</b> the measure for leavened bread is <b>a large date-bulk, and Beit Hillel say:</b> The measure for <b>both this and that</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is with regard to the obligation to remove leavened bread, not liability for eating it. |
| Exodus 13:7 | no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you, | Pesachim 10b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one must conduct a search three times? The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna who both say:</b> The requirement to conduct three searches <b>corresponds to</b> the <b>three</b> times that <b>the removal</b> of leaven <b>is</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> One verse says: “<i>Matzot</i> shall be eaten for seven days, and <b>no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: <b>“Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), while a third verse says: “Seven days shall you eat <i>matzot</i>, <b>yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15). |
| Exodus 13:7 | neither shall there be leaven seen with you, | Pesachim 23a:12 | The Gemara further challenges the opinions of Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Abbahu: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition of <b>leavened bread,</b> as <b>the Merciful One says: “Leavened bread shall not be eaten,”</b> and <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Be astounded with yourself; how is it prohibited</b> to derive <b>benefit</b> from <b>leavened bread</b> for <b>all seven</b> days? Apparently, he holds that it is permitted for one to derive benefit from leavened bread for all seven days of Passover and certainly afterward. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse said:</b> “<i>Matzot</i> shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, <b>neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7). The phrase “with you” indicates that <b>it is yours,</b> i.e., it is still considered to be in one’s possession, and it is permitted for him to derive benefit from it. |
| Exodus 13:7 | neither shall there be leaven seen with you, | Pesachim 28a:10 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is permitted</b> for a Jew <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit from leavened bread of a gentile over which Passover has elapsed,</b> i.e., leavened bread that remains after the conclusion of Passover. However, <b>it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> leaven <b>of a Jew</b> over which Passover has elapsed, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you, <b>neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7). |
| Exodus 13:7 | belonged to a Jew is forbidden because it is stated: “It shall not be seen” | Pesachim 29a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which was taught</b> in the mishna: Leavened bread that <b>belonged to a Jew is forbidden because it is stated: “It shall not be seen”</b> (Exodus 13:7). According to this explanation, the connection between the prohibition against deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover and the verse prohibiting seeing leaven during Passover is clear. The prohibition against deriving benefit from this leavened bread is a rabbinically instituted fine for transgressing the Torah prohibition of “It shall not be seen.” <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> which states that our mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and which renders forbidden by Torah law deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover, why is this verse cited? The mishna <b>should have said</b> that it is forbidden <b>due to</b> the verse <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3), as that is the verse from which Rabbi Yehuda derives this prohibition. |
| Exodus 13:7 | with you | Pesachim 5b:12 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This <i>tanna</i> seeks permission</b> for seeing the leaven of a gentile, and yet <b>he cites a verse to</b> establish <b>a prohibition.</b> The Gemara answers that the <i>tanna</i> did not cite proof from the phrase: It shall not be found. <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated:</b> “No leaven shall be seen <b>with you</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7) and “No leaven shall be seen <b>with you</b> in all your borders” (Deuteronomy 16:4) <b>twice,</b> one of them is superfluous and may be appended to: It shall not be found, creating the prohibition: It shall not be found with you. Only leaven belonging to a Jew is prohibited. |
| Exodus 13:7 | no leaven shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leavened bread seen with you, in all your borders” | Pesachim 5b:2 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19). To <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state</b> this prohibition? <b>Wasn’t it already stated:</b> “And <b>no leaven shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leavened bread seen with you, in all your borders”</b> (Exodus 13:7)? |
| Exodus 13:7 | the volume of an olive-bulk | Yoma 79b:5 | Until now, the Gemara has assumed that the volume of a large date is more than that of an egg. <b>Rav Zevid</b> disagreed with what was mentioned earlier and <b>said:</b> This is not so. Rather, <b>the volume of a large date that they spoke</b> of <b>is less than an egg-bulk, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> With regard to <b>leaven,</b> the sourdough used to make dough rise, ownership of <b>the volume of an olive-bulk</b> violates the prohibitions in the following verses stated regarding Passover: “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you” (Exodus 13:7) and “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19). However, the amount of <b>leavened bread</b> that must be owned to violate the prohibition <b>is the volume of a large date.</b> |
| Exodus 13:8 | left Egypt, as it is stated: “And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: It is because of this which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt” | Pesachim 116b:3 | The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna further states: <b>In each and every generation a person must view himself as though he</b> personally <b>left Egypt, as it is stated: “And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: It is because of this which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 13:8). In every generation, each person must say: “This which the Lord did for me,” and not: This which the Lord did for my forefathers. |
| Exodus 13:8 | it is because of this | Pesachim 116b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: A blind</b> person <b>is exempt from reciting</b> the <b>Haggadah.</b> The proof is that <b>it is written here,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And you shall tell your son on that day saying, <b>it is because of this</b> which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:8), <b>and it was written there,</b> with regard to the stubborn and rebellious son, that his parents say: <b>“This son of ours</b> is stubborn and rebellious, he does not listen to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard” (Deuteronomy 21:20). The Gemara explains the verbal analogy of the word “this”: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the rebellious son, the Sages expound that the verse <b>excludes a blind</b> person, as a blind parent cannot say: This son of ours, for he cannot point to him; <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the recitation of the Passover Haggadah, the word “this” <b>excludes blind</b> people. |
| Exodus 13:9 | your hand [ yadkha ]” | Arakhin 19b:6 | The Gemara answers: The term <i>yad</i> written <b>in the Torah</b> indicates <b>up to the wrist,</b> but <b>with regard to vows</b> one <b>follows</b> the ordinary <b>language of people,</b> in which the word <i>yad</i> is referring to the forearm until the elbow. Consequently, the vow is interpreted in this manner. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does the word <i>yad</i> that is written <b>in the Torah</b> mean <b>up to the wrist? But with regard to phylacteries it is written:</b> “And it shall be for a sign to you upon <b>your hand [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), <b>and the school of Menashe taught: <i>Yadkha</i>; this</b> is referring to the bulge of the <b>biceps [<i>kibborit</i>]</b> on the upper arm. |
| Exodus 13:9 | the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, | Eruvin 96a:10 | The Gemara returns to the issue at hand: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> really <b>hold that Shabbat is a time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person should don phylacteries on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm,</b> and for a remembrance between your eyes, so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). The obligation to don phylacteries applies when Jews <b>require a sign</b> to assert their Judaism and their status as the Chosen People, i.e., during the week, <b>excluding</b> Shabbat and Festivals, <b>as they are themselves signs</b> of Israel’s status as the Chosen People and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days. This teaching proves that Rabbi Akiva maintains that Shabbat is not a fit time for donning phylacteries. |
| Exodus 13:9 | “And it shall be a sign for you on your arm and for a memorial between your eyes, that the Torah of the Lord may be in your mouth” | Kiddushin 35a:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>And who is</b> the scholar called by the nickname: The Sages of Pafunya? It is <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who said as follows: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to phylacteries: <b>“And it shall be a sign for you on your arm and for a memorial between your eyes, that the Torah of the Lord may be in your mouth”</b> (Exodus 13:9). In this manner <b>the entire Torah is juxtaposed to phylacteries: Just as</b> donning <b>phylacteries is a positive, time-bound mitzva and women are exempt</b> from it, <b>so too are women exempt</b> from <b>every positive, time-bound mitzva</b> in the Torah. <b>And from the fact</b> that <b>women are exempt from</b> every <b>positive, time-bound mitzva,</b> one can learn <b>by inference</b> that <b>women are obligated in</b> every <b>positive mitzva that is not time bound.</b> |
| Exodus 13:9 | in order that the Torah of God shall be in your mouth” | Makkot 11a:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to the one who says</b> that the Torah scroll is <b>unfit</b> for use, the reason is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to phylacteries: “And it shall be for you a sign on your hand and a memorial between your eyes, <b>in order that the Torah of God shall be in your mouth”</b> (Exodus 13:9). <b>And</b> in this verse <b>the entire Torah is juxtaposed</b> and likened <b>to phylacteries: Just as</b> with regard to <b>phylacteries,</b> there is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai to sew them with sinews, so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sheets of the Torah scroll, there is a requirement <b>to sew them with sinews. And the other</b> Sage holds: <b>When</b> the Torah scroll <b>is juxtaposed</b> and likened to phylacteries, it is only <b>with regard to</b> the principle that the sheets of the Torah scroll may be prepared only from a species of animal <b>that is permitted to your mouth,</b> i.e., that it is permitted for a Jew to eat; but with regard <b>to its</b> other <b><i>halakhot</i>, it is not juxtaposed</b> and likened to phylacteries. |
| Exodus 13:9 | the verse states: “And for a memorial between your eyes” | Menachot 34b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that a scribe <b>should write</b> the passages of the phylacteries of the head <b>on four</b> separate <b>hides,</b> i.e., parchments, <b>and place them in four compartments of four hides,</b> one passage in each compartment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And for a memorial between your eyes”</b> (Exodus 13:9). This teaches: <b>I said to you</b> that the phylacteries are <b>one memorial, but not</b> that they are <b>two or three memorials,</b> i.e., the phylacteries themselves must be one unit. <b>How so?</b> One <b>writes</b> the passages <b>on four hides and places them in four compartments</b> fashioned <b>of one hide.</b> |
| Exodus 13:9 | as it is stated: “And it shall be for a sign for you upon your arm” | Menachot 34b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does</b> a scribe <b>write them?</b> With regard to <b>the phylacteries of the arm, he writes it on one hide. But if he wrote it on four</b> separate <b>hides and placed it in one compartment,</b> one who wears it has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> in such a case <b>it is necessary to attach</b> the four parchments, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall be for a sign for you upon your arm”</b> (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the phylacteries of the arm are <b>one sign on the outside,</b> as the compartment is fashioned from a single hide, <b>so too,</b> they must be <b>one sign on the inside,</b> i.e., the four passages must be on a single parchment. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: It is not necessary</b> to attach the passages. |
| Exodus 13:9 | your arm [ yadkha ]” | Menachot 36b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And it shall be for a sign for you on <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:9), that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>left</b> arm. <b>Do you say</b> it means the <b>left</b> arm, <b>or is it only</b> the <b>right</b> arm? <b>The verse states: “Even My hand [<i>yadi</i>] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [<i>vimini</i>] has spread out the heavens”</b> (Isaiah 48:13). <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “Her hand [<i>yadah</i>] she put to the tent pin, and her right hand [<i>viminah</i>] to the workmen’s hammer”</b> (Judges 5:26), <b>and</b> another verse <b>states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [<i>yadkha</i>], even Your right hand [<i>viminekha</i>]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them”</b> (Psalms 74:11). All these verses employ the term <i>yad</i> with regard to the left hand, and use the term <i>yamin</i>, literally, right, without the term <i>yad</i>, to indicate the right hand. |
| Exodus 13:9 | the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, and for a remembrance between your eyes, | Menachot 36b:5 | The Gemara answers: Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>derives</b> the exemption from the obligation to don phylacteries on Shabbat <b>from</b> a different source, the source <b>where Rabbi Akiva derives it from, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person should don phylacteries on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, and for a remembrance between your eyes,</b> so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that the obligation to don phylacteries applies when the Jewish people <b>require a sign</b> to assert their status as God’s nation, i.e., during the week. This serves to <b>exclude <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals, as they themselves are signs</b> of the Jewish people’s status as God’s nation and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days. |
| Exodus 13:9 | states: “And it shall be for a sign for you | Menachot 37b:3 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And it shall be for a sign for you</b> upon your arm” (Exodus 13:9), which teaches: It shall be <b>a sign for you, but not a sign for others,</b> i.e., one must don the phylacteries of the arm in a place where they are not seen by others. This is the arm, which is usually covered, whereas the hand is usually visible. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “Therefore you shall place these words in your heart</b> and in your soul, <b>and you shall bind them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:18). This teaches <b>that placing</b> the words, i.e., donning the phylacteries, <b>shall be opposite the heart,</b> on the bicep. |
| Exodus 13:9 | As the Sages taught: “Between your eyes” | Menachot 37b:5 | With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the phylacteries of the head are donned on the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As the Sages taught: “Between your eyes”</b> (Exodus 13:9); <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head. Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, or is it only literally between your eyes? It is stated here: “Between your eyes,” and it is stated there:</b> “You shall not cut yourselves, <b>nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), <b>Just as there,</b> the phrase “between your eyes” is referring to a place <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head,</b> as that is <b>a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald</b> by removing his hair, <b>so too,</b> the place where phylacteries are donned is <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald.</b> |
| Exodus 13:9 | so that God’s Torah will be in your mouth” | Shabbat 108a:6 | It was reported: <b>Shmuel and Karna were sitting on the bank of the Malka River. They saw that the water was rising and was murky.</b> Shmuel <b>said to Karna: A great man is coming from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and his intestines are aching, and the water is rising to greet him. Go sniff</b> out <b>his container,</b> i.e., see if he is a Torah scholar. Karna <b>went</b> and <b>found Rav,</b> who was the Sage that came from Eretz Yisrael, and he asked him several questions to test him. <b>He said to him: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may write phylacteries only on the hide of a kosher animal?</b> Rav <b>said to him</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as it is written:</b> “And it shall be a sign for you on your arm, and a reminder between your eyes, <b>so that God’s Torah will be in your mouth”</b> (Exodus 13:9). Only hide <b>from those</b> animals <b>that are permitted</b> to be placed <b>in your mouth,</b> i.e., may be eaten, may be used for phylacteries. Karna then asked him: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> prohibited <b>blood is red?</b> Karna asked Rav this to determine which shades of menstrual blood are impure. Rav said to him that it is <b>as it is stated: “And the Moabites saw the water from afar, red like blood”</b> (II Kings 3:22). |
| Exodus 13:9 | that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth” | Shabbat 28b:2 | Since the conclusion was that the hide of even a non-kosher animal can become ritually impure as a tent over a corpse, it is not necessary to assume that the covering of the Tabernacle was made specifically from the hide of a kosher animal. <b>And,</b> if so, <b>that which Rav Yosef taught: Only the hide of a kosher animal was suitable for heavenly service, for what <i>halakha</i></b> is that relevant, as it is clearly not relevant to the Tabernacle? The Gemara replies: This <i>halakha</i> was stated with regard <b>to phylacteries,</b> which may be prepared only from the hide of a kosher animal. The Gemara asks: <b>Phylacteries?</b> Why did Rav Yosef need to state that <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>written explicitly with regard to them:</b> “And it shall be for a sign unto you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, <b>that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth”</b> (Exodus 13:9). The Sages derived from there that the phylacteries must be prepared <b>from that which is permitted</b> to be eaten <b>in your mouth.</b> |
| Exodus 13:10 | “And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [ miyamim ] to year” | Eruvin 96a:6 | Since the topic of phylacteries was discussed, the Gemara continues to explore this issue. <b>Whom did you hear</b> who said that <b>Shabbat is</b> a fit <b>time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the section in the Torah beginning with: “Sanctify all firstborns to me” (Exodus 13:2), which deals with the mitzvot of the Paschal lamb and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10), which indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days</b> [<b><i>yamim</i></b>] <b>and not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i> in <b>“from year” [<i>miyamim</i>]</b> teaches: <b>But not</b> on <b>all days;</b> this <b>excludes Shabbat and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> |
| Exodus 13:10 | “And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [ miyamim ] to year” | Menachot 36b:4 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the passage of the Torah that discusses both the mitzvot of the Paschal offering and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10). This indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days [<i>yamim</i>] but not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i>, meaning from, in the term: <b>“From year [<i>miyamim</i>],”</b> teaches: These mitzvot apply on some days, <b>but not</b> on <b>all days.</b> This <b>excludes <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says: This</b> verse, mentioning <b>an ordinance, is stated only with regard to the Paschal</b> offering, and it is not referring to phylacteries at all. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says that at night one is exempt from the obligation of donning phylacteries, says that on Shabbat one is exempt as well. |
| Exodus 13:11 | shall bring you | Bekhorot 4b:13 | <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> Although the firstborn in Egypt were sanctified, <b>the firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were not sanctified, as it is written: “And it shall be when</b> the Lord <b>shall bring you</b> into the land of the Canaanites” (Exodus 13:11), <b>and it is written afterward: “And you shall set apart</b> all firstborn of the womb to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). <b>By inference,</b> it can be derived <b>that initially,</b> before the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, those that were born in the wilderness <b>were not sanctified.</b> |
| Exodus 13:11 | coming, which the Merciful One writes with regard to phylacteries and the firstborn donkey, | Kiddushin 37b:13 | The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>coming, which the Merciful One writes with regard to phylacteries and the firstborn donkey,</b> at the start of the Torah passage which discusses these mitzvot: “And it shall be when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite” (Exodus 13:11)? The Gemara answers: <b>That verse is necessary for that which</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Perform this mitzva</b> of donning phylacteries, <b>on account of which</b> you shall be rewarded and <b>enter Eretz</b> Yisrael. |
| Exodus 13:12 | passing, | Bava Kamma78a:5 | <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to firstborn</b> animals, concerning which it is written: “However, the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or <i>seh</i>, it is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 27:26), it is not necessary in that context either. The reason is that this can be <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>passing,</b> in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to the Lord all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term <b>passing, from</b> a verse concerning <b>animal tithe:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here. |
| Exodus 13:12 | the males shall be to the Lord” | Bekhorot 17a:21 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a ewe that had not</b> previously <b>given birth, and it gave birth to two males and both their heads emerged as one, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Both of them</b> are given <b>to the priest, as it is stated</b> in the plural: “Every firstborn that you have of animals, <b>the males shall be to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 13:12). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>impossible</b> for two events <b>to coincide precisely,</b> i.e., their births were not at precisely the same time. <b>Rather,</b> one preceded the other, and therefore <b>one</b> of the males is given <b>to</b> the owner <b>and one to the priest.</b> |
| Exodus 13:12 | pass” | Bekhorot 21b:3 | The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary, it would be</b> appropriate <b>for one to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of tithed animals <b>from sacrificial</b> animals, <b>as</b> they have the following in common: First, unlike firstborn animals, both tithed and consecrated animals are not limited to <b>males.</b> Second, both are sanctified by human action rather than intrinsically <b>consecrated.</b> Additionally, they are not included among the <b>gifts</b> to the priest. Finally, both begin life as <b>regular</b> animals rather than as animals with the unique status of being born first. The Gemara accepts this objection: <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy between the term: “You shall <b>pass”</b> (Exodus 13:12), written with regard to the firstborn, and the term: “Whatsoever <b>passes</b> under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), stated with regard to tithed animals. |
| Exodus 13:12 | emerges from [ sheger ] an animal” | Bekhorot 3a:17 | <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this:</b> Why does gentile partnership in an essential limb of the fetus exempt the Jew from the obligations of firstborn status? In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this animal <b>different from non-viable newborns, which are sacred even though they are not viable? As the Master said</b> in reference to the verse: “Every <b>firstborn</b> that <b>emerges from [<i>sheger</i>] an animal”</b> (Exodus 13:12), any fetus <b>that dwells [<i>shegar</i>] inside an animal,</b> i.e., inside the mother’s womb, even one that is non-viable, is also sanctified as a firstborn. |
| Exodus 13:12 | “That is a male” | Bekhorot 41b:8 | The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis,</b> who maintain that a hermaphrodite is not a male, but a distinct entity. <b>And</b> as for the difficulty that in the case of a firstborn they excluded a female, a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite from a single verse, that is not so. <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> there are also <b>two verses written: “Males”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), and: <b>“That is a male”</b> (Exodus 13:12). As in the case of a burnt offering, one of these serves to exclude a female, while the other serves to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite. |
| Exodus 13:12 | “Firstborn of the womb” | Bekhorot 4a:10 | The Gemara answers the last question: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult, as</b> it is in accordance with the statement <b>of Mar, son of Rav Yosef, in the name of Rava, who says:</b> The fact that the Torah states with regard to the sanctity of the firstborn: <b>“Firstborn of the womb”</b> (Exodus 13:12), indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the obligations of firstborn status <b>dependent on</b> being <b>the firstborn of the womb,</b> i.e., of the mother. Therefore, the mother’s status as a Levite is sufficient to exempt the child from firstborn status. |
| Exodus 13:12 | and it is written afterward: “And you shall set apart | Bekhorot 4b:13 | <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> Although the firstborn in Egypt were sanctified, <b>the firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were not sanctified, as it is written: “And it shall be when</b> the Lord <b>shall bring you</b> into the land of the Canaanites” (Exodus 13:11), <b>and it is written afterward: “And you shall set apart</b> all firstborn of the womb to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). <b>By inference,</b> it can be derived <b>that initially,</b> before the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, those that were born in the wilderness <b>were not sanctified.</b> |
| Exodus 13:12 | shall be yours | Bekhorot 56b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That you shall set apart for the Lord all that opens the womb; every firstborn male that emerges from an animal that <b>shall be yours</b> belongs to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). This teaches that the obligation of animal tithe applies only to an animal that belongs to you, i.e., to one owner, <b>but not</b> to an animal owned <b>by partners.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the obligation of the tithe does not apply to the animal <b>even if</b> brothers <b>acquired</b> the animals through inheritance <b>from</b> the property in <b>the possession of</b> their father’s <b>house.</b> Therefore, the <b>verse states: “Shall be,”</b> to include animals acquired through inheritance in the obligation of animal tithe. |
| Exodus 13:12 | the males shall be the Lord’s” | Bekhorot 9a:8 | <b>Abaye says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and it <b>is different there</b> with regard to a kosher animal, <b>as it is written:</b> “Every firstborn that you have of animals, <b>the males shall be the Lord’s”</b> (Exodus 13:12), i.e., the word “males” is written in the plural. This indicates that if they emerged simultaneously they both have firstborn status. By contrast, with regard to redeeming a firstborn donkey, only one has firstborn status. |
| Exodus 13:12 | a firstborn | Temurah 5b:13 | The Gemara explains that Abaye could <b>say to you: It is different there, as one derives</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a firstborn offering, by verbal analogy between the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to an animal tithe offering: “Whatsoever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), and the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering: “You shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] to the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12). It was already derived above that a firstborn offering cannot be redeemed. But in general, transgressions are effective. |
| Exodus 13:12 | with regard to a firstborn. | Zevachim 37b:6 | <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who interprets the entire</b> verse as dealing <b>with a firstborn, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the substitute of</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>and</b> of <b>a Paschal offering are not sacrificed?</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>he derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>passing,</b> and <b>passing</b> written <b>with regard to a firstborn.</b> Concerning a firstborn it is stated: “And you shall pass [<i>veha’avarta</i>] to the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and concerning an animal tithe it is stated: “Of whatever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32). From this verbal analogy it may be derived that just as the substitute of a firstborn is not sacrificed, so too, the substitute of an animal tithe offering is not sacrificed. |
| Exodus 13:12 | a firstborn too, | Zevachim 9a:8 | The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>a firstborn too,</b> the verse states: “That you shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] unto the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12). Since with regard to the animal tithe it is stated: “Whatever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod, the tenth shall be holy” (Leviticus 27:32), it is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between the <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> stated with regard to a firstborn and the <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> stated with regard to the animal <b>tithe</b> that a Paschal offering cannot become a firstborn either. |
| Exodus 13:13 | and a firstborn donkey | Avodah Zarah74a:3 | <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> also applies to <b>birds</b> designated for the purification <b>of a leper</b> (Leviticus 14:1–6), <b>and the</b> shorn <b>hair of a nazirite</b> (Numbers 6:18), <b>and a firstborn donkey</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>and meat</b> that was cooked <b>in milk</b> (Exodus 23:19), <b>and the scapegoat</b> of Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:7–10), <b>and</b> the meat of <b>a non-sacred</b> animal <b>that was slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> All of <b>these</b> are <b>forbidden</b> themselves, <b>and any amount</b> of them <b>renders</b> a mixture <b>forbidden.</b> |
| Exodus 13:13 | sanctified, | Bava Kamma54a:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail,</b> from which the exclusion of birds could be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> detail <b>should</b> the Torah <b>write? If</b> it <b>writes</b> only <b>an ox, I would say</b> that an item that <b>is sacrificed on the altar,</b> such as an ox, <b>indeed</b> renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an item <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. <b>And if the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>a donkey, I would say:</b> Those animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>sanctified,</b> such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), do <b>indeed</b> render their owners liable, but animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>not sanctified</b> do <b>not</b> render them liable. Therefore, the Torah states both an ox and a donkey. |
| Exodus 13:13 | sanctified, | Bava Kamma54b:17 | The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail</b> from which this could be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> detail <b>should</b> the <b>Merciful One write? If the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>an ox, I would say:</b> An animal that <b>is sacrificed on the altar,</b> such as an ox, <b>indeed</b> renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an animal <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. <b>And if the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>a donkey, I would say:</b> An animal whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>sanctified,</b> such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), does <b>indeed</b> render him liable, but an animal whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>not sanctified</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> both <b>an ox</b> and a donkey. |
| Exodus 13:13 | a firstborn donkey, | Bava Kamma78a:7 | <b>Rather, Rava’s</b> principle <b>was stated with regard to</b> the redemption of <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> concerning which it is written: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a <i>seh</i>” (Exodus 13:13), <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 12a): <b>One may not redeem</b> a firstborn donkey <b>neither with a calf, nor with a non-domesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>nor with a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, <b>nor with diverse kinds,</b> i.e., a sheep-goat hybrid, <b>nor with a <i>koy</i>.</b> Rava’s principle is referring to the source for the prohibition against using an animal of diverse kinds for the redemption of a firstborn donkey. |
| Exodus 13:13 | then you shall break its neck” | Bekhorot 10b:16 | <b>And Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say it? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Torah states: “And if you do not redeem it, <b>then you shall break its neck”</b> (Exodus 13:13). The expression of <b>breaking the neck is stated here, and</b> the expression of <b>breaking the neck is stated there</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken (see Deuteronomy 21:4). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the heifer whose neck is broken, it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from it following the ceremony, <b>so too here, it is prohibited</b> to derive benefit from a firstborn donkey following the breaking of its neck. |
| Exodus 13:13 | breaking the neck stands in place of redeeming | Bekhorot 10b:18 | <b>Rav Sheshet said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Safra, your colleague, interpreted it</b> as follows: <b>Actually, Rabbi Yehuda</b> is the <i>tanna</i> cited, <b>and it was necessary</b> for the verse to prohibit deriving benefit after the donkey’s death as well, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>breaking the neck stands in place of redeeming</b> the donkey, as it is stated: “And if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13). Therefore, it could be claimed that <b>just as redemption permits</b> one to derive benefit from the firstborn donkey, <b>so too, breaking the neck permits</b> one to derive benefit from it. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that breaking the neck does not permit one to derive benefit from it. |
| Exodus 13:13 | a lamb” | Bekhorot 12a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the first clause of <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey: “And you shall redeem a firstborn donkey with <b>a lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man <b>a lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:3). By inference, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the Torah <b>excludes all of these names,</b> i.e., all of these types of animals listed in the mishna, from being fit for sacrifice as a Paschal offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey, the Torah <b>excludes all of these names.</b> |
| Exodus 13:13 | the verse states: “You shall redeem” | Bekhorot 12a:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the Paschal offering, then perhaps <b>just as there,</b> the Paschal offering must be a lamb that is <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year</b> (Exodus 12:5), <b>so too here,</b> the lamb must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 13:13), and: <b>“You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20). This repetition serves to <b>include</b> female lambs, blemished lambs, and lambs that are beyond their first year. |
| Exodus 13:13 | takes precedence over the mitzva of breaking the neck, as it is stated: “If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck” | Bekhorot 13a:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one did not wish to redeem</b> the firstborn donkey, <b>he breaks its neck from behind and buries it. The mitzva of redeeming</b> the firstborn donkey <b>takes precedence over the mitzva of breaking the neck, as it is stated: “If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck”</b> (Exodus 13:13). |
| Exodus 13:13 | generations | Bekhorot 4b:2 | § Rav Safra (4a) referred to the fact that the sanctity of the firstborn donkeys of the Israelites was abrogated by the lambs of the Levites. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this abrogation was accomplished <b>with a lamb? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The word <b>“silver” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a woman’s firstborn son <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And their redemption money…shall be, according to your valuation, five shekels of silver” (Numbers 18:16). <b>And</b> in addition, the word <b>“lamb” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And every firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13). |
| Exodus 13:13 | firstborn of a donkey | Bekhorot 5b:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A cow that gave birth to a donkey of sorts and a donkey that gave birth to a horse of sorts are exempt from</b> their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn, as it is stated:</b> “And every <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13); “and the <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 34:20). The Torah states this <i>halakha</i> <b>twice,</b> indicating that one is not obligated <b>unless</b> both <b>the birth mother is a donkey and the</b> animal <b>born is a donkey.</b> |
| Exodus 13:13 | “Firstborn of a donkey” | Bekhorot 6a:1 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the phrase: <b>“Firstborn of a donkey”</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>“firstborn of a donkey”</b> (Exodus 34:20), mentioning it a total of <b>two times.</b> The additional usage of the term indicates <b>I said to you</b> that firstborn status applies only to <b>firstborns of donkeys, but not</b> to <b>firstborns of horses or camels.</b> |
| Exodus 13:13 | neck | Bekhorot 9b:19 | § <b>Rabba says: And Rabbi Shimon concedes that</b> even if it is permitted to derive benefit from a firstborn donkey that was not redeemed, <b>following</b> the <b>breaking</b> of its <b>neck</b> in fulfillment of the verse: “And you shall redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13), <b>it is forbidden</b> to derive benefit from its carcass. |
| Exodus 13:13 | with a ben pekua ? | Chullin 74b:10 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to redeeming</b> a firstborn donkey <b>with a <i>ben pekua</i>?</b> Can one perform the mitzva, as stated in the Torah: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13), with this animal? The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir do not raise the dilemma, as, since he says</b> a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>requires slaughter,</b> evidently <b>it is a full-fledged lamb,</b> and therefore it can certainly be used to redeem a donkey. |
| Exodus 13:13 | “lamb” | Chullin 74b:13 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: What</b> is the reason for <b>your opinion?</b> Is it <b>because you derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of redeeming a firstborn donkey <b>from Paschal offerings</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13) written concerning a firstborn donkey and <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:5) written concerning a Paschal offering, and a <i>ben pekua</i> is unfit for sacrifice as a Paschal offering? |
| Exodus 13:13 | redeem” | Chullin 74b:14 | <b>If</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, it must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year, so too here,</b> the lamb must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> Yet the mishna in <i>Bekhorot</i> (9a) states explicitly that one may redeem with a female lamb, and even if it is blemished, and also with one that is past its first year. Mar Zutra responded: The repetition of the words <b>“You shall redeem,” “You shall</b> not <b>redeem”</b> written in the verse: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you shall not redeem it then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13), <b>included</b> a lamb that does not fulfill these criteria. |
| Exodus 13:13 | and a firstborn donkey | Temurah 28a:11 | <b>And</b> in addition, <b>the</b> shaved-off <b>hair of a nazirite</b> (Numbers 6:18); <b>and a firstborn donkey</b> (Exodus 13:13); <b>and meat</b> that was cooked <b>in milk</b> (Exodus 23:19; 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned; and a heifer whose neck is broken</b> as part of the ritual performed when a murder victim’s body is found outside a town, and it is not known who caused his death (Deuteronomy 21:1–9); <b>and non-sacred</b> meat from an animal <b>that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard, and the scapegoat</b> of Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:7–10), all of <b>these</b> are <b>prohibited</b> in themselves <b>and they deem</b> mixtures <b>prohibited in any amount.</b> |
| Exodus 13:13 | “lamb” | Yoma 49b:7 | <b>Mar Zutra raised an objection: And one may not redeem</b> a male firstborn donkey <b>with a calf, nor with an undomesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered</b> lamb, <b>nor with an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], nor with</b> the product of the prohibited <b>crossbreeding</b> of a lamb and a goat, <b>nor with a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both a domesticated animal and a non-domesticated animal, <b>but with a lamb.</b> This proves that a slaughtered animal is not considered a lamb. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>It is different there, as</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy of <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13) and <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:4) <b>from the Paschal offering:</b> Just as a slaughtered lamb cannot be used for a Paschal offering, the same applies to the case of a firstborn donkey. |
| Exodus 13:13 | the verse states: | Yoma 49b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> the Paschal offering must be <b>male, unblemished, and a year old, so too here,</b> for the redemption of a firstborn donkey, one should be obligated to use <b>a male</b> that is <b>unblemished and a year old.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states:</b> “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you shall not redeem it, then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13). The repetition of: <b>“You shall redeem,” “you shall</b> not <b>redeem,”</b> serves to <b>amplify</b> the definition of the offering and include other animals as acceptable for this redemption, not merely those fit for the Paschal offering. |
| Exodus 13:15 | slew [ vayaharog ] | Menachot 29b:2 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rami bar Tamrei, who</b> was <b>the father-in-law of Rami bar Dikkulei,</b> had the <b>leg of</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the term: <b>“And</b> the Lord <b>slew [<i>vayaharog</i>]</b> all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:15), written in his phylacteries, <b>severed by a perforation. He came before Rabbi Zeira</b> to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Go bring a child who is neither wise nor stupid,</b> but of average intelligence; <b>if he reads</b> the term as <b>“And</b> the Lord <b>slew [<i>vayaharog</i>]”</b> then it is <b>fit,</b> as despite the perforation the letter is still seen as a <i>vav</i>. But <b>if not,</b> then it is as though the term <b>were: Will be slain [<i>yehareg</i>],</b> written without the letter <i>vav</i>, <b>and</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> |
| Exodus 13:15 | “opens the womb” | Niddah 40a:14 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that childbirth by caesarean section has the halakhic status of regular childbirth, <b>concedes in</b> the case of <b>consecrated</b> animals <b>that</b> if one attempts to consecrate an animal born by caesarean section, it <b>is not consecrated. What is the reason</b> for this opinion? <b>He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>birth</b> that is written with regard to consecrated animals (see Leviticus 22:27), and the word <b>birth</b> that is written in connection with a <b>firstborn</b> animal (see Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the firstborn, the <i>halakhot</i> apply specifically to one who <b>“opens the womb”</b> (Exodus 13:15), <b>so too here,</b> in the case of consecrated animals, the <i>halakhot</i> apply only to one who <b>opens the womb.</b> |
| Exodus 13:16 | for totafot | Menachot 34b:1 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the phylacteries of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18), this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a manner that must be plural. <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here,</b> as the third one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the phylacteries of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Exodus 13:16 | your arm [ yadkha ]” | Menachot 37a:3 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The requirement that phylacteries be donned on the left arm is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “It shall be for a sign upon <b>your arm [<i>yadkha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 13:16), which <b>is written with</b> a letter <b><i>heh</i></b> at the end. This is expounded as though it stated: Your <b>weak [<i>keha</i>]</b> arm. <b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <i>yadkha</i> should be interpreted as <i>yadko’aḥ</i>, with a letter <i>ḥet</i> at the end instead of a <i>heh</i>. If so, this would mean: <b>Your arm that is of strength [<i>shebeko’aḥ</i>],</b> which is the right arm. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Is</b> this word <b>written with a <i>ḥet</i>?</b> |
| Exodus 13:16 | for totafot | Sanhedrin 4b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does everyone</b> actually hold that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the phylacteries of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a second <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (11:18), this time spelled plene, with a second <i>vav</i>, in a manner that must be plural? <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here,</b> as the third one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the phylacteries of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Exodus 13:16 | written: | Shabbat 132a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> what you say is <b>so, phylacteries, with regard to which</b> the term <b>sign is</b> also <b>written:</b> “And it shall be for a sign on your hand and for frontlets between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), <b>should</b> also <b>override Shabbat,</b> and they should be donned on that day. |
| Exodus 13:16 | for frontlets [ totafot ] | Zevachim 37b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that this is the proper manner of expounding the verses, consider the case of the phylacteries of the head, about which it is stated: “And <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), and: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and subsequently: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18). The word <i>totafot</i> is written once in plene form, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, and twice in a deficient form, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, indicating the singular. Accordingly, <b>there are four</b> frontlets <b>here,</b> and from here the Sages derive that the phylacteries of the head consist of four compartments, which together form a cube. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text,</b> read in the plural, <b>is effective,</b> i.e., that it requires six compartments, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text,</b> read in the singular, <b>is effective,</b> i.e., it requires four compartments, and therefore one should be <b>required to prepare five compartments</b> for the phylacteries of the head? |
| Exodus 13:19 | as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him” | Nazir 45a:2 | Abaye continues: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kelim</i> 1:8) that one who is <b>impure</b> due to contact with <b>a corpse is permitted to enter the Levite camp; and not only one impure</b> from <b>a corpse, but even a corpse itself</b> may be brought inside the Levite camp, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19). The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“with him”?</b> The phrase <b>“with him”</b> indicates that Joseph’s bones were taken <b>within</b> Moses’s <b>boundary, with him in the Levite camp.</b> This demonstrates that even a corpse may be brought into the Levite camp. If so, certainly a nazirite who was impure from contact with a corpse and who has been sprinkled and immersed may enter there. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> that a nazirite must wait until the eighth day to sacrifice his offerings cannot be due to a prohibition against entering the Gate of Nicanor. One can similarly infer that the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>zav</i> who has immersed may not bring his offerings before the eighth day is not because he is prohibited from entering the Gate of Nicanor. |
| Exodus 13:19 | as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him” | Pesachim 67a:10 | <b>And not only did they say that one who is ritually impure due to a corpse</b> may enter this area, <b>but even a corpse itself</b> may be brought into the Levite camp, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19), the words <b>“with him”</b> implying that the bones were taken <b>within his boundary,</b> i.e., that Joseph’s coffin was found in the same area in which Moses dwelled. Since Moses was a Levite and lived in the Levite camp, it follows that even a corpse may be brought into the Levite camp. In any event, we see from the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that a leper does in fact receive lashes for entering an area prohibited to him, against Rav Ḥisda. |
| Exodus 13:19 | it is written: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him” | Sotah 13b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>The verses contradict each other,</b> as <b>it is written: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19), <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up</b> out of Egypt” (Joshua 24:32). Who in fact took Joseph’s bones? |
| Exodus 13:19 | as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him” | Sotah 20b:11 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse is permitted to enter the Levite camp. And</b> the Sages <b>said</b> this <b>not only</b> with regard to <b>one who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse; rather, even a corpse itself</b> may be brought into the Levite camp, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19), which is interpreted to mean: <b>With him, in his vicinity,</b> even though Moses was in the Levite camp. |
| Exodus 13:19 | and there was none among the Jewish people greater than he, as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him” | Sotah 9b:10 | <b>Moses merited</b> to be the only person involved <b>in</b> the transportation of <b>Joseph’s bones</b> to be buried in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and there was none among the Jewish people greater than he, as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19). <b>Who</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses, as no one involved himself in his</b> burial <b>other than the Omnipresent</b> Himself, <b>as it is stated: “And He buried him in the valley</b> in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; and no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). The mishna comments: <b>Not only with regard to Moses did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that God takes part in his burial, <b>but</b> also <b>with regard to all the righteous individuals, as it is stated: “Your righteousness shall go before you and the glory of the Lord shall gather you in”</b> (Isaiah 58:8). |
| Exodus 13:21 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, holds a torch before the Jewish people, as it is written: “And the Lord went before them by day | Avodah Zarah11a:3 | <b>When they were walking,</b> Onkelos <b>said to</b> the troop of soldiers: <b>I will say a mere statement to you: A minor official [<i>nifyora</i>] holds a torch before a high official [<i>apifyora</i>], the high official</b> holds a torch <b>for a duke [<i>dukasa</i>], a duke for the governor,</b> and <b>the governor for the ruler [<i>koma</i>]. Does the ruler hold a torch before</b> the common <b>people?</b> The soldiers <b>said to</b> Onkelos: <b>No.</b> Onkelos <b>said to them:</b> Yet <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, holds a torch before the Jewish people, as it is written: “And the Lord went before them by day</b> in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light” (Exodus 13:21). <b>They all converted.</b> |
| Exodus 13:21 | “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light” | Bava Kamma92b:17 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: When we were small,</b> we were considered <b>to</b> be <b>men; now that we are old,</b> we are considered <b>to</b> be <b>children [<i>ledardekei</i>]?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is that <b>initially, it is written</b> with regard to the Jewish people traveling in the wilderness: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light”</b> (Exodus 13:21). God Himself guarded over the Jewish people. <b>But at the end,</b> after some time passed and it would be expected that the Jewish people were considered more important, <b>it is written:</b> |
| Exodus 13:21 | “And the Lord went before them by day” | Bava Metzia86b:13 | With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he stood by them under the tree,</b> and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: <b>“Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock</b> in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: <b>“And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way”</b> (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). |
| Exodus 13:21 | a rabbi who forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone, as it is stated: “And the Lord went before them by day” | Kiddushin 32a:16 | <b>And Rav Yosef says: Even</b> with regard to <b>a rabbi who forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone, as it is stated: “And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). God Himself, the Teacher of the Jewish people, had forgone the honor due Him and took the trouble to guide the people. <b>Rava said: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, the world is His and the Torah is His,</b> and therefore He can <b>forgo His honor.</b> |
| Exodus 13:21 | that they might go by day and by night” | Menachot 95a:17 | The Gemara challenges: It is <b>obvious</b> that the Tabernacle could be dismantled at night, as it <b>is written:</b> “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; <b>that they might go by day and by night”</b> (Exodus 13:21). The Gemara answers that Abaye’s observation is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that they would travel at night, applies only in a case <b>where</b> the Jewish people <b>dismantled</b> their camp and began to journey <b>by day,</b> in which case they would continue to travel at night. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where they did not dismantle</b> their camp <b>by day they could not dismantle</b> the camp and leave <b>at night.</b> Abaye therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they could set out even at night. |
| Exodus 14:7 | their | Arakhin 15a:17 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the ministering angel of the sea: Spew out</b> the dead Egyptians <b>onto dry land.</b> The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant whose master gives him a gift and then takes it from him?</b> Since the dead Egyptians were given to me for my fish to eat, how can You retract Your gift? God <b>said to</b> the sea: <b>I will give you one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number. Although I am taking them back now, later I will give you one and a half times as many people. In the case of the Egyptians it is stated: “Six hundred chosen chariots” (Exodus 14:7), whereas with regard to Sisera, who was defeated at the Kishon Brook, it is written: “Nine hundred chariots of iron” (Judges 4:13). |
| Exodus 14:7 | While, with regard to Pharaoh, it is written: “Six hundred chosen chariots” | Pesachim 118b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number? How was God’s promise fulfilled? The Gemara answers: <b>While, with regard to Pharaoh, it is written: “Six hundred chosen chariots”</b> (Exodus 14:7), <b>whereas, with regard to Sisera, it is written: “Nine hundred iron chariots”</b> (Judges 4:13). |
| Exodus 14:11 | Because there were no graves in Egypt, | Arakhin 15a:15 | The Gemara lists the ten trials in detail. <b>Two at the sea: One when</b> the Jews <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>and one when</b> they <b>ascended</b> from the sea. The Jews tried God <b>when</b> they <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>as it is written:</b> “And they said to Moses: <b>Because there were no graves in Egypt,</b> have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to take us out of Egypt” (Exodus 14:11). |
| Exodus 14:20 | that which is written: “And the one came not near the other all the night” | Megillah 10b:26 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>The ministering angels wanted to sing</b> their <b>song,</b> for the angels would sing songs to each other, as it states: “And they called out to each other and said” (Isaiah 6:3), but <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The work of My hands,</b> the Egyptians, are <b>drowning at sea, and you</b> wish to <b>say songs?</b> This indicates that God does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked. |
| Exodus 14:20 | “And the one came not near the other all the night” | Sanhedrin 39b:5 | The Gemara comments: <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the passage describing the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>At that time the ministering angels desired to recite a song before the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: My handiwork,</b> i.e., the Egyptians, <b>are drowning in the sea, and you are reciting a song before Me?</b> Apparently, God is not gladdened by the downfall of the wicked. |
| Exodus 14:22 | as it is stated: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground | Berakhot 54a:15 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted,</b> the miracles at <b>the crossings of the sea</b> are recorded explicitly in the Torah, <b>as it is stated: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground</b> and the water was a wall for them on their right and on their left” (Exodus 14:22). So too, the miracle at <b>the crossings of the Jordan, as it is stated: “The priests who bore the ark of God’s covenant stood on dry land within the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry land until the entire nation finished crossing the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 3:17). |
| Exodus 14:22 | “And the children of Israel went into the sea | Yoma 4b:10 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> There is a verbal analogy that resolves this contradiction. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And Moses came <b>into</b> the cloud,” <b>and it is stated below,</b> in another verse: <b>“And the children of Israel went into the sea</b> on dry land” (Exodus 14:22); <b>Just as below,</b> there was <b>a path</b> within the sea, <b>as it is written: “And the water was a wall for them”</b> (Exodus 14:22), <b>here too,</b> there was <b>a path</b> through the cloud, but Moses did not actually enter the cloud. |
| Exodus 14:27 | The Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself exacted retribution from him, as it is written: “And the Lord overthrew Egypt in the midst of the sea” | Sanhedrin 94b:2 | <b>Pharaoh</b> blasphemed God, <b>as it is written</b> that he said to Moses and Aaron: <b>“Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice?”</b> (Exodus 5:2) <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself exacted retribution from him, as it is written: “And the Lord overthrew Egypt in the midst of the sea”</b> (Exodus 14:27), <b>and it is written: “You have trodden through the sea with Your horses”</b> (Habakkuk 3:15). <b>Sennacherib</b> blasphemed God by means of an agent, <b>as it is written: “By your messengers you have taunted the Lord”</b> (II Kings 19:23). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, exacted retribution from him by means of an agent, as it is written: “Then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand”</b> (II Kings 19:35). |
| Exodus 14:27 | and the Egyptians fled toward it; | Sotah 11a:11 | <b>Alternatively,</b> there is an additional way to punish the Egyptians with water: <b>He does not bring</b> a flood upon them, <b>but they</b> may <b>come and fall into</b> water, <b>and so it says:</b> “And the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; <b>and the Egyptians fled toward it;</b> and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27), indicating that the Egyptians fell into the water. <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar says: What is the</b> meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, <b>for in that which they conspired [<i>zadu</i>] against them”</b> (Exodus 18:11)? The phrase means: <b>In the pot in which they cooked, they</b> themselves <b>were cooked,</b> as they were punished through drowning, measure for measure, for drowning the Jewish babies. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“<i>zadu</i>” is a term</b> meaning <b>a pot?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob simmered a pot [<i>vayyazed Ya’akov nazid</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:29). |
| Exodus 14:30 | As it is written: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon | Arakhin 15a:18 | The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant who issues a claim against his master</b> for a gift promised to him? Who will be the guarantor? God <b>said to</b> the ministering angel: <b>The Kishon Brook will be a guarantor</b> for Me. <b>Immediately,</b> the sea <b>spewed</b> the Egyptians <b>out onto the land,</b> and the Jewish people came and saw that they were dead. <b>As it is written: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon</b> the seashore” (Exodus 14:30). |
| Exodus 14:30 | As it is stated: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore” | Pesachim 118b:4 | <b>He said to him: Master of the Universe, can a servant issue a claim against his master</b> for a gift promised to him? Who will be my guarantor? <b>He said to him: The Kishon River will be a guarantor for Me. Immediately,</b> the sea <b>spewed them out onto the land, and the Jewish people came and saw</b> that <b>they</b> were dead. <b>As it is stated: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore”</b> (Exodus 14:30). |
| Exodus 14:31 | Egyptians” | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Exodus 14:31 | strike them? Rabbi Eliezer says: He struck them by hand, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great hand” | Sanhedrin 95b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> did the angel <b>strike them? Rabbi Eliezer says: He struck them by hand, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great hand”</b> (Exodus 14:31), where the term for hand, <i>yad</i>, is preceded by the definite article <i>ha</i>, indicating that this was <b>the hand that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He struck them with</b> His <b>finger, as it is stated: “And the sorcerers said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God”</b> (Exodus 8:15), <b>indicating</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>finger that was destined to exact retribution from Sennacherib. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Gabriel:</b> Is <b>your scythe honed?</b> Gabriel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, it is standing honed from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “For they have fled from the swords,</b> from the honed sword” (Isaiah 21:15). |
| Exodus 15:1 | “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel | Avodah Zarah24b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what song did they recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> They recited the song that follows the verse: <b>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</b> this song unto the Lord” (Exodus 15:1). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says</b> that it was: <b>“And on that day shall you say: Give thanks unto the Lord, proclaim His name,</b> declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted” (Isaiah 12:4). |
| Exodus 15:1 | which is written: “I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted” | Chagigah 13b:5 | § <b>Rava said: All that Ezekiel saw,</b> the prophet <b>Isaiah saw</b> as well, but the latter did not find it necessary to describe his vision in such detail. <b>To what may Ezekiel be compared? To a villager who saw the king</b> and is excited by all the extravagances of the king’s palace and everything it contains, as he is unaccustomed to them. <b>And to what may Isaiah be compared? To a city dweller who saw the king.</b> Such an individual focuses on the encounter with the king, and is oblivious to all the distractions. <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1)? It is fitting to <b>sing to He Who is exalted above the exalted. As the Master said: The king of the beasts</b> is <b>the lion, the king of the domestic animals</b> is <b>the ox, the king of the birds</b> is <b>the eagle, and man is exalted</b> and lords <b>over them, but the Holy One, Blessed be He, is exalted above all of them and above the entire world,</b> as the creatures that appear in the Divine Chariot are the ox, the lion, the eagle, and man. |
| Exodus 15:1 | recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Then sang | Rosh Hashanah31a:11 | The Gemara asks another question: When it came <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon offering on Shabbat, what would</b> the Levites <b>recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Then sang</b> Moses” (Exodus 15:1), <b>and: “Who is like You”</b> (Exodus 15:11), the two halves of the Song of the Sea, <b>and: “Then Israel sang</b> this song” (Numbers 21:17), the entire Song of the Well. |
| Exodus 15:1 | as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel will sing this song to the Lord” | Sanhedrin 91b:14 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: From where</b> is <b>resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel will sing this song to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:1). It <b>is not stated: Sang,</b> in the verse; <b>rather,</b> the term <b>“they will sing”</b> is stated, indicating that Moses will come back to life and sing the song in the future. <b>From here</b> it is proved that <b>resurrection of the dead</b> is derived <b>from the Torah. On a similar note, you</b> can <b>say: “Then Joshua will build an altar to the Lord</b> God of Israel on Mount Ebal” (Joshua 8:30). It <b>is not stated: Built,</b> in the verse; <b>rather,</b> the term <b>“will build”</b> is stated. <b>From here, resurrection of the dead</b> is derived <b>from the Torah.</b> |
| Exodus 15:1 | “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said, saying” | Sotah 27b:11 | Additionally, <b>on that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verse: <b>“Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said, saying”</b> (Exodus 15:1), as follows: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the word <b>“saying,”</b> because it states the word “said” immediately prior to it, <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“saying”? It teaches that the Jewish people would repeat in song after Moses every single statement</b> he said, <b>as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>hallel</i>.</b> After Moses would recite a verse, they would say as a refrain: <b>“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1). It is <b>for this</b> reason that the word <b>“saying” is stated,</b> in addition to the word “said.” |
| Exodus 15:1 | Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord” | Sotah 30b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught: On that same day Rabbi Akiva taught</b> that <b>at the time that the Jewish people ascended from the</b> split <b>sea they set their eyes on reciting a song</b> of gratitude to God. <b>And how did they recite</b> the <b>song?</b> In the same manner <b>as an adult man reciting <i>hallel</i></b> on behalf of a congregation, as his reading enables all who hear to fulfill their obligation, <b>and</b> the congregation listening merely <b>recite after him the chapter headings</b> of <i>hallel</i>. So too, by the sea, <b>Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and</b> the people <b>said</b> after Moses: <b>“I will sing unto the Lord.” Moses</b> continued and <b>said: “For He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and they said</b> once again the chapter heading: <b>“I will sing unto the Lord.”</b> |
| Exodus 15:1 | Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord” | Sotah 30b:12 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says:</b> The Jewish people sang just <b>like a minor boy reciting <i>hallel</i> and</b> the congregation who hear him <b>repeat after him all that he says,</b> word for word, as hearing the recital of a minor is insufficient for fulfilling one’s obligation. So too, by the sea, <b>Moses said: “I will sing unto the Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:1), <b>and</b> the people <b>said</b> after Moses: <b>“I will sing to the Lord.” Moses said: “For He is highly exalted,” and they said</b> after him the same words: <b>“For He is highly exalted.”</b> |
| Exodus 15:1 | With regard to what do they disagree? | Sotah 30b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of the verse: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto the Lord, and said, saying” (Exodus 15:1). <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the word <b>“saying,”</b> which indicates that the people sang after Moses, is referring only <b>to the first words</b> of the song, which the people continually repeated: “I will sing unto the Lord” (Exodus 15:1). |
| Exodus 15:1 | “and they said” | Sotah 30b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, holds</b> that the word <b>“saying”</b> is referring <b>to every single word,</b> as they would repeat after Moses every word. <b>And Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the phrase <b>“and they said”</b> (Exodus 15:1) indicates <b>that everyone recited</b> the song of the sea <b>together,</b> and the word <b>“saying”</b> means <b>that Moses began</b> singing the song <b>first;</b> and then the rest of the people sang the beginning after him and they all continued in unison. |
| Exodus 15:2 | and it is written there: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” | Bava Batra16b:14 | The Gemara cites proofs to support these charges. <b>He engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed maiden,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And Esau came in from the field”; and it is written there</b> with regard to rape of a betrothed maiden: <b>“For he found her in a field”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:27). <b>He killed a person,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “And he was <b>faint”; and it is written there: “Woe is me, for my soul faints before the slayers”</b> (Jeremiah 4:31). <b>And he denied the principle</b> of God’s existence, as <b>it is written here: “What profit is this to me”</b> (Genesis 25:32); <b>and it is written there: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). When he questioned the profit of “this,” he was challenging the assertion that “this is my God.” <b>And he denied resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “Behold, I am at the point of death”</b> (Genesis 25:32), indicating that he did not believe in resurrection after death. <b>And he despised the birthright, as it is written: “And Esau despised the birthright”</b> (Genesis 25:34). |
| Exodus 15:2 | “This is my God, and I will glorify Him” | Gittin 20a:6 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Perhaps</b> that <b>is not so,</b> and <b>the Rabbis say only there,</b> in the case of a Torah scroll, that one may not write the name of God in this manner, <b>because it is required</b> that one perform anything sacred, including the writing of a Torah scroll, in accordance with the verse: <b>“This is my God, and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). This verse requires that mitzvot be performed in a way that is glorious and aesthetically pleasing, <b>and</b> rewriting in this manner is <b>not</b> considered beautiful. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, there is <b>no</b> requirement that the bill of divorce be written beautifully, and therefore writing over the bill of divorce is acceptable according to the Rabbis as well. |
| Exodus 15:2 | “This is my God and I will beautify Him” | Menachot 27a:28 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And what mitzva</b> is one fulfilling? The mitzva is <b>due to</b> the fact that it is stated: <b>“This is my God and I will beautify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2), which is interpreted to mean that one should beautify himself before God in the performance of the mitzvot. The Rabbis agree that although failure to bind the three species does not render them unfit for performing the mitzva, the performance of the mitzva is more beautiful when the <i>lulav</i> is bound. |
| Exodus 15:2 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” | Menachot 53b:4 | Rabbi Ezra stated yet another homily structured in a similar manner. <b>Let this one come and receive this from this One for this people.</b> He explained: <b>Let this one come; this is</b> referring to <b>Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“For as for this Moses, the man</b> who brought us up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:1). <b>And receive this; this is</b> referring to the <b>Torah, as it is written: “And this is the Torah which Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44). <b>From this One; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>For this people; these</b> people <b>are the Jews, as it is stated</b> about them: <b>“This people that You have gotten”</b> (Exodus 15:16). |
| Exodus 15:2 | “This is my God and I will glorify Him [ anvehu ]” | Nazir 2b:8 | § The mishna taught that if one says: <b>I will be beautiful [<i>na’e</i>],</b> he is <b>a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> when he said: I will be beautiful, he meant: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>anvehu</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <i>Anvehu</i> has the same root as the word <i>na’e</i>; therefore, the verse means: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot.</b> How is this done? <b>I will make before Him a beautiful <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful <i>lulav</i>, beautiful ritual fringes. I will write before Him a beautiful Torah scroll, and I will wrap it in beautiful silk cloths [<i>shira’in</i>].</b> |
| Exodus 15:2 | “This is my God and I will glorify Him” | Sanhedrin 42a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who blesses the</b> new <b>month in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> it is <b>as if he greets the Face of the Divine Presence.</b> Alluding to this, it <b>is written here</b> concerning the sanctification of the new month: <b>“This month</b> shall be for you the beginning of months” (Exodus 12:2), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there,</b> where the Jewish people encountered the Divine Presence at the splitting of the sea: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). The term “this” is employed in both verses. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If the Jewish people merited to greet the Face of their Father in Heaven only</b> one time <b>each and every month,</b> it would <b>suffice for them,</b> since in the blessing of the moon there is an aspect of greeting the Divine Presence. <b>Abaye said: Therefore, we will say</b> the blessing <b>while standing,</b> in honor of the Divine Presence. |
| Exodus 15:2 | “This is my God and I will glorify Him” | Shabbat 133b:4 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>From where</b> do you draw this comparison? Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, only stated</b> his opinion that one may do no more than the minimum requirement <b>there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>because we do not need</b> to fulfill the mitzva of: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). The manner in which the animal is flayed does not impact the mitzva of the sacrifice. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to circumcision, <b>where we need</b> to fulfill the mitzva of: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him,”</b> which requires performing the circumcision in a beautiful manner, <b>indeed,</b> Rabbi Yishmael would agree that the mitzva must be performed as aesthetically as possible. |
| Exodus 15:2 | recognized Him first, as it is stated: “This is my God, and I will glorify Him” | Sotah 11b:10 | <b>And when the Holy One, Blessed be He, revealed Himself at the</b> Red <b>Sea,</b> these children <b>recognized Him first, as it is stated: “This is my God, and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). They recognized Him from the previous time that He revealed Himself to them in their infancy, enabling them to say: “This is my God.” |
| Exodus 15:2 | nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” | Sotah 30b:16 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: At the time that the Jewish people ascended from the sea they resolved to sing</b> a song of gratitude to God. <b>And how did they recite</b> this song? If <b>a baby</b> was <b>lying on his mother’s lap or an infant</b> was <b>nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>As it is stated: “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength”</b> (Psalms 8:3). |
| Exodus 15:2 | that it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [ ve’anvehu ]” | Sukkah 11b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>a mitzva to bind the</b> myrtle and the willow with the <b><i>lulav</i>. And if he did not bind it, it is fit. If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, when one did not bind it, why is it fit? If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, why</b> is there <b>a mitzva</b> to bind it at all? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And</b> the reason that there is a mitzva to bind it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>ve’anvehu</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:2), which they interpreted to mean: <b>Beautify yourself [<i>hitna’e</i>] before Him in</b> the performance of the <b>mitzvot.</b> The Rabbis agree that although failure to bind the three species does not render them unfit for the mitzva, the performance of the mitzva is more beautiful when the <i>lulav</i> is bound. |
| Exodus 15:2 | that it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [ ve’anvehu ]” | Sukkah 33a:15 | On a related note, the Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>a mitzva to bind the</b> myrtle and the willow with the <b><i>lulav</i>, and if he did not bind it, it is fit? Whose</b> opinion is it? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, when he did not bind it, why is it fit? If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what mitzva did he perform?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And</b> the reason that there is a mitzva to bind them is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>ve’anvehu</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:2), which they interpreted to mean: Beautify yourself [<i>hitna’e</i>] before Him in the performance of the mitzvot. The Rabbis agree that although failure to bind the three species does not render the <i>lulav</i> unfit for the mitzva, the performance of the mitzva is more beautiful when the <i>lulav</i> is bound. |
| Exodus 15:3 | as it is stated: “The Lord is a man of war” | Avodah Zarah2b:9 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: Everything that you did, you did for your own needs.

| Exodus 15:3 | but the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is a man of war, The Lord is His name” | Sanhedrin 93a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I saw the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle bushes that were in the depths”</b> (Zechariah 1:8)? <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“I saw the night”? The Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to transform the entire world into night</b> and destroy it, as there were no righteous people. <b>“And behold, a man riding”;</b> the word <b>“man”</b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is a man of war, The Lord is His name”</b> (Exodus 15:3). <b>“Upon a red horse”</b> alludes to the fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to transform the whole world into blood.</b> |
| Exodus 15:3 | but the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is an ish of war” | Sanhedrin 96b:11 | Ammon and Moab <b>sent to him</b> that it is written: <b>“For the <i>ish</i> is not at home; he is gone on a long journey”</b> (Proverbs 7:19), <b>and <i>ish</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is an <i>ish</i> of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). Nebuchadnezzar <b>sent to them</b> in response: <b>He is in a nearby</b> location, <b>and He will come.</b> They <b>sent to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“He has gone on a journey from afar”</b> (Proverbs 7:19). Nebuchadnezzar <b>said to them: They have righteous</b> among them <b>who will pray for mercy and bring Him</b> to return. |
| Exodus 15:3 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is a man [ ish ] of war” | Sotah 42b:2 | The mishna recorded the particulars of the priest’s address: <b>The Philistines came championed by Goliath.</b> The Gemara describes the battle between David and Goliath. What is implied by the name <b>Goliath? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse indicates <b>that he stood before the Holy One, Blessed be He, with brazenness [<i>gilui panim</i>], as it is stated: “Choose yourselves a man [<i>ish</i>], and let him come down to me”</b> (I Samuel 17:8), and <b>man [<i>ish</i>]</b> is referring to <b>none other</b> than <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is a man [<i>ish</i>] of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I will hereby fell him by the son of a man [<i>ben ish</i>], as it is stated: “Now David was the son of that man [<i>ben ish</i>] of Ephrath”</b> (I Samuel 17:12). |
| Exodus 15:3 | is stated: “The Lord is a man of war” | Sotah 48a:21 | After listing the sin of those who drink wine with musical accompaniment, the verse states their punishment: <b>What is written afterward? “Therefore, My people have gone into captivity, for want of knowledge”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), meaning <b>that they cause exile to the world; “and their honorable men are famished”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>as they bring famine to the world; “and their multitude are parched with thirst”</b> (Isaiah 5:13), <b>that they cause the Torah,</b> which is compared to water, <b>to be forgotten by those who learn it. “And mankind is bowed down, and man is humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> i.e., God Himself, <b>to be brought down, as “man”</b> in the phrase “and man is humbled” means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as</b> it <b>is stated: “The Lord is a man of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). The verse continues: <b>“And the eyes of the lofty are humbled”</b> (Isaiah 5:15), <b>that they cause the Jewish people to be brought down.</b> These are the five retributions. |
| Exodus 15:6 | written: “Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power” | Avodah Zarah4a:4 | § <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa raises a contradiction</b> between the following verses. <b>It is written: “The Almighty, Whom we have not found out His excellent power”</b> (Job 37:23), which indicates that His power has not been seen. <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Great is our Lord, and mighty in power”</b> (Psalms 147:5), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power”</b> (Exodus 15:6), from which it may be inferred that His power is discernable. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> in the first verse, God’s strength is not seen <b>at a time of judgment,</b> where He acts mercifully, whereas <b>there,</b> in the other verses, they are referring <b>to a time of war,</b> when He wages war against His enemies and His power is seen. |
| Exodus 15:10 | “The mighty [ addirim ] sank as lead in the waters” | Menachot 53a:18 | Rabbi Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>Addir</i> in the phrase: <b>Let the <i>Addir</i> come, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord on high is mighty [<i>addir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4). In the phrase: <b>And exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Jews, as it is stated: “The excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3). In the phrase: <b>From the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the Egyptians, as it is written</b> with regard to the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“The mighty [<i>addirim</i>] sank as lead in the waters”</b> (Exodus 15:10). In the phrase: <b>In the <i>addirim</i>, these</b> <i>addirim</i> <b>are the waters, as it is stated: “Above the voices of many waters, the mighty [<i>addirim</i>] breakers of the sea”</b> (Psalms 93:4). |
| Exodus 15:11 | “Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods [ elim ]” | Gittin 56b:10 | <b>Abba Ḥanan says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Who is strong like You, O Lord?”</b> (Psalms 89:9). <b>Who is strong and indurate like You, as You hear the abuse and the blasphemy of that wicked man and remain silent.</b> Similarly, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the verse: <b>“Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods [<i>elim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:11), should be read as: <b>Who is like You among the mute [<i>ilmim</i>],</b> for You conduct Yourself like a mute and remain silent in the face of Your blasphemers. |
| Exodus 15:11 | and: “Who is like You” | Rosh Hashanah31a:11 | The Gemara asks another question: When it came <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon offering on Shabbat, what would</b> the Levites <b>recite? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Then sang</b> Moses” (Exodus 15:1), <b>and: “Who is like You”</b> (Exodus 15:11), the two halves of the Song of the Sea, <b>and: “Then Israel sang</b> this song” (Numbers 21:17), the entire Song of the Well. |
| Exodus 15:13 | there: “To Your holy habitation [ neveh ]” | Bava Batra98a:8 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who glorifies himself</b> by wearing <b>a garment of</b> the style worn by <b>a Torah scholar, but</b> in reality <b>he is not a Torah scholar, he will not be brought within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> in the World-to-Come. This is alluded to by the fact that it is <b>written</b> in the verse <b>here: “Abides [<i>yinveh</i>] not,” and</b> the meaning of the word <i>yinveh</i> may be derived from that which <b>is written</b> in a verse <b>there: “To Your holy habitation [<i>neveh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:13). |
| Exodus 15:16 | “This people that You have gotten” | Menachot 53b:4 | Rabbi Ezra stated yet another homily structured in a similar manner. <b>Let this one come and receive this from this One for this people.</b> He explained: <b>Let this one come; this is</b> referring to <b>Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“For as for this Moses, the man</b> who brought us up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:1). <b>And receive this; this is</b> referring to the <b>Torah, as it is written: “And this is the Torah which Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44). <b>From this One; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>For this people; these</b> people <b>are the Jews, as it is stated</b> about them: <b>“This people that You have gotten”</b> (Exodus 15:16). |
| Exodus 15:16 | The Jewish people are one acquisition, as it is written: “The nation that You have acquired” | Pesachim 87b:6 | The Gemara proceeds to enumerate all four: <b>Torah is one acquisition, as it is written: “The Lord acquired me as the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). <b>Heaven and earth are one acquisition [<i>kinyan</i>], as it is written:</b> “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, <b>Creator [<i>koneh</i>] of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:19). <b>The Holy Temple is one acquisition, as it is written:</b> “And He brought them to His sacred border, <b>to this mountain, which His right hand had acquired”</b> (Psalms 78:54). <b>The Jewish people are one acquisition, as it is written: “The nation that You have acquired”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>And you,</b> Hosea, <b>said</b> that I should <b>replace them with another nation?</b> |
| Exodus 15:16 | as it is taught | Sanhedrin 98b:6 | Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi explains: <b>He was afraid lest sin</b> on his part <b>cause</b> that assurance to be abrogated, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Until Your people pass over, Lord, until Your people, whom You have acquired, pass over” (Exodus 15:16). <b>“Until Your people pass over, Lord”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the first entry</b> into the land, led by Joshua. <b>“Until Your people, whom You have acquired, pass over”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the second entry</b> into the land, when they returned to Zion from Babylonia. |
| Exodus 15:16 | till Your people pass over, Lord” | Sotah 36a:3 | <b>And</b> similarly, the verse <b>says: “Terror and dread falls upon them;</b> by the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone; <b>till Your people pass over, Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>This</b> alludes to the <b>first arrival</b> of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael, during the period of Joshua. The verse continues: <b>“Till the people that You have gotten pass over”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>This</b> alludes to the <b>second arrival,</b> when the Jews returned to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia after the destruction of the First Temple. |
| Exodus 15:17 | “You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance” | Bava Batra119b:4 | The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> God <b>resolved</b> the question <b>for him:</b> The verse teaches <b>both of them. It</b> is <b>an inheritance for you from your fathers</b> and is considered in your possession; <b>and</b> also the generation that left Egypt <b>bequeath but they do not inherit. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the song that the Jewish people sang after the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance”</b> (Exodus 15:17). It <b>is not stated: You will bring us in, rather: “You will bring them in,”</b> which <b>teaches that</b> in their song, the Jewish people <b>were prophesying</b> that their generation would never enter Eretz Yisrael, <b>but they did not know what they were prophesying.</b> |
| Exodus 15:17 | You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, | Berakhot 33a:20 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Great is the Holy Temple, as</b> it too <b>was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The place in which to dwell which <b>You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord,</b> which Your hands have prepared” (Exodus 15:17). |
| Exodus 15:17 | initially it is written: “You bring them and plant them | Ketubot 62b:9 | The proof for this is that <b>initially it is written: “You bring them and plant them</b> in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place that You, O Lord, have made for You to dwell in” (Exodus 15:17), which indicates that God’s original intention was to build a Temple for the Jewish people after they had entered Eretz Yisrael. <b>And ultimately it is written: “And let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), i.e., even while they were still in the desert, which indicates that due to their closeness to God, they enjoyed greater affection and He therefore advanced what would originally have come later. |
| Exodus 15:17 | You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, which Your hands have prepared” | Sanhedrin 92a:8 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Great is the Holy Temple, as it</b> too <b>was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The place in which to dwell that <b>You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, which Your hands have prepared”</b> (Exodus 15:17). <b>Rav Adda Karḥina’a objects to</b> the explanation that being placed between two names of God accords significance. <b>If that is so,</b> the same should hold true for vengeance. Shall one say: <b>Great</b> is <b>vengeance, as it was placed between two letters, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1)? |
| Exodus 15:18 | Va’ed , as it is written: “The Lord shall reign forever and ever [ va’ed ]” | Eruvin 54a:15 | <b>Selah, as it is written: “As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of Hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it forever, Selah”</b> (Psalms 48:9), which demonstrates that Selah means forever. <b><i>Va’ed</i>, as it is written: “The Lord shall reign forever and ever [<i>va’ed</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:18). |
| Exodus 15:18 | and: “The Lord shall reign for ever and ever” | Rosh Hashanah32b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is possible to conclude <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i></b> with a verse from the Torah, as <b>there are many</b> such verses. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Kingship, there are</b> only <b>three: “The Lord his God is with him, and the sounding of a king is among them”</b> (Numbers 23:21); <b>“And he was king in Jeshurun”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:5); <b>and: “The Lord shall reign for ever and ever”</b> (Exodus 15:18). <b>And we require ten</b> verses, <b>and</b> according to Rabbi Yosei <b>there are not</b> enough, as he maintains that one should recite four verses from the Torah, the first three and the concluding one. |
| Exodus 15:20 | “And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took | Megillah 14a:14 | <b>Miriam</b> was a prophetess, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly: <b>“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took</b> a timbrel in her hand” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Was she the sister only of Aaron, <b>and not the sister of Moses?</b> Why does the verse mention only one of her brothers? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rav said: For she prophesied when she was the sister of Aaron,</b> i.e., she prophesied since her youth, even before Moses was born, <b>and she would say: My mother is destined to bear a son who will deliver the Jewish people</b> to salvation. <b>And at the time when</b> Moses <b>was born the entire house was filled with light,</b> and <b>her father stood and kissed her on the head,</b> and <b>said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled.</b> |
| Exodus 15:20 | “And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took | Sotah 12b:23 | Elsewhere, the verse states with regard to Miriam: <b>“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took</b> a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Why is Miriam referred to as <b>“the sister of Aaron,” and not the sister of Moses? Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Miriam already <b>prophesied when she was</b> still <b>the sister of</b> only <b>Aaron,</b> i.e., before Moses was born. |
| Exodus 15:22 | and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water” | Bava Kamma82a:5 | The Gemara discusses the second of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that they should read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Did Ezra institute</b> this practice? <b>But it was instituted from the beginning,</b> i.e., long before his time. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; <b>and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water”</b> (Exodus 15:22). <b>Those who interpret verses</b> metaphorically <b>said</b> that <b>water</b> here is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated</b> metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1). |
| Exodus 15:23 | in Mara as it is written: “And when they came to Mara, they could not drink | Arakhin 15a:19 | The Gemara continues its list of the Jewish people’s trials of God: <b>Two with water:</b> One <b>in Mara and</b> one <b>in Rephidim.</b> The Jewish people tested God <b>in Mara as it is written: “And when they came to Mara, they could not drink</b> of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Mara” (Exodus 15:23), as Mara means bitter. <b>And it is written: “And the people murmured against Moses,</b> saying: What shall we drink?” (Exodus 15:24). |
| Exodus 15:24 | And it is written: “And the people murmured against Moses, | Arakhin 15a:19 | The Gemara continues its list of the Jewish people’s trials of God: <b>Two with water:</b> One <b>in Mara and</b> one <b>in Rephidim.</b> The Jewish people tested God <b>in Mara as it is written: “And when they came to Mara, they could not drink</b> of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter.

| Exodus 15:25 | “There He made for them a statute and an ordinance” | Sanhedrin 56b:16 | The mitzva of <b>judgment</b> was given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Marah: <b>“There He made for them a statute and an ordinance”</b> (Exodus 15:25). <b>Shabbat and honoring</b> one’s <b>father and mother</b> were given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> concerning them in the Ten Commandments: “Observe the day of Shabbat to keep it holy, <b>as the Lord your God commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:12), and similarly: “Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). The phrase “as the Lord your God commanded you” indicates that they had already been commanded to observe these mitzvot previously. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: “As</b> the Lord your God <b>commanded you” in Marah.</b> Apparently, the mitzva of establishing courts is not included in the seven Noahide mitzvot. |
| Exodus 15:25 | Rav said: As He commanded you in Mara, | Shabbat 87b:1 | the sixth day <b>from their encampment. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The sixth day <b>from</b> the start of <b>their journey.</b> They left Refidim and arrived and camped in the desert on the same Sunday. <b>And</b> Rava and Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>disagree</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>Shabbat</b> commanded to the Jewish people at <b>Mara, as it is written</b> in the fourth commandment: “Observe the Shabbat day to keep it holy <b>as the Lord your God commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:11). <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: As He commanded you in Mara,</b> as it is stated: “There He made for him a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved him” (Exodus 15:25). Their dispute was: One <b>Master held: They were commanded</b> about <b>Shabbat,</b> but <b>they were not commanded</b> about Shabbat <b>boundaries.</b> Therefore, it was permitted to travel from Refidim on Shabbat, because the restriction of Shabbat boundaries was not yet in effect. <b>And</b> one <b>Master held: They were also commanded</b> about the <b>boundaries,</b> and therefore, it was prohibited to leave Refidim on Shabbat. |
| Exodus 15:26 | it is said: “And He said, if you will surely listen [ shamo’a tishma ] | Berakhot 40a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Zeira, and some say Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa, said: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood is</b> that <b>an empty vessel holds</b> that which is placed within it, while <b>a full</b> vessel <b>does not hold</b> it. <b>The attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> however, <b>is not so,</b> as if God adds to a person who is <b>a full vessel</b> in terms of knowledge or good attributes, he will <b>hold</b> it; a person who is <b>an empty</b> vessel <b>will not hold</b> it. This is alluded to by the verse where <b>it is said: “And He said, if you will surely listen [<i>shamo’a tishma</i>]</b> to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in His eyes” (Exodus 15:26). This verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>If you listen [<i>shamo’a</i>]</b> in the present, <b>you will listen [<i>tishma</i>]</b> in the future as well; <b>and if not, you will not listen. Alternatively: If you listened [<i>shamo’a</i>] to the old,</b> you review what you already learned, then <b>you will listen [<i>tishma</i>] to the new</b> as well. But <b>if you turn your heart away, you will no longer be able to hear.</b> |
| Exodus 15:26 | as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren,</b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather,</b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions,</b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.” |
| Exodus 15:26 | as it is written: “If you shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God… | Horayot 8b:1 | that it is derived from the verse: “All that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses, <b>from the day that the Lord commanded and onward throughout your generations”</b> (Numbers 15:23). <b>Which is</b> the <b>mitzva that was stated at the beginning</b> of all the mitzvot? <b>You must say: This is idol worship,</b> as it is the first mitzva in the Ten Commandments. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say: The Jewish people were commanded ten mitzvot in Marah</b> soon after leaving Egypt, prior to the revelation at Sinai, <b>as it is written: “If you shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God…</b>and listen to His mitzvot” (Exodus 15:26)? Evidently, there were mitzvot that preceded the prohibition against idol worship. <b>Rather, it is clear as we initially answered.</b> |
| Exodus 15:26 | It is written: “All the disease that I placed in Egypt I shall not place upon you, for I am the Lord, your Healer” | Sanhedrin 101a:10 | <b>Rabbi Abba said to Rabba bar Mari</b> that there is an apparent contradiction in a verse. <b>It is written: “All the disease that I placed in Egypt I shall not place upon you, for I am the Lord, your Healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>And since</b> God <b>does not place</b> the disease upon the Jewish people, <b>why is healing</b> necessary? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This verse can be interpreted</b> and the contradiction resolved <b>from</b> the contents of the verse <b>itself, as it is stated: “And He said: If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord, your God”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>If you hearken</b> to God’s voice, <b>I will not place</b> the disease upon you, <b>and if you do not hearken</b> to God’s voice, <b>I will place</b> the disease upon you. <b>Nevertheless,</b> even if you do not hearken to the voice of God, and I place the disease upon you, know that I will heal you, <b>“for I am the Lord, your Healer.”</b> |
| Exodus 15:26 | “Every illness that I placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you, for I am the Lord, your Healer” | Sanhedrin 90a:16 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Also</b> included in the exceptions are <b>one who reads external literature, and one who whispers</b> invocations <b>over a wound and says</b> as an invocation for healing: <b>“Every illness that I placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you, for I am the Lord, your Healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). By doing so, he shows contempt for the sanctity of the name of God and therefore has no share in the World-to-Come. <b>Abba Shaul says: Also</b> included in the exceptions is <b>one who pronounces the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God as it is written, <b>with its letters.</b> |
| Exodus 15:27 | “ Elima ” | Yevamot 13b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that with regard to <b>any word that requires</b> the letter <b><i>lamed</i> at its beginning,</b> meaning: To, <b>the verse</b> at times <b>placed</b> a letter <b><i>heh</i> at its end,</b> but the meaning is the same. <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For example,</b> the term: To <b>“Elim”</b> (Exodus 16:1) can be rendered as <b>“<i>Elima</i>”</b> (Exodus 15:27) instead of <i>le’Elim</i>; <b>“Maḥanaim”</b> (I Kings 2:8) becomes <b>“<i>Maḥanaima</i>”</b> (II Samuel 17:24); <b>“<i>Mitzraim</i>”</b> (e.g., Genesis 13:1) into <b>“<i>Mitzraima</i>”</b> (Genesis 12:10); Divlatayim is <b>“<i>Divlataima</i>”</b> (Numbers 33:46); to <i>Yerushalaim</i> is <b>“<i>Yerushalaima</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 8:3); and <b>“<i>midbara</i>”</b> (Joshua 18:12) means: To the wilderness [<i>midbar</i>]. All these words that contain the letter <i>heh</i> at the end mean the same as if there were a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning. |
| Exodus 16:1 | on the fifteenth day of the second month | Shabbat 87b:5 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from another verse, as it is stated: <b>“And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel</b> came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, <b>on the fifteenth day of the second month</b> after their departing out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 16:1). <b>And that day was Shabbat, as it is written: “And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the Lord;</b> for He has heard your murmurings against the Lord; and what are we, that you murmur against us?” (Exodus 16:7). The next day the glory of God was revealed, and He told them that in the afternoon the manna and quail would begin to fall, <b>and it is written: “Six days you shall gather it;</b> but on the seventh day is Sabbath, there shall be none in it” (Exodus 16:26). Apparently, the first six days after this command were weekdays on which the manna fell, and the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>fifteenth of Iyyar</b> was <b>Shabbat,</b> the <b>New Moon</b> of <b>Sivan</b> was on the <b>first</b> day <b>of the week.</b> This is <b>difficult</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara answers: According to the Rabbis, <b>a day was added to Iyyar that year</b> and it was thirty days long. Therefore, the New Moon of Sivan was on Monday. |
| Exodus 16:1 | “Elim” | Yevamot 13b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that with regard to <b>any word that requires</b> the letter <b><i>lamed</i> at its beginning,</b> meaning: To, <b>the verse</b> at times <b>placed</b> a letter <b><i>heh</i> at its end,</b> but the meaning is the same. <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For example,</b> the term: To <b>“Elim”</b> (Exodus 16:1) can be rendered as <b>“<i>Elima</i>”</b> (Exodus 15:27) instead of <i>le’Elim</i>; <b>“Maḥanaim”</b> (I Kings 2:8) becomes <b>“<i>Maḥanaima</i>”</b> (II Samuel 17:24); <b>“<i>Mitzraim</i>”</b> (e.g., Genesis 13:1) into <b>“<i>Mitzraima</i>”</b> (Genesis 12:10); Divlatayim is <b>“<i>Divlataima</i>”</b> (Numbers 33:46); to <i>Yerushalaim</i> is <b>“<i>Yerushalaima</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 8:3); and <b>“<i>midbara</i>”</b> (Joshua 18:12) means: To the wilderness [<i>midbar</i>]. All these words that contain the letter <i>heh</i> at the end mean the same as if there were a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning. |
| Exodus 16:3 | when we sat by the meat pots, | Arakhin 15b:2 | The Gemara continues its elucidation of the <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>two</b> trials relating to the quail, one was <b>on the first</b> occasion when the <b>quail</b> appeared, <b>and</b> the other <b>on the second</b> occasion the <b>quail</b> appeared. The Gemara clarifies: The trial <b>of the first quail</b> is described in the verse: “And the children of Israel said to them: Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, <b>when we sat by the meat pots,</b> when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger” (Exodus 16:3). Immediately afterward the quail arrived, as the verse states: “And it came to pass in the evening, that the quail came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp” (Exodus 16:13). |
| Exodus 16:4 | “Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you” | Bava Metzia86b:12 | The Gemara elaborates: With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And Abraham ran to the herd”</b> (Genesis 18:7), bringing the meat himself, and in reference to God’s actions for Abraham’s descendants the verse states: <b>“And there went forth a wind from the Lord,</b> and brought across quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31), that God brought meat to them. In reference to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he took curd and milk”</b> (Genesis 18:8), and God says to the Jewish people: <b>“Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4), which shows that God gave food to the Jewish people. |
| Exodus 16:4 | for the sake of many, as it is written: “Behold I will cause to rain bread from the heavens for you” | Taanit 9a:8 | § After this brief digression, the Gemara turns to the fifth in the series of statements by Rabbi Yoḥanan concerning rain. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rain</b> falls even <b>for the sake of an individual,</b> in response to the petition of a single person in need of rain, whereas a blessing of <b>sustenance</b> comes only <b>for the sake of many. Rain</b> falls even <b>for the sake of an individual, as it is written: “The Lord will open for you His good treasure,</b> the heavens, <b>to give the rain of your land”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12). The fact that this verse is written in the second person singular demonstrates that rain can fall even for the sake of an individual. Rabbi Yoḥanan further proves that <b>sustenance</b> comes <b>for the sake of many, as it is written: “Behold I will cause to rain bread from the heavens for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4). Here, God is referring to the people in the plural form. |
| Exodus 16:4 | And it is written: “And the people shall go out and gather | Yoma 75a:16 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the manna: <b>It is written: “And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it”</b> (Numbers 11:9). <b>And it is written: “And the people shall go out and gather</b> a day’s portion every day” (Exodus 16:4). <b>And it is written: “The people went about and gathered it”</b> (Numbers 11:8). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? For the <b>righteous,</b> the manna <b>fell at the opening of their homes.</b> They expended no effort at all. The <b>average people went out</b> of the camp <b>and gathered</b> what fell there. <b>The wicked</b> had <b>to go about</b> farther <b>to gather.</b> |
| Exodus 16:4 | it is written “bread” | Yoma 75a:17 | With regard to the manna, <b>it is written “bread”</b> (Exodus 16:4); <b>and it is written “cakes”</b> (Numbers 11:8); <b>and it is</b> also <b>written “and ground it</b> in mills,” (Numbers 11:8), implying that it was neither bread nor a cake. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? For the <b>righteous,</b> it fell as baked <b>bread;</b> for <b>average people,</b> it fell as unbaked <b>cakes;</b> for the <b>wicked</b> it came in an unprocessed form and consequently they <b>ground it</b> in a mill. |
| Exodus 16:4 | it is written “bread” | Yoma 75b:5 | With regard to the manna, <b>it is written “bread”</b> (Exodus 16:4), <b>and it is written “oil”</b> (Numbers 11:8), <b>and it is written “honey”</b> (Exodus 16:31). How can we reconcile these verses? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: For the youth</b> it was like <b>bread, for the elderly</b> it was like <b>oil,</b> and <b>for the children</b> it was like <b>honey.</b> Each received what was appropriate. |
| Exodus 16:5 | “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in” | Beitzah 2b:10 | The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabba,</b> who prohibits one to derive benefit even from something that was not prepared by man, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning. As Rabba said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the manna: <b>“And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5)? According to Rabba, it can be inferred from this verse that on an ordinary <b>weekday,</b> “the sixth day,” <b>one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for Shabbat, and</b> similarly, on an ordinary <b>weekday one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for a Festival.</b> However, on <b>a Festival one may not prepare for Shabbat, and</b> likewise <b>on Shabbat one may not prepare for a Festival.</b> |
| Exodus 16:5 | “And it shall come to pass, on the sixth day, when they shall prepare | Eruvin 38b:11 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse that states: <b>“And it shall come to pass, on the sixth day, when they shall prepare</b> that which they bring in” (Exodus 16:5), indicates as follows: On an ordinary <b>weekday one may prepare</b> what is needed <b>for Shabbat, and</b> similarly, on an ordinary <b>weekday one may prepare</b> what is needed <b>for a Festival.</b> However, on <b>a Festival one may not prepare for Shabbat, and</b> on <b>Shabbat one may not prepare for a Festival.</b> Therefore, an egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited on Shabbat not because they constitute a single sanctity, but because it is prohibited to prepare on one sanctified day for another. |
| Exodus 16:5 | He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in” | Pesachim 47b:10 | The Gemara asks: Is the prohibition against utilizing <b>set-aside</b> material prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, such that a person is flogged for violating this prohibition? <b>He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5). This verse teaches that anything that has not been prepared before the Festival is considered to be set-aside, and it is prohibited to utilize it. This verse indicates that utilizing set-aside objects is prohibited; however, it does not formulate this prohibition as a negative commandment. Therefore, the Gemara adds that <b>the warning</b> indicating that it is a negative commandment <b>is from here: “You shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:10). This general statement pertaining to Shabbat includes utilizing objects that were not set aside for use before Shabbat. |
| Exodus 16:5 | “And it shall be on the sixth day, and they will prepare that which they have brought” | Shabbat 117b:9 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person should always rise early</b> on Friday in order <b>to</b> prepare all of the <b>expenditures for Shabbat, as it is written</b> with regard to the collection of the manna: <b>“And it shall be on the sixth day, and they will prepare that which they have brought”</b> (Exodus 16:5), indicating that the children of Israel would begin preparing the food for Shabbat <b>immediately</b> upon collecting the manna in the morning. Apropos manna, the Gemara mentions other matters derived from it. <b>Rabbi Abba said: On Shabbat a person is obligated to break</b> bread in his meal <b>over two loaves</b> of bread, <b>as it is written:</b> “And it happened on the sixth day, they collected <b>double the bread,</b> two <i>omer</i> for each one” (Exodus 16:22). |
| Exodus 16:7 | “And what are we” | Chullin 89a:6 | <b>I granted greatness to Abraham,</b> yet <b>he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). I granted greatness <b>to Moses and Aaron,</b> yet Moses <b>said</b> of the two of them: <b>“And what are we”</b> (Exodus 16:7). I granted greatness <b>to David,</b> yet <b>he said: “But I am a worm, and no man”</b> (Psalms 22:7). |
| Exodus 16:7 | And that day was Shabbat, as it is written: “And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the Lord; | Shabbat 87b:5 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from another verse, as it is stated: <b>“And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel</b> came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, <b>on the fifteenth day of the second month</b> after their departing out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 16:1). <b>And that day was Shabbat, as it is written: “And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the Lord;</b> for He has heard your murmurings against the Lord; and what are we, that you murmur against us?” (Exodus 16:7). The next day the glory of God was revealed, and He told them that in the afternoon the manna and quail would begin to fall, <b>and it is written: “Six days you shall gather it;</b> but on the seventh day is Sabbath, there shall be none in it” (Exodus 16:26). Apparently, the first six days after this command were weekdays on which the manna fell, and the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>fifteenth of Iyyar</b> was <b>Shabbat,</b> the <b>New Moon</b> of <b>Sivan</b> was on the <b>first</b> day <b>of the week.</b> This is <b>difficult</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara answers: According to the Rabbis, <b>a day was added to Iyyar that year</b> and it was thirty days long. Therefore, the New Moon of Sivan was on Monday. |
| Exodus 16:8 | Lest you say: Since it is written: “When the Lord shall give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to the full” | Berakhot 20b:7 | We also learned in the mishna that women are obligated to recite the <b>Grace after Meals.</b> The Gemara asks: That too is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since it is written: “When the Lord shall give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to the full”</b> (Exodus 16:8), one might conclude that the Torah established fixed times for the meals and, consequently, for the mitzva of Grace after Meals and, therefore, it <b>is considered a time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> exempting women from its recitation. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that women are obligated. |
| Exodus 16:8 | it is as though he is expressing resentment against the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord” | Sanhedrin 110a:10 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: Anyone who expresses resentment against his teacher</b> for wronging him, <b>it is as though he is expressing resentment against the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord”</b> (Exodus 16:8). <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Anyone who suspects his teacher</b> of wrongdoing, <b>it is as though he suspects the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And the people spoke against God, and against Moses”</b> (Numbers 21:5). The verse likens God and Moses with regard to this matter. |
| Exodus 16:8 | “And Moses said: This shall be, when the Lord will give you in the evening meat to eat, and in the morning bread to the full” | Yoma 75a:21 | The verse states: <b>“And Moses said: This shall be, when the Lord will give you in the evening meat to eat, and in the morning bread to the full”</b> (Exodus 16:8). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: The meat that the Jewish people asked for inappropriately,</b> since they had the manna and did not need meat, was <b>given to them inappropriately,</b> in a way that was unpleasant; they were punished afterward (Rabbeinu Elyakim). |
| Exodus 16:8 | to eat meat only at night, | Yoma 75b:1 | However, <b>bread,</b> which is essential, <b>they asked for appropriately.</b> Therefore, it <b>was given to them appropriately,</b> in the morning, when there was time to prepare it. The Gemara comments: <b>From here, the Torah teaches etiquette, that</b> it is proper <b>to eat meat only at night,</b> as Moses said to the children of Israel: “This shall be, when the Lord will give you in the evening meat to eat” (Exodus 16:8). The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Abaye say</b> that <b>someone who has a meal should eat it only in the day?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We mean to say: Like day.</b> It is not necessary to eat the food in the daytime, as long as one can see what he eats. <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: At the beginning, the Jewish people were like chickens pecking at the garbage;</b> any time there was food they grabbed it and ate it, <b>until Moses came and set specific times to eat,</b> as the verse implies. He set mealtimes for them in the morning and in the evening. |
| Exodus 16:14 | “a fine flaky [ meḥuspas ] | Yoma 75b:10 | The verse describes the manna as <b>“a fine flaky [<i>meḥuspas</i>]</b> substance” (Exodus 16:14). <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> <i>Meḥuspas</i> means it was <b>a substance that dissolved [</b><i>maḥ</i><b>] on the palm [</b><i>pas</i><b>] of the hand.</b> Since it was so fine, it dissolved upon contact. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It was a substance that was absorbed in</b> all <b>248 limbs,</b> the numerical equivalent of the word <i>meḥuspas</i>. The Gemara expresses surprise at this: If one calculates the value of the letters in the word <b><i>meḥuspas</i>,</b> it <b>is more,</b> totaling 254. <b>Rabbi Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: <i>Meḥuspas</i> is written</b> in the Torah without the letter <i>vav</i>. Therefore, the total is exactly 248. |
| Exodus 16:14 | it is written: “And when the layer of dew lifted, | Yoma 75b:9 | § Furthermore, with regard to the manna <b>it is written: “And when the layer of dew lifted,</b> behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground” (Exodus 16:14), indicating that the dew covered the manna. <b>And it is written:</b> “<b>And when the dew fell</b> upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it” (Numbers 11:9), meaning that the manna fell on top of the dew. How can these verses be reconciled? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> There was <b>dew above and dew below,</b> with the manna in between, <b>and</b> the manna <b>appeared as if</b> it were <b>placed in a box [<i>kufsa</i>]</b> of dew. |
| Exodus 16:19 | leave any of it | Arakhin 15b:1 | <b>Do not go out,</b> as indicated in the verse: “And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath for the Lord; today you will not find it in the field” (Exodus 16:25). <b>But</b> nevertheless there were people who <b>went out</b> to look for manna, as it is written: “And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none” (Exodus 16:27). The verse also states: “And Moses said to them: Let <b>no</b> man <b>leave any of it</b> until the morning” (Exodus 16:19), <b>and</b> there were people who <b>left it</b> until morning, as it states: “But they did not listen to Moses; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was angry with them” (Exodus 16:20). |
| Exodus 16:20 | left it | Arakhin 15b:1 | <b>Do not go out,</b> as indicated in the verse: “And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath for the Lord; today you will not find it in the field” (Exodus 16:25). <b>But</b> nevertheless there were people who <b>went out</b> to look for manna, as it is written: “And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none” (Exodus 16:27). The verse also states: “And Moses said to them: Let <b>no</b> man <b>leave any of it</b> until the morning” (Exodus 16:19), <b>and</b> there were people who <b>left it</b> until morning, as it states: “But they did not listen to Moses; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was angry with them” (Exodus 16:20). |
| Exodus 16:21 | and when the sun grew hot it melted” | Berakhot 27a:9 | <b>And about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours.</b> Based on this, the Gemara attempts to identify <b>the <i>tanna</i> who taught that which we learned</b> in the mishna about the manna that fell for the children of Israel in the desert: “And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to what he eats, <b>and when the sun grew hot it melted”</b> (Exodus 16:21); that took place <b>four hours</b> into the day. |
| Exodus 16:22 | “Twice as much bread” | Berakhot 39b:9 | In connection to the various <i>halakhot</i> with regard to breaking bread, especially on Festivals, the Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Abba said: And on Shabbat one is obligated to break</b> bread for the meal <b>over two loaves. What is the reason?</b> Because in the Torah portion that discusses gathering manna on Friday for Shabbat, the phrase: <b>“Twice as much bread”</b> (Exodus 16:22) <b>is written.</b> To commemorate this, Shabbat meals are based on two loaves of bread. |
| Exodus 16:22 | double the bread, | Shabbat 117b:9 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person should always rise early</b> on Friday in order <b>to</b> prepare all of the <b>expenditures for Shabbat, as it is written</b> with regard to the collection of the manna: <b>“And it shall be on the sixth day, and they will prepare that which they have brought”</b> (Exodus 16:5), indicating that the children of Israel would begin preparing the food for Shabbat <b>immediately</b> upon collecting the manna in the morning. Apropos manna, the Gemara mentions other matters derived from it. <b>Rabbi Abba said: On Shabbat a person is obligated to break</b> bread in his meal <b>over two loaves</b> of bread, <b>as it is written:</b> “And it happened on the sixth day, they collected <b>double the bread,</b> two <i>omer</i> for each one” (Exodus 16:22). |
| Exodus 16:23 | Bake that which you will bake and cook that which you will cook, | Beitzah 15b:9 | The Gemara comments: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the proof for <i>eiruv tavshilin</i> <b>from here,</b> the following verse: “Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Shabbat to the Lord. <b>Bake that which you will bake and cook that which you will cook,</b> and all that remains put aside to be kept for you until the morning” (Exodus 16:23). <b>From here Rabbi Eliezer said: One may bake</b> on a Festival for Shabbat <b>only</b> by relying <b>on that which was</b> already <b>baked</b> for Shabbat the day before, and adding to it; <b>and one may cook only</b> by relying <b>on that which was</b> already <b>cooked. From this</b> verse <b>the Sages established</b> an allusion <b>to</b> the <b>joining of cooked foods from the Torah.</b> |
| Exodus 16:23 | on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [ shabbaton ], | Shabbat 114b:6 | With regard to trimming vegetables on Yom Kippur, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said, and some say Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, trimming vegetables is prohibited. Rav Mana said: It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>],</b> a holy Shabbat unto the Lord” (Exodus 16:23), which means that there is an obligation to issue a <b>rabbinic prohibition</b> on this day. Issue a rabbinic prohibition <b>for what</b> activity? <b>If you say</b> this refers to prohibiting actual <b>labor, isn’t it written</b> explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9)? <b>Rather, does</b> it not refer to <b>trimming vegetables,</b> which is prohibited on Shabbat even though it is not a full-fledged prohibited labor? The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that trimming vegetables is prohibited. |
| Exodus 16:23 | on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [ shabbaton ], | Shabbat 114b:7 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, trimming vegetables is permitted.</b> The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> from what we learned in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>],</b> a holy Shabbat unto the Lord” (Exodus 16:23), which means that there is an obligation to issue a <b>rabbinic prohibition</b> on this day. Issue a rabbinic prohibition <b>for what</b> activity? <b>If you say</b> this refers to prohibiting actual <b>labor, isn’t it written</b> explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9)? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>trimming vegetables,</b> which is prohibited on Shabbat? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> that is not; rather, solemn rest <b>actually</b> refers <b>to labor.</b> It is a positive commandment to rest on Shabbat. Although the verse says explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; you shall not perform any labor,” this adds that one who performs a prohibited labor <b>violates</b> both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition.</b> |
| Exodus 16:25 | Do not go out, | Arakhin 15b:1 | <b>Do not go out,</b> as indicated in the verse: “And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath for the Lord; today you will not find it in the field” (Exodus 16:25). <b>But</b> nevertheless there were people who <b>went out</b> to look for manna, as it is written: “And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none” (Exodus 16:27). The verse also states: “And Moses said to them: Let <b>no</b> man <b>leave any of it</b> until the morning” (Exodus 16:19), <b>and</b> there were people who <b>left it</b> until morning, as it states: “But they did not listen to Moses; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was angry with them” (Exodus 16:20). |
| Exodus 16:25 | from one verse: “And Moses said: Eat it today, for today is Shabbat for God, today you will not find it in the field” | Shabbat 117b:11 | We learned in the mishna that one may rescue food for three meals on Shabbat. <b>How so?</b> If <b>a fire ignited</b> before the meal on Shabbat evening, one rescues food for three meals; if a fire ignited Shabbat morning, he rescues food for two meals; if a fire ignited in the afternoon, he rescues food for one meal. With regard to meals on Shabbat, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How many meals is a person obligated to eat on Shabbat? Three. Rabbi Ḥidka says: Four. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse: “And Moses said: Eat it today, for today is Shabbat for God, today you will not find it in the field”</b> (Exodus 16:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥidka holds: These three</b> mentions of the word <b>today</b> allude to the number of meals on Shabbat <b>besides the evening</b> meal, as Moses spoke on Shabbat morning. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that these three mentions <b>include the evening</b> meal. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If a <b>fire ignited on Shabbat evening</b>, |
| Exodus 16:25 | day: | Shabbat 118a:7 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: Anyone who fulfills</b> the obligation to eat <b>three meals on Shabbat is rescued from three punishments: From the pangs of the Messiah,</b> i.e., the suffering that precedes the advent of Messiah, <b>and from the judgment of Gehenna, and from the war of Gog and Magog.</b> The Gemara derives that one is rescued <b>from the pangs of Messiah</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day:</b> “Eat it today” (Exodus 16:25). <b>And it is written there,</b> with regard to Messiah, day: <b>“Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the</b> great and awesome <b>day</b> of God” (Malachi 3:23). The Gemara derives that one is rescued <b>from the judgment of Gehenna</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day,</b> as cited above. <b>And it is written there,</b> day: <b>“That day will be a day of wrath,</b> a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and blackness, a day of cloud and thick fog” (Zephaniah 1:15), which is interpreted as referring to the punishment of Gehenna. The Gemara derives that one is rescued <b>from the war of Gog and Magog</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>day. And it is written there,</b> with regard to the War of Gog and Magog, day: “And it shall be on that day, <b>on the day that Gog arrives</b> on the land of Israel” (Ezekiel 38:18). |
| Exodus 16:26 | and it is written: “Six days you shall gather it; | Shabbat 87b:5 | <b>Rav Pappa said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from another verse, as it is stated: <b>“And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel</b> came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, <b>on the fifteenth day of the second month</b> after their departing out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 16:1). <b>And that day was Shabbat, as it is written: “And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the Lord;</b> for He has heard your murmurings against the Lord; and what are we, that you murmur against us?” (Exodus 16:7). The next day the glory of God was revealed, and He told them that in the afternoon the manna and quail would begin to fall, <b>and it is written: “Six days you shall gather it;</b> but on the seventh day is Sabbath, there shall be none in it” (Exodus 16:26). Apparently, the first six days after this command were weekdays on which the manna fell, and the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>fifteenth of Iyyar</b> was <b>Shabbat,</b> the <b>New Moon</b> of <b>Sivan</b> was on the <b>first</b> day <b>of the week.</b> This is <b>difficult</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara answers: According to the Rabbis, <b>a day was added to Iyyar that year</b> and it was thirty days long. Therefore, the New Moon of Sivan was on Monday. |
| Exodus 16:27 | went out | Arakhin 15b:1 | <b>Do not go out,</b> as indicated in the verse: “And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath for the Lord; today you will not find it in the field” (Exodus 16:25). <b>But</b> nevertheless there were people who <b>went out</b> to look for manna, as it is written: “And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none” (Exodus 16:27). The verse also states: “And Moses said to them: Let <b>no</b> man <b>leave any of it</b> until the morning” (Exodus 16:19), <b>and</b> there were people who <b>left it</b> until morning, as it states: “But they did not listen to Moses; and some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was angry with them” (Exodus 16:20). |
| Exodus 16:27 | ruled them, as it is stated: “And it happened on the seventh day, some people went out from the nation to collect | Shabbat 118b:4 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Had the Jewish people</b> properly <b>observed</b> the <b>first Shabbat</b> that was commanded them, <b>no nation or tongue would have</b> ever <b>ruled them, as it is stated: “And it happened on the seventh day, some people went out from the nation to collect</b> and they did not find” (Exodus 16:27). <b>And it is written after</b> they went out to collect manna: <b>“And Amalek came</b> and fought with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: If only the Jewish people would keep two <i>Shabbatot</i> in accordance with their <i>halakhot</i>,</b> they would be <b>immediately redeemed,</b> as <b>it is stated: “So said God to the eunuchs who will keep My Shabbatot”</b> (Isaiah 56:4), <b>and it is written after</b> that: <b>“And I will bring them to My holy mountain</b> and will let them rejoice in My house of prayer” (Isaiah 56:7). |
| Exodus 16:28 | “How long do you refuse [ me’antem ] to keep My commandments and My laws?” | Bava Kamma92a:18 | Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The Lord said to Moses after some of the people collected the manna on Shabbat: <b>“How long do you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>] to keep My commandments and My laws?”</b> (Exodus 16:28). The term “you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>]” is written in the plural, indicating that even Moses was included, although he did not sin. |
| Exodus 16:28 | How long do you refuse | Sanhedrin 11a:6 | The Gemara continues: <b>And from where did Shecaniah ben Jehiel learn it? From</b> an incident involving <b>Joshua, as it is written: “And the Lord said to Joshua: Get yourself up; why do you fall upon your face? Israel has sinned”</b> (Joshua 7:10–11). Joshua <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, who sinned?</b> God <b>said to him: And am I your informer?</b> Rather, <b>cast lots</b> to determine who is guilty. In this way, God did not directly disclose the identity of the sinner to Joshua. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Shecaniah ben Jehiel learned this <b>from</b> an incident involving <b>Moses, as it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Moses: <b>How long do you refuse</b> to keep My mitzvot and My laws?” (Exodus 16:28). Although only a small number of people attempted to collect the manna on Shabbat, God spoke as though the entire nation were guilty, so as not to directly expose the guilty. |
| Exodus 16:29 | joining of Shabbat boundaries. | Eruvin 17b:10 | <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One is flogged by Torah law for</b> going beyond the Shabbat limit if there is no <b>joining of Shabbat boundaries.</b> The Torah states: “No man shall go out [<i>al yetze</i>] of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29). Since this is a Torah prohibition, leniency is possible only in life-threatening circumstances. |
| Exodus 16:29 | “Remain every man in his place; | Eruvin 48a:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse <b>“Remain every man in his place;</b> let no man go out of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29), means one must restrict his movement to an area <b>equal to his place. And how much is</b> the area of <b>his place?</b> A person’s <b>body</b> typically measures <b>three cubits, and an</b> additional <b>cubit</b> is needed <b>in order</b> to allow him <b>to spread out his hands and feet,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A person’s <b>body</b> measures <b>three cubits, and an</b> additional <b>cubit</b> is needed <b>in order</b> to allow him <b>to pick up an object from under his feet and place it under his head,</b> meaning, to give him room to maneuver. |
| Exodus 16:29 | “Remain every man in his place” | Eruvin 51a:7 | The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <b>These two thousand cubits, where are</b> they <b>written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remain every man in his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>four cubits,</b> which constitute the minimum Shabbat limit, e.g., for one who ventured beyond his prescribed limit. <b>“Let no man go out of his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> of the Shabbat limit for one who remains in his place. Unless otherwise specified, the measure of one’s place is two thousand cubits. |
| Exodus 16:31 | “And it was white [ lavan ] like coriander seed; and its flavor | Yoma 75a:11 | With regard to the manna, the Torah further states: <b>“And it was white [<i>lavan</i>] like coriander seed; and its flavor</b> was like wafers made of honey” (Exodus 16:31). The Gemara questions this, since coriander is brown, not white. <b>Rabbi Asi said:</b> The manna was <b>round like coriander</b> seed <b>but white like a pearl. This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Coriander [<i>gad</i>]</b> is so named <b>because it is similar to flax seeds on their stalks,</b> which are bound [<i>agud</i>] in a bundle. |
| Exodus 16:31 | and it is written “honey” | Yoma 75b:5 | With regard to the manna, <b>it is written “bread”</b> (Exodus 16:4), <b>and it is written “oil”</b> (Numbers 11:8), <b>and it is written “honey”</b> (Exodus 16:31). How can we reconcile these verses? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: For the youth</b> it was like <b>bread, for the elderly</b> it was like <b>oil,</b> and <b>for the children</b> it was like <b>honey.</b> Each received what was appropriate. |
| Exodus 16:33 | “generations.” | Keritot 5b:19 | The <i>halakha</i> that the anointing oil was to be kept together with the Ark is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“generations”</b> and <b>“generations.”</b> This term is stated with regard to the jar of manna: “To be kept throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33), and also with regard to the anointing oil: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil to Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31). |
| Exodus 16:33 | there, | Yoma 52b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy, as it is written with regard to the Ark: “That is by the Ark of the Testimony, before the Ark cover that is above the testimony, <b>there</b> will I meet with you” (Exodus 30:6), and it is written: “Take a jar and put a full <i>omer</i> of manna <b>there,</b> and place it before the Lord for safekeeping throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33). <b>And it is</b> further <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy from the term <b>“Generations”</b> written here and <b>“generations”</b> written with regard to the oil used for anointing: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil for Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31). |
| Exodus 16:35 | as it is written: “And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years until they came to a settled land; they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan” | Kiddushin 38a:3 | This is <b>as it is written: “And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years until they came to a settled land; they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan”</b> (Exodus 16:35). The Gemara analyzes this verse: <b>One cannot say</b> they ate <b>“until they came to a settled land,”</b> i.e., that they were still eating the manna when they entered Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is already stated: “To the borders of the land of Canaan,”</b> which indicates that they stopped eating manna before entering Eretz Yisrael, on the plains of Moab. <b>And one cannot say</b> that they ate manna only until they reached <b>“to the borders of the land of Canaan,” as it is already stated: “Until they came to a settled land.” How</b> can <b>these</b> clauses be reconciled? <b>Moses died on the seventh of Adar and the manna ceased falling, and they ate the manna that was</b> left <b>in their vessels until the sixteenth of Nisan,</b> even after they entered Eretz Yisrael. |
| Exodus 16:35 | “And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years” | Kiddushin 38a:4 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years”</b> (Exodus 16:35). <b>But did they</b> really <b>eat</b> it for <b>forty years? But didn’t they eat</b> it for <b>forty years less thirty days?</b> The manna began to fall on the sixteenth of Iyyar in the first year in the wilderness, and they stopped eating it on the sixteenth of Nisan in the fortieth year. <b>Rather, this</b> verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>they tasted the taste of manna</b> in the unleavened <b>cakes that they took out from Egypt</b> on the fifteenth of Nisan in their first year, and this sustained them until the manna fell. |
| Exodus 16:36 | as it is written: “And an omer is the tenth part of an eifa ” | Eruvin 83b:2 | The Gemara responds: The Torah states that the manna, the dough of the wilderness, was “an <i>omer</i> a head” (Exodus 16:16). A later verse elaborates on that measure, <b>as it is written: “And an <i>omer</i> is the tenth part of an <i>eifa</i>”</b> (Exodus 16:36). An <i>eifa</i> is three <i>se’a</i>, which are eighteen <i>kav</i> or seventy-two <i>log</i>. An <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of this measure. <b>From here,</b> this calculation, Sages <b>said</b> that dough prepared from <b>seven quarters</b> of a <i>kav</i> of <b>flour and more is obligated in <i>ḥalla</i>. This is equal to six</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Jerusalem</b> measure, <b>which is five</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Tzippori</b> measure. |
| Exodus 17:1 | to drink” | Arakhin 15a:20 | The Jewish people also tested God <b>in Rephidim, as it is written:</b> “And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, <b>and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water</b> for the people <b>to drink”</b> (Exodus 17:1). <b>And it is written: “And the people fought with Moses,</b> and said: Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them: Why do you fight with me? Why do you test the Lord?” (Exodus 17:2). |
| Exodus 17:2 | And it is written: “And the people fought with Moses, | Arakhin 15a:20 | The Jewish people also tested God <b>in Rephidim, as it is written:</b> “And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, <b>and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water</b> for the people <b>to drink”</b> (Exodus 17:1). <b>And it is written: “And the people fought with Moses,</b> and said: Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them: Why do you fight with me? Why do you test the Lord?” (Exodus 17:2). |
| Exodus 17:5 | and your rod, with which you struck the river, | Sanhedrin 99b:13 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who causes another to</b> engage in <b>a matter of a mitzva, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he performed it</b> himself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the Lord said to Moses…<b>and your rod, with which you struck the river,</b> take in your hand and go” (Exodus 17:5). <b>And</b> was it <b>Moses</b> who <b>struck</b> the river? <b>But isn’t</b> it written explicitly (see Exodus 7:19–20) that <b>Aaron struck</b> the river? <b>Rather,</b> that verse serves <b>to say to you: Anyone who causes another to</b> engage in <b>a matter of a mitzva, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he performed it</b> himself. |
| Exodus 17:6 | “Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock | Bava Metzia86b:13 | With regard to Abraham, the verse states: <b>“And he stood by them under the tree,</b> and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: <b>“Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock</b> in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: <b>“And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way”</b> (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). |
| Exodus 17:6 | “And you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink” | Bava Metzia86b:14 | By contrast, Abraham performed certain actions through an agent. He said: <b>“Let now a little water be fetched”</b> (Genesis 18:4), and correspondingly the verse states in reference to Moses, God’s messenger: <b>“And you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink”</b> (Exodus 17:6). |
| Exodus 17:8 | the term: “Rephidim,” | Bekhorot 5b:4 | Rabbi Ḥanina continues: <b>And furthermore, I</b> also <b>asked</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the term: “Rephidim,”</b> in the verse: “Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim” (Exodus 17:8)? <b>And he said to me</b> that <b>Rephidim</b> was <b>its name,</b> i.e., of the location. The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its</b> actual <b>name</b> was <b>Rephidim. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>became lax [<i>rippu</i>] with regard to the statements of the Torah</b> in Rephidim, <b>and so it says: “The fathers look not back to their children because of feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3). |
| Exodus 17:8 | “And Amalek came | Shabbat 118b:4 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Had the Jewish people</b> properly <b>observed</b> the <b>first Shabbat</b> that was commanded them, <b>no nation or tongue would have</b> ever <b>ruled them, as it is stated: “And it happened on the seventh day, some people went out from the nation to collect</b> and they did not find” (Exodus 16:27). <b>And it is written after</b> they went out to collect manna: <b>“And Amalek came</b> and fought with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: If only the Jewish people would keep two <i>Shabbatot</i> in accordance with their <i>halakhot</i>,</b> they would be <b>immediately redeemed,</b> as <b>it is stated: “So said God to the eunuchs who will keep My Shabbatot”</b> (Isaiah 56:4), <b>and it is written after</b> that: <b>“And I will bring them to My holy mountain</b> and will let them rejoice in My house of prayer” (Isaiah 56:7). |
| Exodus 17:9 | “ Maḥar ” | Yoma 52b:3 | Likewise, the term: <b>“<i>Maḥar</i>”</b> (Exodus 17:9) can be read: “And go out, fight with Amalek tomorrow [<i>maḥar</i>]”. Alternatively, it can mean that Joshua must go out to war with Amalek immediately, and Moses added: “Tomorrow [<i>maḥar</i>] I will stand on the top of the hill” (Exodus 17:9), but today you do not need my prayer. Once again, the issue is whether this term belongs to the beginning or the end of the verse. |
| Exodus 17:11 | “And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; | Rosh Hashanah29a:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> Incidental to the discussion of the required intent when sounding the <i>shofar</i>, the mishna cites the verse: <b>“And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed;</b> and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed” (Exodus 17:11). It may be asked: <b>Did the hands of Moses make war</b> when he raised them <b>or break war</b> when he lowered them? <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>as long as the Jewish people turned their eyes upward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they prevailed, but if not, they fell.</b> |
| Exodus 17:12 | rock upon which Moses sat, as it is written: “But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat thereon” | Berakhot 54b:7 | One must recite a blessing when he sees the <b>rock upon which Moses sat, as it is written: “But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat thereon”</b> (Exodus 17:12). |
| Exodus 17:12 | “But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it” | Taanit 11a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather, a person should be distressed together with the community. As we found with Moses our teacher that he was distressed together with the community, as it is stated</b> during the war with Amalek: <b>“But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it”</b> (Exodus 17:12). <b>But didn’t Moses have one pillow or one cushion to sit upon;</b> why was he forced to sit on a rock? <b>Rather, Moses said as follows: Since the Jewish people are immersed in suffering, I too will be with them in suffering,</b> as much as I am able, although I am not participating in the fighting. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And anyone who is distressed together with the community will merit seeing the consolation of the community.</b> |
| Exodus 17:13 | “And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword” | Zevachim 116a:21 | § The Gemara notes that the disagreement between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to when Yitro came to Mount Sinai is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The Torah states with regard to Yitro, before he came to Mount Sinai: <b>“Now Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard</b> of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt” (Exodus 18:1). <b>What tiding did he hear that he came and converted? Rabbi Yehoshua says: He heard</b> about <b>the war with Amalek, as it is written adjacent to</b> the verses that state that Yitro came: <b>“And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword”</b> (Exodus 17:13). |
| Exodus 17:14 | and it is written elsewhere: “And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in the book, | Megillah 18a:12 | § It is taught in the mishna: <b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>by heart he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between one instance of the term <b>remembrance</b> and another instance of the term <b>remembrance. It is written here,</b> with regard to the Megilla: <b>“That these days should be remembered”</b> (Esther 9:28), <b>and it is written elsewhere: “And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in the book,</b> and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: That I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens” (Exodus 17:14). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Amalek, remembrance is referring specifically to something written <b>in a book,</b> as it is stated, “in the book,” <b>so too here,</b> the Megilla remembrance is through being written <b>in a book.</b> |
| Exodus 17:14 | until they found a verse written in the Torah: “Write this for a memorial in the book, | Megillah 7a:5 | The Sages did not accede to Esther’s request <b>until they found a verse written in the Torah: “Write this for a memorial in the book,</b> and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: That I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens” (Exodus 17:14). The Sages interpreted the verse: <b>“Write this,” that which is written</b> in the Torah <b>here</b> in Exodus, <b>and in Deuteronomy; “a memorial,” that which is written in the Prophets,</b> i.e., in I Samuel, on this matter; <b>“in the book,” that which is written in the Megilla.</b> The Megilla is the third mention of Amalek and not the fourth, as both mentions in the Torah pertaining to Amalek are considered one; therefore, Esther would be the third, not the fourth source. |
| Exodus 17:16 | The hand upon the throne of the Lord: | Berakhot 58a:16 | Rabbi Sheila <b>said: Since a miracle was performed on my behalf with this verse</b> that I cited, <b>I will interpret it homiletically: Yours, O Lord, is the greatness; that is the act of creation, and so it says: “Who does great things past finding out”</b> (Job 9:10); <br><b>And the power; that is the exodus from Egypt, as it is stated: “And Israel saw the great work</b> which the Lord did to the <b>Egyptians”</b> (Exodus 14:31);<br><b>And the glory; that is the sun and the moon that stood still for Joshua, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,</b> until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies” (Joshua 10:13);<br><b>And the triumph; that is the downfall of Rome, and so it says</b> describing the downfall of Edom, whom the Sages identified as the forefather of Rome: <b>“Their lifeblood is dashed against My garments</b> and I have stained all My raiment” (Isaiah 63:3);<br><b>And the majesty; this is the war of the valleys of Arnon, as it is stated: “Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: Vahev in Sufa,</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14);<br><b>For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; this is the war of Sisera, as it is stated: “They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses</b> fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).<br><b>Yours is the kingdom, O Lord; this is the war of Amalek, and so it says:</b> “And he said: <b>The hand upon the throne of the Lord:</b> the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), as then God will sit on His throne.<br><b>And you are exalted; this is the war of Gog and Magog, and so it says: “I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshekh and Tubal”</b> (Ezekiel 38:3); and:<br><b>As head above all; Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> All leadership and authority, <b>even</b> the most insignificant, the <b>one responsible for distributing water, is appointed by heaven.</b> |
| Exodus 17:16 | kesya | Pesachim 117a:1 | The mishna states that we will say before Him: <i>Halleluya</i>. The Gemara discusses the meaning of this term. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The word <b><i>halleluya</i></b> and the word <b><i>kesya</i></b> (Exodus 17:16) and the name <b>Yedidya</b> (II Samuel 12:25) <b>are</b> each regarded as <b>a single</b> word, not an amalgamation of two smaller words, i.e., <i>Hallelu</i>-<i>ya</i>. <b>Rav said</b> that <b><i>kesya</i> and <i>merḥavya</i></b> (Psalms 118:5) <b>are single</b> words. <b>Rabba said: Only <i>merḥavya</i></b> is a single word; the others are two words. |
| Exodus 17:16 | states: “The hand upon the throne [ kes ] of the Lord: The Lord will have war with Amalek | Sanhedrin 20b:12 | <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “The hand upon the throne [<i>kes</i>] of the Lord: The Lord will have war with Amalek</b> from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), <b>you must say</b> that this means they are obligated <b>to establish a king for themselves first,</b> before waging war with Amalek, <b>and</b> the verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“Throne</b> of the Lord” <b>is nothing other than</b> a symbolic name for <b>a king, as it is stated: “Then Solomon sat on the throne [<i>kisei</i>] of the Lord as king”</b> (I Chronicles 29:23), indicating that a king sits on “the throne of the Lord.” |
| Exodus 18:1 | “Now Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard | Zevachim 116a:21 | § The Gemara notes that the disagreement between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to when Yitro came to Mount Sinai is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The Torah states with regard to Yitro, before he came to Mount Sinai: <b>“Now Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard</b> of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt” (Exodus 18:1). <b>What tiding did he hear that he came and converted?

| Exodus 18:9 | “ Vayyiḥad Yitro | Sanhedrin 94a:10 | It is written in the previous verse: <b>“<i>Vayyiḥad</i> Yitro</b> for all the goodness that the Lord had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of Egypt” (Exodus 18:9). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to the meaning of <i>vayyiḥad</i>. <b>Rav says: He passed a sharp [<i>ḥad</i>] sword over his flesh,</b> i.e., he circumcised himself and converted. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He felt <b>as</b> though <b>cuts [<i>ḥiddudim</i>] were made over his flesh,</b> i.e., he had an unpleasant feeling due to the downfall of Egypt. <b>Rav says</b> with regard to this statement of Shmuel that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say:</b> With regard to <b>a convert, for ten generations</b> after his conversion <b>one should not disparage a gentile before him</b> and his descendants, as they continue to identify somewhat with gentiles and remain sensitive to their pain. |
| Exodus 18:10 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who delivered | Berakhot 54a:10 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the obligation to recite a blessing for a miracle, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who delivered</b> you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; Who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians” (Exodus 18:10); a blessing is recited for a miracle. |
| Exodus 18:10 | On a similar note, you say: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who has delivered you | Sanhedrin 94a:9 | <b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Pappeyas: It is a disgrace for Hezekiah and his associates that they did not recite a song</b> themselves and that a song was not recited <b>until the earth began and recited a song, as it is stated: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous”</b> (Isaiah 24:16). <b>On a similar note, you say: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who has delivered you</b> out of the hand of Egypt and out of the hand of Pharaoh” (Exodus 18:10). <b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Pappeyas: It is a disgrace for Moses and the six hundred thousand</b> adult men of the children of Israel whom he led out of Egypt <b>that they did not say: Blessed, until Yitro came and said: “Blessed be the Lord.”</b> |
| Exodus 18:11 | for in that which they conspired [ zadu ] against them” | Sotah 11a:11 | <b>Alternatively,</b> there is an additional way to punish the Egyptians with water: <b>He does not bring</b> a flood upon them, <b>but they</b> may <b>come and fall into</b> water, <b>and so it says:</b> “And the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; <b>and the Egyptians fled toward it;</b> and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27), indicating that the Egyptians fell into the water. <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar says: What is the</b> meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, <b>for in that which they conspired [<i>zadu</i>] against them”</b> (Exodus 18:11)? The phrase means: <b>In the pot in which they cooked, they</b> themselves <b>were cooked,</b> as they were punished through drowning, measure for measure, for drowning the Jewish babies. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“<i>zadu</i>” is a term</b> meaning <b>a pot?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob simmered a pot [<i>vayyazed Ya’akov nazid</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:29). |
| Exodus 18:12 | “And Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and offerings for God” | Avodah Zarah24a:20 | The Gemara raises another objection: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“And Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and offerings for God”</b> (Exodus 18:12). Yitro was not a Jew, and yet he brought offerings for God. The Gemara answers: The incident with <b>Yitro was also prior to the giving of the Torah.</b> The Gemara observes: Granted, <b>this works out well according to the one who says</b> that the incident with <b>Yitro was prior to the giving of the Torah. But according to the one who says</b> that |
| Exodus 18:12 | And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who partakes of a meal at which a Torah scholar is present, it is as if he enjoyed the radiant splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God” | Berakhot 64a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who partakes of a meal at which a Torah scholar is present, it is as if he enjoyed the radiant splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God”</b> (Exodus 18:12). <b>Did they</b> actually <b>eat before God? Didn’t they eat before Moses?</b> |
| Exodus 18:12 | “And Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices [ zevaḥim ] | Zevachim 116a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> before the giving of the Torah: <b>“And Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>]</b> for God” (Exodus 18:12)? Since the word <i>zevaḥim</i> there is referring to sacrifices, as the verse clearly states that Yitro took them for God, evidently peace offerings were sacrificed before the giving of the Torah. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written</b> with regard to the period <b>after the giving of the Torah,</b> when the Jewish people were permitted to sacrifice peace offerings. |
| Exodus 18:13 | and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening” | Shabbat 10a:5 | Speaking of judgment, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi would sit and study between the pillars</b> beneath the study hall. <b>And each and every hour they would knock on the bolt of the door and say: If there is</b> someone <b>who</b> has a case that <b>requires judgment, let him enter and come</b> before us. The Gemara also relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit in judgment all day and their hearts would grow weak</b> from hunger. Therefore, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav from Difti taught them</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And it was the next day and Moses sat to judge the people <b>and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening”</b> (Exodus 18:13). <b>Does it enter your mind that Moses would sit and judge all day long?</b> If so, <b>when was his Torah</b> study <b>accomplished? Rather,</b> surely the verse is coming <b>to tell you: Any judge who judges a true judgment truthfully, even if</b> he sits in judgment only <b>one hour, the verse ascribes to him as if he became a partner to the Holy One, Blessed be He, in the act of Creation,</b> as by means of a true judgment he upholds the world (<i>Me’iri</i>). This conclusion is derived by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>]: <b>It is written here: “And the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening.” And it is written there,</b> in the act of Creation: <b>“And it was evening and it was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). The evening and part of the morning are considered a whole day. With regard to this issue as well, it is sufficient for the judges to sit in judgment for only part of the day and there is no need for them to starve themselves by sitting in judgment all day. |
| Exodus 18:13 | while standing, as it is written: “And Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood” | Shevuot 30b:2 | § <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the obligation to stand in court is only <b>with regard to the litigants; but with regard to the witnesses, everyone agrees</b> that they testify <b>while standing, as it is written: “Then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17). <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> whether the litigants are required to stand is only <b>at the time of the deliberation, but at the time of the verdict, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>judges</b> issue the verdict <b>while sitting and the litigants</b> receive the verdict <b>while standing, as it is written: “And Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood”</b> (Exodus 18:13). |
| Exodus 18:20 | Rav Yosef taught | Bava Kamma99b:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>But what is different</b> about <b>Dankhu and Issur, who are exempt due to</b> the fact <b>that they do not need to learn</b> about assessing currency? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya too did not need to learn,</b> as he was also an expert. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> was not actually required to return a dinar to this woman, but when he did so <b>he acted beyond the letter of the law.</b> This is <b>as that</b> which <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> concerning the verse: “And you shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do” (Exodus 18:20): <b>“And you shall show them”; this</b> is referring to |
| Exodus 18:20 | As Rav Yosef taught | Bava Metzia30b:11 | The Gemara cites a source for going beyond the letter of the law in the performance of mitzvot. <b>As Rav Yosef taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the path wherein they shall walk and the action that they must perform” (Exodus 18:20). The <i>baraita</i> parses the various directives in the verse. <b>“And you shall teach them,” that</b> is referring to <b>the structure of their livelihood,</b> i.e., teach the Jewish people trades so that they may earn a living; <b>“the path,” that</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness; “they shall walk,” that</b> is referring to <b>visiting the ill; “wherein,” that</b> is referring to <b>burial; “and the action,” that</b> is referring to acting in accordance with the letter of the <b>law; “that they must perform,” that</b> is referring to acting <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b> |
| Exodus 18:20 | feminine, as it is written: “And you shall show them the way [ derekh ] in which [ bah ] they must walk” | Kiddushin 2b:6 | The Gemara continues to analyze the style of the mishna: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: Three [<i>shalosh</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine? <b>Let it teach: Three [<i>shelosha</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the masculine. The Gemara explains: The mishna uses this form <b>because it wants to teach</b> the word <b>way [<i>derekh</i>], and <i>derekh</i> is formulated</b> in the <b>feminine, as it is written: “And you shall show them the way [<i>derekh</i>] in which [<i>bah</i>] they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20). The term <i>bah</i>, which is referring to <i>derekh</i>, is formulated in the feminine. |
| Exodus 18:20 | The verses do not contradict each other. Here, | Kiddushin 2b:8 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verses do not contradict each other. Here,</b> that verse: “The way in which they must walk” (Exodus 18:20), <b>is referring to the Torah,</b> i.e., the way mentioned here is referring to the path of the Torah, <b>and Torah is referred to</b> in the <b>feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect [<i>temima</i>], restoring the soul”</b> (Psalms 19:8). The word <i>temima</i> is in the feminine. Consequently, in reference to the Torah the verse <b>writes:</b> <i>Derekh</i>, <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There, that</b> verse: “Shall flee before you seven ways” (Deuteronomy 28:7), <b>is referring to war,</b> and <b>as it is the way of a man to wage war and it is not the way of a woman to wage war,</b> it is appropriate to speak in the masculine. Therefore, the verse <b>writes</b> the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine.</b> |
| Exodus 18:20 | “And you shall show them the way in which they must walk” | Moed Katan5a:20 | <b>Rav Ḥinnana said:</b> This may be derived from the end of that very same verse: <b>“Take up the stumbling block from the way of My people”</b> (Isaiah 57:14). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> This may be derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall show them the way in which they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20), i.e., you must properly repair the roads, which includes marking graves. |
| Exodus 18:21 | “And place over them ministers of thousands, ministers of hundreds, ministers of fifties, and ministers of tens” | Sanhedrin 18a:3 | Apropos the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, which links the issue of the lesser Sanhedrin with the appointment of the ministers in the wilderness, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And place over them ministers of thousands, ministers of hundreds, ministers of fifties, and ministers of tens”</b> (Exodus 18:21). The number of <b>ministers of thousands</b> was <b>600,</b> as there were 600,000 men in total; the number of <b>ministers of hundreds</b> was <b>6,000;</b> of <b>ministers of fifties, 12,000,</b> and of <b>ministers of tens, 60,000.</b> Therefore, <b>it is found</b> that the total number of <b>judges of the Jewish people</b> was <b>78,600,</b> and suitable people were found to fill all of these positions. |
| Exodus 18:22 | and bear it with you” | Horayot 4b:15 | The Gemara challenges: <b>And say that</b> the term <b>“with you,”</b> means that they shall be like Moses in that they will all be fit <b>for the Divine Presence</b> to rest upon them. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that it is derived as <b>the verse states</b> in the context of the advice that Yitro gave to Moses: “And they shall judge the people at all times…and ease your burden from upon you <b>and bear it with you”</b> (Exodus 18:22). <b>“With you”</b> is interpreted to mean: <b>Similar to you.</b> |
| Exodus 18:22 | the verse states: “So shall they make it easier for you and bear the burden with you” | Kiddushin 76b:7 | The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> those who were with Moses had to be free of any blemish <b>due to</b> the <b>Divine Presence,</b> which rested upon them, but this is not a requirement for judges on the Sanhedrin. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse states: “So shall they make it easier for you and bear the burden with you”</b> (Exodus 18:22). The phrase “with you” is explained to mean: <b>With similarity to you,</b> i.e., without blemish. This verse is referring to the appointment of regular judges, upon whom the Divine Presence does not rest, and teaches that all members of the Sanhedrin must be whole in body. The verse from Song of Songs teaches that they must be of unflawed lineage as well. |
| Exodus 18:22 | “They shall bring every great matter to you” | Sanhedrin 16a:1 | <b>we are dealing with the <i>Nasi</i> of a tribe who has sinned. Doesn’t Rav Adda bar Ahava say:</b> The verse states: <b>“They shall bring every great matter to you”</b> (Exodus 18:22), meaning: <b>Matters of a great one,</b> i.e., in any case where a great person is accused of a transgression whose punishment is death, he is tried by the Great Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges. And <b>this</b> <i>Nasi</i> of the tribe <b>is also a great one,</b> so his trial is by seventy-one judges. |
| Exodus 18:22 | Rav Adda bar Ahava says that the verse states: “They shall bring every great matter to you” | Sanhedrin 16a:10 | § The mishna teaches that <b>the High Priest</b> may be judged only by the Great Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy-one judges. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says that the verse states: “They shall bring every great matter to you”</b> (Exodus 18:22). This means that Moses, or the Great Sanhedrin with seventy-one judges, which served the parallel role to that of Moses, adjudicates all <b>matters</b> relating <b>to a great one,</b> i.e., the High Priest. |
| Exodus 18:22 | “And they shall make it easier for you, and bear the burden with you” | Sanhedrin 17a:3 | <b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive that <i>halakha</i>? They <b>derive it from</b> what was stated with regard to the appointment of the ministers of thousands and the ministers of hundreds: <b>“And they shall make it easier for you, and bear the burden with you”</b> (Exodus 18:22), understanding the term “with you” to mean: Similar to you. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the judges of <b>the Great Sanhedrin</b> of seventy <b>is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the judges of <b>the lesser Sanhedrin,</b> i.e., those ministers, that Moses appointed. |
| Exodus 18:22 | “every great matter they shall bring unto you” | Sanhedrin 18b:3 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara responds: No, as it could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since we learned</b> in the mishna (2a): The court <b>judges</b> cases involving an entire <b>tribe</b> that sinned, <b>or a false prophet, or a High Priest, only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges, i.e., the Great Sanhedrin, <b>and</b> since <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says</b> that the phrase <b>“every great matter they shall bring unto you”</b> (Exodus 18:22), refers to the <b>matters of a great</b> person, the High Priest, who is judged in a court of seventy-one, therefore, one might <b>say</b> that this means <b>all the matters of a great</b> person, including non-capital transgressions, are judged in a court of seventy-one. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that for non-capital transgressions, he is treated like an ordinary person, and judged even by a court of three. |
| Exodus 18:22 | Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Pappa says: As the verse states: “And let them judge the people at all times” | Sanhedrin 34b:8 | § The mishna teaches: In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>judges during the daytime,</b> and may conclude the deliberations and issue their ruling even at night. Before discussing this ruling, the Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for three of the forthcoming discussions: <b>Judgment, answer, incline.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> concerning the time of the deliberations derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Pappa says: As the verse states: “And let them judge the people at all times”</b> (Exodus 18:22), indicating that the judgment can be during the day or at night. |
| Exodus 18:22 | and bear the burden with you” | Sanhedrin 36b:11 | The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps there,</b> those who were with Moses had to be free of any blemish <b>due to</b> the <b>Divine Presence,</b> which was going to rest upon them, but this is not a requirement for judges to serve on the Sanhedrin. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: The verse states:</b> “So shall they make it easier for you <b>and bear the burden with you”</b> (Exodus 18:22). The term <b>“with you”</b> is explained to mean: <b>They shall be similar to you,</b> without blemish. This verse is referring to the appointment of regular judges, upon whom the Divine Presence does not rest, and teaches that all members of the Sanhedrin must be whole in body, and the verse from Song of Songs teaches that they must have unflawed lineage as well. |
| Exodus 18:23 | “And all these people shall also go to their place in peace” | Sanhedrin 7a:11 | There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was saying as he walked:</b> With regard to one <b>who goes from the court,</b> and his <b>cloak</b> has been <b>taken</b> from him in the course of the proceedings, i.e., he lost all his money due to a ruling against him, <b>let him sing a song and go</b> happily <b>on the way.</b> Although he lost the case, he has benefited from justice being served. <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: A verse</b> is <b>written</b> with regard to Yitro’s advice for judiciary reforms that conveys the message of this aphorism: <b>“And all these people shall also go to their place in peace”</b> (Exodus 18:23). If justice is served, all the litigants, not only those who emerge victorious, can leave in peace. |
| Exodus 18:26 | “They brought the difficult matter to Moses” | Sanhedrin 16a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “They shall bring every <b>great matter</b> to you,” which is interpreted to mean that <b>a difficult matter</b> is judged by the Great Sanhedrin. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse is actually referring to <b>a difficult matter, or is it only</b> referring to <b>the matters</b> relating <b>to a great one?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>When it states</b> in a different verse that Moses implemented Yitro’s advice: <b>“They brought the difficult matter to Moses”</b> (Exodus 18:26), <b>a difficult matter is stated</b> explicitly. As Moses was following the directive of Yitro, it is therefore apparent that the term “great matter” is referring to a difficult matter. |
| Exodus 19:1 | And it says: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out | Rosh Hashanah3a:13 | <b>And it says: “And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month,</b> on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the Tabernacle of the testimony” (Numbers 10:11). <b>And it says: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out</b> of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai” (Exodus 19:1). <b>And it says: “And he began to build</b> in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign” (II Chronicles 3:2). This list of verses summarizes Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation. |
| Exodus 19:1 | as it is written: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, | Rosh Hashanah3a:6 | The Gemara asks further: <b>And say</b> that the <b>New Year</b> for this purpose <b>is</b> in the third month, the month of <b>Sivan.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,</b> the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai” (Exodus 19:1). <b>And if it is so</b> that the New Year is the beginning of Sivan, the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b>In the third month, in the second year after</b> the children of Israel <b>had gone out</b> of the land of Egypt, as a new year had started. |

| Exodus 19:3 | states: “And Moses went up to God” | Sanhedrin 21b:24 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Ezra was suitable,</b> given his greatness, <b>for</b> the <b>Torah to be given by him to the Jewish people, had Moses not come first</b> and received the Torah already. <b>With regard to Moses</b> the verse <b>states: “And Moses went up to God”</b> (Exodus 19:3), and <b>with regard to Ezra</b> the verse <b>states: “This Ezra went up from Babylon</b> and he was a ready scribe in the Torah of Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given” (Ezra 7:6). <b>Just as</b> the <b>going up stated here,</b> with regard to Moses, is for the <b>Torah,</b> which he received from God and transmitted to the Jewish people, <b>so too,</b> the <b>going up stated there,</b> with regard to Ezra, is for the <b>Torah,</b> as he taught Torah to the Jewish people and was suitable to have originally merited to give it. |
| Exodus 19:3 | on high? But isn’t it written: “And Moses went up to God” | Sukkah 5a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did Moses and Elijah never ascend to</b> the heavens <b>on high? But isn’t it written: “And Moses went up to God”</b> (Exodus 19:3)? <br>The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, he remained <b>below ten</b> handbreadths adjacent to the ground. <br>The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Elijah went up by a whirlwind heavenward”</b> (II Kings 2:11)? <br>The Gemara answers: Here, too, it was <b>below ten</b> handbreadths. <br>The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “He grasps the face of the throne, and spreads His cloud upon him”</b> (Job 26:9)? <b>And Rabbi Tanḥum said:</b> This <b>teaches that the Almighty spread of the radiance of His Divine Presence and of His cloud upon him.</b> Apparently, Moses was in the cloud with God. <br>The Gemara answers: Here, too, it was <b>below ten</b> handbreadths. |

| Exodus 19:6 | and said to me: “A kingdom of priests, and a holy nation” | Zevachim 19a:2 | <b>Rav Ashi says: Huna bar Natan said to me: Once, I was standing before Izgadar, king</b> of Persia, <b>and my belt was raised</b> above its appropriate height, <b>and he lowered it</b> into place <b>and said to me: “A kingdom of priests, and a holy nation”</b> (Exodus 19:6), <b>is written about you;</b> therefore, you should always look dignified. <b>When I came before Ameimar</b> and recounted this incident, <b>he said to me: With regard to you,</b> God’s promise to Israel: <b>“And kings shall be your foster fathers”</b> (Isaiah 49:23), <b>was fulfilled.</b> |
| Exodus 19:7 | he is not flogged | Pesachim 63b:5 | As <b>it was stated</b> that if a person said: I take <b>an oath that I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both said</b> that <b>he is not flogged</b> even though he violated his oath and thereby transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 19:7). However, they disagree about the reason for this law. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He is not flogged because it is a prohibition whose</b> transgression <b>does not involve an action,</b> as his transgression was in failing to eat the loaf, and there is a principle that <b>for any prohibition whose</b> transgression <b>does not involve an action one is not flogged; however, an uncertain warning is considered a</b> valid <b>warning.</b> |
| Exodus 19:8 | “And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord” | Shabbat 87a:7 | According to the opinion of the Rabbis, that day was the <b>third</b> day of <b>what</b> reckoning? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 19:8). <b>And it is written</b> immediately thereafter: “And God said to Moses: Behold I will come to you in a thick cloud so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will also believe in you forever. <b>And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 19:9). |
| Exodus 19:9 | verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud, | Kiddushin 30a:13 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> Does the midpoint of the verses in the Torah, which is <b>“then he shall be shaven,”</b> belong <b>to this side or to this side? Abaye said to him:</b> Even if we cannot count the letters, <b>we can at least bring</b> a Torah scroll <b>to count the verses.</b> Rav Yosef explained: <b>We are not experts about verses either, as when Rav Aḥa bar Adda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: In the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>they divide this</b> following <b>verse into three</b> separate <b>verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud,</b> that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever; And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9). Perhaps there are other verses that we do not know how to divide properly. |
| Exodus 19:9 | divide this verse into three verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud, | Nedarim 38a:2 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>divide this verse into three verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud,</b> that the people may hear as I speak with you, and may also believe in you forever; and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord” (Exodus 19:9). |
| Exodus 19:9 | And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord” | Shabbat 87a:7 | According to the opinion of the Rabbis, that day was the <b>third</b> day of <b>what</b> reckoning? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 19:8). <b>And it is written</b> immediately thereafter: “And God said to Moses: Behold I will come to you in a thick cloud so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will also believe in you forever. <b>And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 19:9). |
| Exodus 19:10 | and sanctify them today and tomorrow | Shabbat 87a:1 | <b>On the third</b> day of the week, God <b>said to them the mitzva of setting boundaries</b> around Mount Sinai. <b>On the fourth</b> day of the week, the husbands and wives <b>separated</b> from one another. <b>And the Rabbis hold: On the second</b> day <b>of the week</b> the <b>New Moon was established,</b> and <b>on the second</b> day <b>of the week</b> God <b>did not say anything to them due to the weariness</b> caused by <b>their journey.

| Exodus 19:10 | “Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments” | Yevamot 46b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that he derived it <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> that in preparation for the revelation at Sinai, God commanded Moses: <b>“Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments”</b> (Exodus 19:10), as Rabbi Yehoshua understands that the washing mentioned in this verse is the ritual immersion of clothes, this leads to the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as in a case where</b> one became impure through contact with some source of impurity, <b>washing,</b> i.e., immersion, of clothes <b>is not required</b> but <b>immersion</b> of one’s body <b>is required,</b> then <b>in a case where washing</b> of clothes <b>is required,</b> as in the preparation for the revelation at Sinai, <b>isn’t it logical that immersion</b> of one’s body <b>should</b> also <b>be required?</b> |
| Exodus 19:10 | it is written: “And sanctify them today and tomorrow” | Yevamot 62a:5 | When Moses <b>added one day</b> to the days of separation before the revelation at Sinai based <b>on his</b> own <b>perception, what did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? He reasoned <b>that</b> since <b>it is written: “And sanctify them today and tomorrow”</b> (Exodus 19:10), the juxtaposition of the words “today” and “tomorrow” teaches that <b>today</b> is <b>like tomorrow: Just as tomorrow</b> the men and women will separate for that day <b>and</b> the <b>night</b> preceding <b>it, so too, today</b> requires separation for the day <b>and</b> the <b>night</b> preceding <b>it.</b> Since God spoke to him in the morning, <b>and the night of that day</b> already <b>passed,</b> Moses said: <b>Conclude from</b> this that separation must be in effect for <b>two days aside from now,</b> i.e., not including the day of the command. Therefore, he extended the mitzva of separation by one day. <b>And his perception agreed with the perception of the Omnipresent, as</b> the <b>Divine Presence did not rest</b> upon Mount Sinai <b>until Shabbat</b> morning, as Moses had determined. |
| Exodus 19:11 | “And be prepared for the third day, | Shabbat 87a:6 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional difficulty from the verse: <b>“And be prepared for the third day,</b> for on the third day God will descend onto Mount Sinai before the eyes of the entire nation” (Exodus 19:11). This indicates that God said that the Torah would be given on the third day after two days of separation. This is <b>difficult</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t we say</b> that <b>Moses added one day</b> based <b>on his</b> own <b>perception? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof against this from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. That which is stated in the Torah: “For on the <b>third</b> day,” means <b>the third</b> day <b>of the month and the third</b> day <b>of the week.</b> Apparently, the New Moon was on Sunday. This is <b>difficult</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Rabbis</b> could have <b>said to you: Whose</b> is the opinion in <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> poses no difficulty to the opinion of the Rabbis. |
| Exodus 19:13 | “Whether it be animal or person, it shall not live” | Bava Kamma54b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the sources for all of the <i>halakhot</i> enumerated in the mishna that apply to all animals. <b>With regard to falling</b> into <b>a pit,</b> it is <b>written: “He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), which means that <b>any</b> animal <b>that has owners</b> is included, <b>as we mentioned</b> (see 54a). <b>With regard to</b> the requirement that animals keep their <b>distance</b> from <b>Mount Sinai</b> before the giving of the Torah, this is derived from the verse: <b>“Whether it be animal or person, it shall not live”</b> (Exodus 19:13), <b>and an undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] is</b> also <b>included in</b> the term <b>animal [<i>behema</i>].</b> In addition, the word <b>“whether”</b> serves <b>to include birds.</b> |
| Exodus 19:13 | “When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount” | Beitzah 5a:7 | <b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As it is written,</b> after the Jews received the Torah: <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), where “your tents” is referring to your wives. <b>And it says,</b> before the revelation at Sinai: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). And it is stated: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). In other words, although the original prohibition served a particular purpose, in this case the giving of the Torah, it was nevertheless necessary to explicitly render the prohibition permitted. |
| Exodus 19:13 | “When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount” | Beitzah 5b:4 | <b>And if you say</b> an alternative explanation, that the instruction to “return to your tents” was not given to permit the men to return home to their wives, but rather <b>it came</b> as a special command <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva of conjugal rights,</b> i.e., the obligation of a man to engage in periodic marital relations with his wife, then it was to refute this possibility that Rav Yosef continued: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from another verse: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). |
| Exodus 19:13 | Sinai: | Keritot 4a:8 | <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: You shall eat no <b>fat of an ox, I would say: Let us derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“ox”</b> stated here as a paradigm representing every type of domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>] and the word <b>“ox,”</b> i.e., <i>behema</i>, stated with regard to a mitzva given in preparation for the revelation at <b>Sinai:</b> “Whether it be animal [<i>behema</i>] or man, it shall not live” (Exodus 19:13). |
| Exodus 19:13 | Sinai | Sanhedrin 15b:6 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>By how many</b> judges would <b>an ox</b> at Mount <b>Sinai</b> have been judged? At the time of the giving of the Torah it was forbidden to ascend onto Mount Sinai, as it is written: “No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot through; whether animal or man, it shall not live” (Exodus 19:13). If an ox did ascend the mountain, how many judges would be necessary to sentence it to execution by stoning? The Gemara explains the question: <b>Do</b> we <b>derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies only to a specific <b>time from</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies for all <b>generations,</b> and accordingly any animal that is to be stoned is judged by twenty-three judges; <b>or not?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from <b>that</b> which <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Whether animal or man it shall not live.”</b> The comparison serves to teach that <b>just as a person</b> is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>so too an animal</b> is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. |
| Exodus 19:13 | whether it be animal or man, it shall not live” | Sanhedrin 67a:21 | <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is stated here: “You shall not allow a witch to live,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to Mount Sinai: “No hand shall touch it, for he shall be stoned, or thrown down; <b>whether it be animal or man, it shall not live”</b> (Exodus 19:13). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse speaks <b>of stoning, so too here,</b> a witch is executed <b>by stoning.</b> |
| Exodus 19:13 | the Torah said: “When the shofar sounds long they shall come up to the mount” | Taanit 21b:4 | Upon hearing this impressive argument, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: Let the Master arise and come</b> to live <b>with us</b> as our community leader. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>not the place of a person</b> that <b>honors him; rather,</b> the <b>person honors his place, as we found with regard to Mount Sinai, that as long as the Divine Presence rested upon it, the Torah said: “Neither let the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount”</b> (Exodus 34:3). Once <b>the Divine Presence departed from</b> the mountain, <b>the Torah said: “When the <i>shofar</i> sounds long they shall come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). This indicates that the sanctity was not inherent to the place but was due to the Divine Presence resting there. |
| Exodus 19:15 | is saying. Now since it is written: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman” | Beitzah 5b:3 | The Gemara seeks to clarify why Rav Yosef cited two verses as proof. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for: <b>And it says?</b> Why does Rav Yosef find it necessary to quote a second verse? The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what he <b>is saying. Now since it is written: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman”</b> (Exodus 19:15), <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26)? After three days the prohibition would lapse in any case. <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>any matter</b> established by <b>a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b> |
| Exodus 19:15 | who had experienced a seminal emission, | Niddah 42a:11 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different explanation of Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s dilemma: <b>Actually, he did not hear the <i>baraita</i></b> and was unaware of it. <b>And</b> as for the question of why he would think that the woman should have the status of one who experienced an emission of an impure bodily substance, <b>this was his dilemma: Since the Merciful One was stringent</b> before the giving of the Torah <b>on</b> Mount <b>Sinai with regard to</b> men <b>who had experienced a seminal emission,</b> in that they were prohibited from attending that event, as it is stated: “Be ready on the third day; do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15), whereas those who had come into contact with other impure items were not prohibited from attending, perhaps the stringency of this particular source of impurity should likewise be applied to a woman who discharges semen. If so, <b>her</b> status should be like one who <b>experienced</b> a seminal emission, rather than one who merely came into contact with semen. |
| Exodus 19:15 | prepare yourselves for three days, | Shabbat 86a:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the third day</b> after relations <b>is ritually impure,</b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days,</b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the third day,</b> meaning the third day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The mishna cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water. |
| Exodus 19:15 | do not approach | Shabbat 87a:4 | <b>And he</b> totally <b>separated from</b> his <b>wife</b> after the revelation at Sinai. <b>What</b> source <b>did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? <b>He reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i> inference by himself</b> and <b>said: If Israel, with whom the Divine Presence spoke only one time and</b> God <b>set a</b> specific <b>time for them</b> when the Divine Presence would be revealed, and yet <b>the Torah stated: “Prepare yourselves</b> for three days, <b>do not approach</b> a woman” (Exodus 19:15); <b>I, with whom the Divine Presence speaks all the time and</b> God <b>does not set a</b> specific <b>time for me, all the more so</b> that I must separate from my wife. <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, agreed with him? As it is written</b> after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), meaning to your homes and wives. <b>And afterward it is written</b> that God told Moses: <b>“And you, stand here with Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), indicating that Moses was not allowed to return home, as he must constantly be prepared to receive the word of God. <b>And some say</b> a different source indicating that God agreed with his reasoning. When Aaron and Miriam criticized Moses’ separation from his wife, God said: <b>“With him do I speak mouth to mouth,</b> even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord does he behold; why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?” (Numbers 12:8). This indicates that God agreed with his reasoning. |
| Exodus 19:15 | the Torah stated: “Do not approach a woman” | Yevamot 62a:2 | The Gemara clarifies: When Moses <b>separated from</b> his <b>wife</b> after the revelation at Sinai, <b>what did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? <b>He said: If</b> in the case of <b>Israel, with whom the Divine Presence spoke only temporarily and for whom</b> God <b>set</b> a specific <b>time for</b> revelation, <b>the Torah stated: “Do not approach a woman”</b> (Exodus 19:15), <b>I,</b> Moses, <b>who am set aside for</b> divine <b>speech all the time and for whom</b> God <b>did not set</b> a specific <b>time, all the more so</b> I must separate from my wife. <b>And his perception agreed with the perception of the Omnipresent, as it is stated</b> after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents; and you, stand here with Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26–27). This indicates that whereas others could return to their homes and normal married life after the revelation at Sinai, Moses was to stay with God and not return to his wife. |
| Exodus 19:16 | the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [ kolot ], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the shofar ” | Berakhot 6b:30 | <b>What is his reward if he causes</b> the groom <b>to rejoice? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He is privileged</b> to acquire <b>the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [<i>kolot</i>], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Exodus 19:16). The plural <i>kolot</i> indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more. The passage continues: <b>“And when the voice of the <i>shofar</i></b> grew louder and louder, Moses spoke <b>and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). Along with the three previous voices, the second shofar and the voice with which God answered Moses amount to a total of five voices at the revelation at Sinai. |
| Exodus 19:17 | As it is written: “And they stood at the nether part of the mount” | Avodah Zarah2b:15 | The Gemara provides the background for this claim: <b>As it is written: “And they stood at the nether part of the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:17), <b>and Rav Dimi bar Ḥama says:</b> The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain,</b> i.e., Mount Sinai, <b>above the Jews like a basin, and</b> He <b>said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there,</b> under the mountain, <b>will be your burial.</b> The nations of the world will claim that they too could have been coerced to accept the Torah. |
| Exodus 19:17 | and they stood at the lowermost part of the mount” | Shabbat 88a:5 | The Gemara cites additional homiletic interpretations on the topic of the revelation at Sinai. The Torah says, “And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; <b>and they stood at the lowermost part of the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:17). <b>Rabbi Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Ḥasa said:</b> the Jewish people actually stood beneath the mountain, and the verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain above</b> the Jews <b>like a tub, and said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there will be your burial. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From here</b> there is <b>a substantial caveat to</b> the obligation to fulfill the <b>Torah.</b> The Jewish people can claim that they were coerced into accepting the Torah, and it is therefore not binding. <b>Rava said: Even so, they again accepted it</b> willingly <b>in the time of Ahasuerus, as it is written:</b> “The Jews <b>ordained, and took upon them,</b> and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them” (Esther 9:27), and he taught: The Jews <b>ordained what they had already taken upon themselves</b> through coercion at Sinai. |
| Exodus 19:19 | from here: “Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice” | Arakhin 11a:20 | <b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, says</b> that the requirement for the Levites to sing in the Temple is derived <b>from here: “Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). |
| Exodus 19:19 | is not permitted to raise his voice louder than the reader? As it is stated: “Moses spoke, and God responded in a voice” | Berakhot 45a:8 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the translator</b> who translated the public Torah reading into Aramaic <b>is not permitted to raise his voice louder than the reader? As it is stated: “Moses spoke, and God responded in a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). This verse requires further consideration, as <b>there is no need for the verse to state: In a voice.</b> The phrase, in a voice, adds nothing. Rather, to <b>what</b> purpose <b>did the verse state: In a voice? In Moses’ voice,</b> i.e., in a voice no louder than Moses’ voice. This verse instructs subsequent generations that Torah readers and translators should keep their voices at an equal volume just as Moses transmitted God’s word to the people and their voices were equal in volume. |
| Exodus 19:19 | and God answered him by a voice” | Berakhot 6b:30 | <b>What is his reward if he causes</b> the groom <b>to rejoice? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He is privileged</b> to acquire <b>the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [<i>kolot</i>], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Exodus 19:16). The plural <i>kolot</i> indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more. The passage continues: <b>“And when the voice of the <i>shofar</i></b> grew louder and louder, Moses spoke <b>and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). Along with the three previous voices, the second shofar and the voice with which God answered Moses amount to a total of five voices at the revelation at Sinai. |
| Exodus 19:19 | and it is written there: “Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice” | Sotah 33a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Levites themselves</b> answered in Hebrew? The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“voice”</b> that appears here, in the portion of the blessings and curses, and the word <b>“voice”</b> in the verse that relates to <b>Moses. It is written here: “With a loud voice”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14), <b>and it is written there: “Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). <b>Just as there,</b> the Ten Commandments were stated <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here,</b> the Levites spoke <b>in the sacred tongue.</b> |
| Exodus 19:19 | Moses | Sotah 33b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>derive</b> that the Levites spoke in Hebrew <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“voice”</b> that is written with regard to the Levites (Deuteronomy 27:14) and the word “voice” in the verse about <b>Moses</b> (Exodus 19:19). The Gemara answers: <b>He learned</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“speak”</b> and <b>“speak”</b> from his teacher, and <b>he did not learn</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“voice”</b> and <b>“voice”</b> from his teacher. |
| Exodus 19:19 | it is stated: “Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice” | Sotah 42a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies an ambiguous point in the mishna: <b>What is it saying</b> when the mishna derives from the verse that the priest must address the people in Hebrew? The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The ruling is derived from a verbal analogy, <b>as it is stated</b> here: <b>“And speak”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:2), <b>and there,</b> concerning the giving of the Torah, <b>it is stated: “Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). <b>Just as there,</b> the voice spoke <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here,</b> the priest speaks <b>in the sacred tongue.</b> |
| Exodus 19:20 | But isn’t it written: “And God descended onto Mount Sinai” | Sukkah 5a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did the Divine Presence never descend below</b> ten handbreadths? <b>But isn’t it written: “And God descended onto Mount Sinai”</b> (Exodus 19:20)? <br>The Gemara answers: Although God descended below, He always remained <b>ten handbreadths above</b> the ground. Since from ten handbreadths and above it is a separate domain, in fact, the Divine Presence never descended to the domain of this world. <br>The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And on that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives”</b> (Zechariah 14:4)? The Gemara answers: Here, too, He will remain <b>ten handbreadths above</b> the ground. |
| Exodus 19:22 | “And let the priests also that come near to the Lord sanctify themselves, | Zevachim 115b:10 | Rav Ḥisda replied that with regard to the firstborn, it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: God said to Moses on Mount Sinai: <b>“And let the priests also that come near to the Lord sanctify themselves,</b> lest the Lord break forth upon them” (Exodus 19:22). In other words, they should separate themselves and not approach the mountain. This command was given one day after the burnt offerings and peace offerings were sacrificed in anticipation of the revelation at Sinai. With regard to this command, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: This</b> command is a reference to <b>the separation of</b> the <b>firstborn,</b> as they functioned as priests. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: This</b> command is a reference to <b>the separation of Nadav and Avihu,</b> who were priests. |
| Exodus 19:24 | early in the morning, as it is written: “Go descend and you shall ascend together with Aaron” | Shabbat 86a:6 | The Gemara explains the source of this opinion: <b>He ascended</b> Mount Sinai <b>early in the morning, as it is written: “And Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai,</b> as the Lord had commanded him” (Exodus 34:4). And <b>he descended</b> the mountain <b>early in the morning, as it is written: “Go descend and you shall ascend together with Aaron”</b> (Exodus 19:24). The Torah <b>juxtaposes descent to ascent</b> to establish that <b>just as</b> Moses’ <b>ascent</b> was <b>early in the morning, so too,</b> his <b>descent</b> was <b>early in the morning.</b> Moses told the people to separate in the early morning so that there would be five complete periods of separation over the course of the three days. |
| Exodus 20:1 | said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, Blessed be He, as it is written: “And God spoke all these words” | Chagigah 3b:4 | <b>Lest a person say: Now, how can I study Torah</b> when it contains so many different opinions? <b>The verse states</b> that <b>they are all “given from one shepherd.” One God gave them; one leader,</b> i.e., Moses, <b>said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, Blessed be He, as it is written: “And God spoke all these words”</b> (Exodus 20:1). The plural form “words” indicates that God transmitted all the interpretations of the Ten Commandments. Since the Sages invariably utilize the Torah itself or the statements of the prophets as the sources for their opinions, there is a certain unity to the study of Torah, despite the numerous explanations and applications. |
| Exodus 20:2 | it is written in the Torah: “I am the Lord your God” | Gittin 57b:14 | <b>And Rav Yehuda said: This</b> verse applies to the <b>woman and her seven sons</b> who died as martyrs for the sake of the sanctification of God’s name. The incident occurred as follows: <b>They brought</b> in <b>the first</b> of the woman’s sons <b>before the emperor</b> and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “I am the Lord your God”</b> (Exodus 20:2). <b>They</b> immediately <b>took him out and killed him.</b> |

It <b>is not stated: The word of Your mouth,</b> in the singular. <b>Rather,</b> the verse uses the expression: <b>“The words of Your mouth,”</b> in the plural. To what is this phrase referring? <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “I am</b> the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), <b>and,</b> in the same verse: <b>“You shall have no</b> other gods before Me,” <b>the nations of the world said: He teaches</b> this <b>for His own honor,</b> as both statements entail respect for God. |

| Exodus 20:3 | in the lower heaven? Isn’t it taught | Rosh Hashanah24b:6 | The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>those</b> bodies found <b>in the lower heaven? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “You shall not make for yourself any graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:3). The phrase <b>“that is in heaven”</b> comes <b>to include</b> the <b>sun,</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars, and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> The term <b>“above”</b> serves <b>to include the ministering angels.</b> Apparently, it is prohibited to form an image even of the celestial bodies found in the lower Heaven. The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is in reference to the prohibition <b>against worshipping them.</b> However, there is no prohibition against forming an image in their likeness. |
| Exodus 20:3 | and: “You shall not have | Sanhedrin 107b:6 | <b>What did he do</b> that caused the masses to sin? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he hung a magnetic rock on Jeroboam’s sin,</b> i.e., on the golden calf that Jeroboam established as an idol, so that <b>he suspended it between heaven and earth,</b> i.e., he caused it to hover above the ground.

| Exodus 20:4 | that are in the lower heaven? But isn’t it taught | Avodah Zarah43b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to fashion figures of those bodies <b>that are in the lower heaven? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “You shall not make for yourself any graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:4): The phrase <b>“that is in heaven”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b>sun, and</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars, and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> The term <b>“above”</b> serves <b>to include the ministering angels.</b> Apparently, it is prohibited to fashion a figure even of the celestial bodies that are in the lower heaven. |
| Exodus 20:4 | as it is written: “You shall not make yourself a graven image” | Sanhedrin 61a:15 | The Gemara explains: In a case <b>where</b> those to whom the inciter spoke subsequently <b>worshiped</b> him, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the inciter is liable, <b>as it is written: “You shall not make yourself a graven image”</b> (Exodus 20:4), which is interpreted to include a case where one establishes himself as a god. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where the incident ended <b>in mere speech. Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>speech is</b> a significant <b>matter,</b> and therefore the inciter is liable for incitement, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>speech is nothing.</b> Therefore, the contradiction between the <i>mishnayot</i> can be resolved by attributing each mishna to a different <i>tanna</i>. |
| Exodus 20:5 | nor shall you serve them” | Avodah Zarah54a:4 | <b>Rather, Rava says: All</b> cases of idol worship <b>were included in</b> the prohibition: “You shall not bow down to them, <b>nor shall you serve them”</b> (Exodus 20:5), including the case of worship under duress. <b>When the verse specified to you:</b> “You shall keep My statutes…which a man shall do <b>and live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), <b>and not that he should die by them,</b> the verse <b>excluded</b> the case of <b>duress.</b> One would conclude from the verse that one who acts under duress is not considered an idol worshipper, and he is not required to sacrifice his life to refrain from worshipping idols. |
| Exodus 20:5 | where they do not adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own, | Berakhot 7a:27 | The Gemara <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> verse from Exodus, which states that God punishes descendants for the transgressions of their ancestors, refers to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own. While this</b> verse from Deuteronomy, which states that descendants are not punished for the actions of their ancestors, refers to a case <b>where they do not adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own,</b> as it is stated: “I visit iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and fourth generations of my enemies” (Exodus 20:5). |
| Exodus 20:5 | “You shall not bow to them | Sanhedrin 61b:20 | <b>Abaye</b> attempts to cite another proof for his opinion. He <b>said: From where do I say</b> that one who worships idols due to love or fear is liable? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall not bow to them</b> nor worship them” (Exodus 20:5): <b>“To them,”</b> to idols, <b>you may not bow, but you may bow to a person like yourself;</b> bowing to a person is merely the acceptance of authority. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is permitted to bow <b>even</b> to a person who <b>is worshipped</b> like a god, <b>like Haman;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Nor worship them,”</b> i.e., any form of pagan worship is prohibited. Abaye concludes: <b>And wasn’t Haman worshipped due to fear,</b> and not because the people considered him a god? Evidently, one who engages in idol worship due to fear is liable. |
| Exodus 20:5 | bowing, | Sanhedrin 62a:9 | Rabbi Abba concludes: <b>According to the one who says</b> that of all the labors that are prohibited on Shabbat, <b>kindling</b> a fire on Shabbat <b>was singled out</b> to be mentioned in the Torah <b>to</b> teach that it is an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> then <b>bowing,</b> in the category of idol worship, which is mentioned explicitly in the verse: “You shall not bow to them nor worship them” (Exodus 20:5), <b>was also singled out to</b> teach that it is an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> which is not punishable by stoning. |
| Exodus 20:5 | Rabbi Ami? The verse states: “Nor worship them” | Sanhedrin 63a:1 | <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> If one <b>sacrificed</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering <b>and burned</b> incense <b>and poured a libation,</b> all <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness, he is obligated</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering. <b>Abaye says: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami? The verse states: “Nor worship them”</b> (Exodus 20:5). <b>The verse renders all</b> the various rites of worship as <b>one rite.</b> |
| Exodus 20:5 | idol worship? | Sanhedrin 63a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Abaye</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Abaye say: Why</b> are there <b>three</b> mentions in the Torah of the prohibition against <b>bowing to</b> an object of <b>idol worship?</b> The prohibition against bowing to an idol appears three times: “You shall not bow to them nor worship them” (Exodus 20:5), “You shall not bow to their gods nor worship them” (Exodus 23:24), and “For you shall bow to no other god” (Exodus 34:14). |
| Exodus 20:5 | here it is written: “And showing mercy unto thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments” | Sotah 31a:9 | Proof of this assertion is that <b>here it is written: “And showing mercy unto thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments”</b> (Exodus 20:5), indicating that merits can last for thousands of generations for those who act out of love, <b>and there it is written:</b> “Know therefore that the Lord your God, He is God; the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and mercy with those who love Him <b>and keep His commandments for a thousand generations”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:9). The first verse indicates that those who act out of love retain their merits for thousands of generations, whereas the second verse, which mentions only one thousand generations of merit, is referring to the merits of those who keep God’s mitzvot out of fear. |
| Exodus 20:6 | than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “You shall not take [ tissa ] the name of the Lord your God | Chagigah 14a:16 | <b>What is</b> the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“And this stumbling block”</b> (Isaiah 3:6)? <b>Things that people cannot grasp unless they have stumbled over them,</b> as they can be understood only with much effort, <b>are under your hand. Although</b> they will approach an individual with these statements, he <b>“shall swear that day, saying: I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak; you shall not make me ruler of a people”</b> (Isaiah 3:7). When the verse states: <b>“Shall swear [<i>yissa</i>],” <i>yissa</i> is none</b> other <b>than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “You shall not take [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord your God</b> in vain” (Exodus 20:6). Therefore, the inhabitant of Jerusalem swears: <b>“I will not be a healer [<i>ḥovesh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 3:7), which means: <b>I was never</b> one <b>of those who sit [<i>meḥovshei</i>] in the study hall; “for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak,” as I possess</b> knowledge of <b>neither</b> the <b>Bible, nor Mishna, nor Gemara.</b> This shows that even at Jerusalem’s lowest spiritual ebb, its inhabitants would admit the truth and own up to their complete ignorance. |
| Exodus 20:6 | because it is written with regard to an oath: “The Lord will not hold guiltless | Nedarim 18a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> stated that an oath is more stringent than a vow. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the stringency of an oath vis-à-vis a vow,</b> such as a vow of naziriteship? <b>If we say</b> the <i>baraita</i> posits this <b>because</b> an oath, unlike a vow, <b>takes effect even with regard to a matter that has no actual</b> substance, there is a counterargument that <b>a vow also has stringency</b> vis-à-vis an oath, <b>in that it,</b> unlike an oath, <b>takes effect with regard to a mitzva just as</b> it does with regard to a matter that is <b>permitted. Rather,</b> oaths are more stringent <b>because it is written with regard to an oath: “The Lord will not hold guiltless</b> he who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:6). |
| Exodus 20:6 | the verses states: “Will not absolve” | Yoma 86a:3 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from a different source that was taught: <b>Since it was stated at Horeb</b> with regard to <b>repentance: “Absolve,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> the transgression of: <b>“You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” is included <b>among them;</b> therefore, <b>the verses states: “Will not absolve”</b> (Exodus 20:6). One <b>might</b> have thought this is <b>also</b> true <b>for those who are liable</b> for violating <b>all other prohibitions;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “His name.”</b> God <b>does not absolve the one</b> who disrespects <b>His name, but He absolves those who are liable</b> for violating <b>all other prohibitions</b> and repent. This is proof that those who violate all other prohibitions are not comparable to one who violates: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” |
| Exodus 20:7 | “Do not take | Berakhot 33a:35 | <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> apparently <b>self-contradictory.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said that one who recites <i>havdala</i> in the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> is <b>more praiseworthy than one who recites <i>havdala</i> over the cup</b> of wine, indicating that reciting <i>havdala</i> in <b>the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer alone is sufficient. And then it is taught: If one recited <i>havdala</i> in this,</b> the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>and that,</b> over the cup of wine, <b>may blessings rest upon his head. And since he fulfilled</b> his obligation to recite <i>havdala</i> <b>with one,</b> he is <b>exempt, and</b> the additional recitation of <i>havdala</i> over the cup of wine <b>is an unnecessary blessing. And Rav, and some say Reish Lakish, and</b> still others <b>say Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both said: Anyone who recites an unnecessary blessing violates</b> the biblical prohibition: <b>“Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7). |
| Exodus 20:7 | “Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it” | Pesachim 106a:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:7): <b>Remember it over wine,</b> through the recitation of <i>kiddush</i>. <b>I have only</b> derived that there is a mitzva to recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>during the day,</b> as the verse is referring to the day of Shabbat. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one must also recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night? The verse states: “Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it,”</b> which indicates that one should also remember Shabbat as soon as it is sanctified. |
| Exodus 20:7 | is written in it? “Do not take | Shabbat 89a:1 | <b>idols</b> that you require this special warning? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you perform labor that you require rest</b> from it? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? “Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely. Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you have a father or a mother</b> that would render the commandment to honor them relevant to you? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> God said to him: <b>“You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13) Moses asked the angels: <b>Is there jealousy among you,</b> or <b>is there an evil inclination within you</b> that would render these commandments relevant? <b>Immediately they agreed with the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that He made the right decision to give the Torah to the people, and <b>as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth”</b> (Psalms 8:10), <b>while “that Your majesty is placed above the heavens” is not written</b> because the angels agreed with God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on earth. |
| Exodus 20:7 | will not absolve of guilt | Shevuot 20b:13 | The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> state that one is flogged for either type of oath? Isn’t it <b>obvious? This is a prohibition and that is a prohibition,</b> and for both one is liable to receive lashes. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say as Rav Pappa said to Abaye,</b> that the verse: “For the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7), might indicate that God will not absolve him <b>at all,</b> and even if he is punished he cannot atone for his sin, |
| Exodus 20:7 | from here: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; | Shevuot 20b:6 | § <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> relating to the future, and does not fulfill it, it is <b>a false</b> oath. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> relating to past actions, and it is a lie, it is an oath taken <b>in vain, and its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain;</b> for the Lord will not absolve of guilt he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). |
| Exodus 20:7 | will not absolve of guilt | Shevuot 21a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one who <b>takes an oath</b> that is not true is flogged? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The verse states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for</b> the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). It is the <b>heavenly court</b> that <b>does not absolve him; but the earthly court flogs him, and</b> in doing so, <b>absolves him of guilt.</b> |
| Exodus 20:7 | Sinai: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain, | Shevuot 39a:1 | <b>that the entire world trembled when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said at</b> Mount <b>Sinai: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain,</b> for the Lord will not hold guiltless one who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). |
| Exodus 20:7 | the verse states: “For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain” | Temurah 3a:19 | The Gemara discusses the sources for these exceptions. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>one who takes an oath</b> using the name of God is flogged? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir</b> that <b>the verse states: “For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain”</b> (Exodus 20:7). One can infer: <b>The higher,</b> i.e., heavenly, <b>court</b> |
| Exodus 20:7 | Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says | Temurah 3b:3 | § The Gemara continues: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one who takes <b>an oath in vain</b> using the name of God is flogged. <b>From where do we</b> derive that the same holds for <b>a false oath?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself says</b> the derivation: The verse states with regard to an oath taken in vain: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). It says: <b>“In vain…in vain,” twice</b> in this verse. <b>If</b> the second instance of the term <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matter of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> which is derived from the first instance, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a false oath,</b> to teach <b>that</b> one who takes such an oath <b>is flogged.</b> |
| Exodus 20:7 | except for: “You shall not take | Yoma 86a:1 | <b>except for: “You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” (Exodus 20:7), about which the Torah states: “For God will not absolve him who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The Gemara answers: It is not that this is the only negative mitzva that is not a minor transgression; rather, it is: <b>“You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” <b>and any</b> prohibition <b>similar to it,</b> meaning all severe prohibitions that carry punishment by a court. |
| Exodus 20:8 | as the verse states: “Remember the Shabbat day, to keep it holy” | Beitzah 15b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source of the <i>halakha</i> of the joining of cooked foods and of the <i>halakha</i> that one who failed to prepare such an <i>eiruv</i> may not cook on a Festival for Shabbat? <b>Shmuel said</b> that the source is <b>as the verse states: “Remember the Shabbat day, to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8); from which he infers: <b>Remember it</b> and safeguard it <b>from another</b> day <b>that comes to make it forgotten.</b> When a Festival occurs on Friday, preoccupation with the Festival and the preparation and enjoyment of its meals could lead one to overlook Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages instituted an ordinance to ensure that Shabbat will be remembered even then. |
| Exodus 20:8 | the verse said: “Remember | Berakhot 20b:10 | <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This has a unique explanation. In the Ten Commandments in the book of Exodus, <b>the verse said: “Remember</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Exodus 20:8), while in the book of Deuteronomy it is said: <b>“Observe</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Deuteronomy 5:12). From these two variants we can deduce that <b>anyone included in</b> the obligation to <b>observe</b> Shabbat by avoiding its desecration, <b>is</b> also <b>included in</b> the mitzva to <b>remember</b> Shabbat by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>Since these women are included in</b> the mitzva <b>to observe</b> Shabbat, as there is no distinction between men and women in the obligation to observe prohibitions in general and to refrain from the desecration of Shabbat in particular, so too <b>are they included in</b> the mitzva of <b>remembering</b> Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:8 | “Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it” | Pesachim 117b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And one must mention the exodus from Egypt in the <i>kiddush</i></b> of Shabbat day, despite the fact that Shabbat is not directly connected to the Exodus. The proof is that <b>here,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>it is written: “That you may remember the day</b> when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life” (Deuteronomy 16:3); <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). By means of a verbal analogy of the word “day,” these verses teach that one must also recall the Exodus on Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:8 | “Remember | Rosh Hashanah27a:2 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> there were <b>two trumpets,</b> one <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> of the person sounding the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But is it</b> really <b>possible to</b> properly <b>discern two</b> different <b>sounds,</b> that of the <i>shofar</i> and that of the trumpets, at the same time? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The two versions of the fifth of the Ten Commandments, <b>“Remember</b> the Shabbat day” (Exodus 20:8) and <b>“Keep</b> the Shabbat day” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken</b> by God simultaneously <b>in a single utterance, something that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot speak and the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear?</b> This indicates that it is impossible to take in two sounds at once, and so, due to the sound of the trumpets, it should be impossible to hear the blast of the <i>shofar</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>For this reason</b> they <b>would sound a long</b> blast <b>with the <i>shofar</i>,</b> to make it possible to hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i> on its own. |
| Exodus 20:8 | person cannot be discerned, | Rosh Hashanah27a:6 | <b>Rather,</b> we must retreat from the explanation offered above and say as follows: <b>Two sounds</b> coming <b>from one</b> source or <b>person cannot be discerned,</b> and this was the miracle at Sinai in which the people heard both “Remember the Shabbat” (Exodus 20:8) and “Keep the Shabbat” (Deuteronomy 5:12) in a single divine utterance. But two sounds <b>from two</b> different sources or <b>people can be</b> properly <b>discerned.</b> |
| Exodus 20:8 | corresponding to: “Remember | Shabbat 33b:8 | <b>As the sun was setting on Shabbat eve, they saw an elderly man who was holding two bundles of myrtle branches and running at twilight. They said to him: Why do you have these? He said to them: In honor of Shabbat.</b> They said to him: <b>And let one suffice.</b> He answered them: <b>One</b> is <b>corresponding to: “Remember</b> the Shabbat day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and</b> one is <b>corresponding to: “Observe</b> the Shabbat day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12). Rabbi Shimon <b>said to his son: See how beloved the mitzvot are to Israel. Their minds were</b> put <b>at ease</b> and they were no longer as upset that people were not engaged in Torah study. |
| Exodus 20:8 | “Remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy” | Shabbat 86b:5 | <b>The Sages taught: On the sixth</b> day <b>of the month</b> of Sivan, <b>the Ten Commandments were given to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says: On the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> the month. <b>Rava said: Everyone agrees</b> that the Jews <b>came to the Sinai desert on the New Moon,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, <b>the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai”</b> (Exodus 19:1), without elaborating what day it was. <b>And it is written there: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months;</b> it shall be the first month of the year to you” (Exodus 12:2). <b>Just as there,</b> the term “this” is referring to the <b>New Moon, so too, here</b> the term is referring to the <b>New Moon. And</b> similarly, <b>everyone agrees that the Torah was given to the Jewish people on Shabbat,</b> as <b>it is written here</b> in the Ten Commandments: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8), <b>and it is written there: “And Moses said to the people: Remember this day,</b> in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place; there shall be no leaven eaten” (Exodus 13:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of the Exodus, <b>so too, here</b> the mitzva of remembrance was commanded <b>on the very day</b> of Shabbat. <b>Where</b> Rabbi Yosei and the Sages <b>disagree</b> is <b>with regard to the determination of the month,</b> meaning which day of the week was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yosei held:</b> The <b>New Moon was established on the first day of the week, and on the first day of the week He did not say anything to them due to the weariness</b> caused by <b>the journey. On the second day of the week, He said to them: “And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests</b> and a holy nation; these are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:6). |
| Exodus 20:8 | “Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it” | Shabbat 89a:1 | <b>idols</b> that you require this special warning? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you perform labor that you require rest</b> from it? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? “Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely. Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12).

| Exodus 20:8 | “Remember | Shevuot 20b:9 | The Gemara answers: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case, of a false oath, is <b>as it is and that</b> case, of an oath taken in vain, is <b>as it is. What,</b> then, is the meaning of the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are one?</b> It is <b>that</b> both <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> at the giving of the Torah, <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remember</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and: “Observe</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken in one utterance,</b> in a manner <b>that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot say and that the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear.</b> |
| Exodus 20:9 | “You shall not perform any labor” | Pesachim 48a:12 | <b>He said to him: How can I accept it? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to their dispute: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>According to your statement, one violates</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9). Rabbi Eliezer could not respond to this claim <b>and was silent.</b> But <b>if it is</b> as Rami bar Ḥama explained, Rabbi Eliezer <b>should have said to him: The reason</b> for <b>my</b> opinion is <b>due to</b> the principle: <b>Since, etc.,</b> on the basis of which no prohibited labor has been performed. |
| Exodus 20:9 | you shall not perform any labor” | Shabbat 114b:6 | With regard to trimming vegetables on Yom Kippur, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said, and some say Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, trimming vegetables is prohibited. Rav Mana said: It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>],</b> a holy Shabbat unto the Lord” (Exodus 16:23), which means that there is an obligation to issue a <b>rabbinic prohibition</b> on this day. Issue a rabbinic prohibition <b>for what</b> activity? <b>If you say</b> this refers to prohibiting actual <b>labor, isn’t it written</b> explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9)? <b>Rather, does</b> it not refer to <b>trimming vegetables,</b> which is prohibited on Shabbat even though it is not a full-fledged prohibited labor? The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that trimming vegetables is prohibited. |
| Exodus 20:9 | you shall not perform any labor” | Shabbat 114b:7 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, trimming vegetables is permitted.</b> The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> from what we learned in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat trimming vegetables is prohibited? The verse states: “A solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>],</b> a holy Shabbat unto the Lord” (Exodus 16:23), which means that there is an obligation to issue a <b>rabbinic prohibition</b> on this day. Issue a rabbinic prohibition <b>for what</b> activity? <b>If you say</b> this refers to prohibiting actual <b>labor, isn’t it written</b> explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9)? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>trimming vegetables,</b> which is prohibited on Shabbat? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> that is not; rather, solemn rest <b>actually</b> refers <b>to labor.</b> It is a positive commandment to rest on Shabbat. Although the verse says explicitly: “But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God; you shall not perform any labor,” this adds that one who performs a prohibited labor <b>violates</b> both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition.</b> |
| Exodus 20:9 | you shall not perform any labor” | Shabbat 120b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so, here too,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>it is written:</b> “And the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God, <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:9). And here, too, one could derive: <b>Performance is that which is prohibited; indirectly causing</b> a prohibited action <b>is permitted.</b> The Gemara answers: Actually, Rabbi Yosei maintains there is no prohibition in indirectly causing a fire to be extinguished; however, <b>since a person is agitated about his property, if you permit him</b> to indirectly extinguish the fire, <b>he will come to extinguish</b> it directly. |
| Exodus 20:10 | is stated: “Your manservant, your maidservant, nor your cattle” | Bava Kamma54b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>concerning Shabbat</b> itself that the words “ox” and “donkey” are referring to all types of animals? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: In the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Your manservant, your maidservant, nor your cattle”</b> (Exodus 20:10), whereas <b>in the second</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:14). Now, <b>aren’t an ox and a donkey</b> already <b>included in</b> the category of: <b>All animals,</b> which are included in the term “cattle”? <b>Why,</b> then, were they <b>specified? To teach you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>ox and donkey that are stated here, undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them, so too,</b> everywhere that an ox and donkey are mentioned, <b>all</b> types of <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them.</b> |
| Exodus 20:10 | is from here: “You shall not perform any labor” | Pesachim 47b:10 | The Gemara asks: Is the prohibition against utilizing <b>set-aside</b> material prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, such that a person is flogged for violating this prohibition? <b>He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5). This verse teaches that anything that has not been prepared before the Festival is considered to be set-aside, and it is prohibited to utilize it. This verse indicates that utilizing set-aside objects is prohibited; however, it does not formulate this prohibition as a negative commandment. Therefore, the Gemara adds that <b>the warning</b> indicating that it is a negative commandment <b>is from here: “You shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:10). This general statement pertaining to Shabbat includes utilizing objects that were not set aside for use before Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:10 | you shall not perform any labor” | Shabbat 117b:8 | And <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one forgot bread in the oven and</b> did not remove it until <b>the day</b> of Shabbat <b>was sanctified, he may rescue</b> enough <b>food</b> for <b>three meals</b> from the oven. <b>And, one may say to others: Come and rescue</b> bread <b>for yourselves. And when one removes</b> the bread from the oven, <b>he may not remove</b> it in the usual manner <b>with a baker’s paddle, but</b> he removes it in an unusual manner, e.g., <b>with a knife.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> that it is stated: “And the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord, your God, <b>you shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:10), and the emphasis on the word labor <b>excludes blowing the shofar and removing bread, which is a skill and not a labor,</b> and which therefore is not prohibited on Shabbat. If by Torah law removing bread on Shabbat is permitted, why may one not remove it in the usual manner? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>as much as it is possible to alter</b> the manner in which one removes bread from the oven <b>one alters,</b> to emphasize that the day is Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:10 | Rava said that the verse states: “You shall not perform any manner of labor, neither you…nor your animal” | Shabbat 153b:12 | With regard to the topic of driving a donkey on Shabbat, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> With regard to <b>one who drives his</b> laden <b>animal on Shabbat,</b> if he does so <b>unwittingly, he is liable</b> to bring a <b>sin-offering,</b> and if he does so <b>intentionally, he is liable</b> to be executed by <b>stoning.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Rava said that the verse states: “You shall not perform any manner of labor, neither you…nor your animal”</b> (Exodus 20:10). From this he derived: <b>His animal</b> is <b>similar to himself; just as he,</b> if he performed a prohibited labor on Shabbat <b>unwittingly, he is liable</b> to bring a <b>sin-offering,</b> and if he did so <b>intentionally, he is liable</b> to be executed by <b>stoning, so too,</b> if he performed a prohibited labor by means of <b>his animal,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he is liable</b> to bring a <b>sin-offering,</b> and if he did so <b>intentionally, he is liable</b> to be executed by <b>stoning.</b> |
| Exodus 20:10 | you shall not perform any manner of labor, | Shabbat 153b:7 | We learned in the mishna that <b>the Master said:</b> When <b>there is no gentile with him, one places</b> the pouch <b>on the donkey.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t he</b> thereby <b>driving a</b> laden <b>animal? And the Torah stated:</b> “And the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God, <b>you shall not perform any manner of labor,</b> neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your slave, nor your maidservant, nor your animal, nor your stranger that is within your gates” (Exodus 20:10). He is causing the prohibited labors of carrying from domain to domain and of carrying in the public domain by placing the pouch on his donkey on Shabbat. |
| Exodus 20:11 | as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” | Ketubot 103a:26 | The Gemara clarifies the various requests that he made of his sons: <b>Be careful with the honor of your mother.</b> The Gemara asks: Why would he need to say this? After all, <b>this</b> is required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11)? The Gemara answers: <b>She was</b> their <b>father’s wife.</b> She was not their mother, but their stepmother, and he therefore needed to caution them concerning her honor. |
| Exodus 20:11 | it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother” | Kiddushin 30b:18 | <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9). In this manner, <b>the verse equates the honor of one’s father and mother to the honor of the Omnipresent,</b> as the term “honor” is used in both cases. |
| Exodus 20:11 | Therefore, | Kiddushin 31a:1 | <b>she persuades him with</b> many <b>statements</b> of encouragement and does not treat him harshly. <b>Therefore,</b> in the mitzva of: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:11), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>the honor</b> due one’s <b>father before</b> mentioning the <b>honor</b> due one’s <b>mother.</b> The verse emphasizes the duty that does not come naturally. Similarly, <b>it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son fears his father more than his mother, because</b> his father <b>teaches him Torah,</b> and consequently he is strict with him. <b>Therefore,</b> in the verse: “A man shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>fear of the mother before</b> the mention of <b>fear of the father.</b> |
| Exodus 20:11 | Once He said: “Honor your father and your mother” | Kiddushin 31a:7 | <b>Once He said: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>they returned and conceded</b> the truth <b>of the first statements,</b> which is why the verse uses the plural expression: “Words of Your mouth,” i.e., all the words of God’s mouth. <b>Rava said:</b> This can be derived <b>from here: “The beginning of Your word is truth”</b> (Psalms 119:160). Is <b>the beginning of Your word</b> truth <b>but not the end of Your word? Rather, from the end of Your word it is apparent</b> to everyone <b>that the beginning of Your word is truth.</b> |
| Exodus 20:11 | It is stated: “Honor your father and your mother” | Kiddushin 32a:2 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), which teaches the following verbal analogy: <b>Just as there</b> one honors God “with your wealth,” i.e., <b>through monetary loss, so too here</b> one must honor his father <b>through monetary loss. And if you say</b> that one honors him <b>from</b> the money of <b>the father, what difference</b> does it make <b>to</b> the son, i.e., what monetary loss does he suffer? The Gemara answers: It makes a difference to him with regard <b>to</b> the <b>neglect of</b> his <b>work.</b> Although he is not required to spend his own money, the son must leave aside his work to honor his father, which will cause him some financial loss. |
| Exodus 20:12 | a positive mitzva, | Bava Metzia32a:15 | The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that a priest must not obey his father’s command to become impure is <b>because the Merciful One writes: “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>;</b> I am the Lord”; <b>but</b> if <b>it were not so, I would say</b> that the child <b>must obey him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why? This</b> obligation to obey a parent is <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12), <b>and that</b> obligation of a priest to refrain from becoming impure is both <b>a prohibition:</b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva:</b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2); <b>and</b> the principle is that <b>a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b> |
| Exodus 20:12 | enter your mind to say: Since honoring one’s father and mother is equated to the honor of the Omnipresent, as it is stated here: “Honor your father and your mother” | Bava Metzia32a:16 | The Gemara answers that the derivation from “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>; I am the Lord” <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since honoring one’s father and mother is equated to the honor of the Omnipresent, as it is stated here: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12), <b>and it is stated elsewhere: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), <b>therefore,</b> one might have thought that the priest must <b>obey his</b> father’s command to become impure. Therefore the Torah <b>teaches us that</b> the priest is commanded <b>not to listen to him.</b> |
| Exodus 20:12 | everywhere | Keritot 28a:29 | Likewise, mention of <b>the father precedes</b> that of <b>the mother</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12). One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the honor of the father takes precedence over the honor of the mother.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Every man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), with the order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal. But the Sages said:</b> Honor of <b>the father takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the mother everywhere, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his mother are obligated in the honor of his father.</b> |
| Exodus 20:12 | “Honor your father and your mother” | Shabbat 89a:1 | <b>idols</b> that you require this special warning? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you perform labor that you require rest</b> from it? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? “Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely. Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you have a father or a mother</b> that would render the commandment to honor them relevant to you? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> God said to him: <b>“You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13) Moses asked the angels: <b>Is there jealousy among you,</b> or <b>is there an evil inclination within you</b> that would render these commandments relevant? <b>Immediately they agreed with the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that He made the right decision to give the Torah to the people, and <b>as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth”</b> (Psalms 8:10), <b>while “that Your majesty is placed above the heavens” is not written</b> because the angels agreed with God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on earth. |
| Exodus 20:13 | are flogged | Bava Kamma74b:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>It may be concluded</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says they are not killed. As Rabbi Elazar says: Witnesses who were contradicted in</b> a case involving the taking of <b>a life,</b> i.e., a capital case, <b>are flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13). |
| Exodus 20:13 | lashes, | Ketubot 32a:6 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara states that Ulla <b>derives</b> this principle <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of false, <b>conspiring witnesses. Just as</b> with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses, where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money,</b> if they falsely testified to render one liable for payment, <b>and</b> receive <b>lashes,</b> for violating the prohibition “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13), and the <i>halakha</i> is that one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged, so too,</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes,</b> one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged.</b> |
| Exodus 20:13 | payment. | Ketubot 32b:5 | The Gemara answers that the fact that conspiring witnesses pay money can be explained <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rabbi Ile’a said</b> in a different context: <b>The Torah explicitly amplified</b> the case of <b>conspiring witnesses</b> to include liability <b>for payment.</b> The Torah employed language indicating that conspiring witnesses who testified falsely in order to render one liable for payment must pay the sum and are not flogged. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to injury, <b>the Torah explicitly amplified</b> the case of <b>one who injures another</b> to include liability <b>for payment.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And where is this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ile’a stated?</b> The Gemara answers that it is stated <b>concerning this</b> mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 4a). If witnesses said: <b>We testify that so-and-so owes another two hundred dinar, and</b> these witnesses <b>were discovered</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses; <b>they are flogged and pay, as the source [<i>shem</i>] that brings them to</b> liability to receive <b>lashes does not bring them to</b> liability for <b>payment.</b> Each liability has an independent source; the source for lashes is: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” (Exodus 20:13) while the source for payment is: “You shall do unto him as he conspired” (Deuteronomy 19:19). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Anyone who pays is not flogged.</b> |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not bear | Makkot 2b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that conspiring witnesses are liable to receive lashes <b>from</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not bear</b> false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13)? The Gemara answers: One is not flogged for violating that prohibition, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as one violates it through speech, not action, <b>and</b> the principle is: For <b>every prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. Therefore, it was necessary to derive the <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “And they vindicated the righteous.” |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” | Makkot 4a:12 | Likewise, if witnesses said: <b>We testify with regard to a man</b> called <b>so-and-so that he is liable</b> to receive <b>forty lashes, and they were discovered</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>they are flogged</b> with <b>eighty</b> lashes; one set of lashes <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor”</b> (Exodus 20:13), <b>and</b> one set of lashes <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), which is the punishment for conspiring witnesses; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are flogged</b> with <b>only forty</b> lashes, due to the verse “And you shall do to him as he conspired.” |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not commit adultery” | Niddah 13b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says,</b> with regard to the severity of this transgression: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; even when you make many prayers, I will not hear; <b>your hands are full of blood”</b> (Isaiah 1:15)? <b>These are</b> those men <b>who commit adultery with the hand,</b> by masturbating. Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When it is stated in the Ten Commandments: <b>“You shall not commit adultery”</b> (Exodus 20:13), this means that <b>there shall not be adultery among you, whether</b> you masturbate <b>by hand</b> or <b>whether with</b> one’s <b>foot.</b> |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not testify | Sanhedrin 10a:10 | The Gemara asks: Why does this <i>halakha</i> require a specific derivation? <b>But</b> since there is a principle that one is subject to lashes for violating any prohibition, why not <b>derive</b> this punishment <b>from</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not testify</b> as a false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13)? The Gemara answers: That verse is insufficient, <b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> but only speech, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> one <b>is not flogged for it.</b> |
| Exodus 20:13 | then repeat | Sanhedrin 59b:6 | The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>is saying:</b> After stating <b>a prohibition</b> with regard to the descendants of Noah, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to <b>then repeat</b> the prohibition itself for the Jewish people? If the only purpose is to teach an additional <i>halakha</i>, it is unnecessary to repeat it in the form of a prohibition, e.g., “You shall not murder…you shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:13). Therefore, it is derived from the fact that the entire prohibition is repeated, and not just the new details, that it applies both to Jews and to descendants of Noah. |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not steal” | Sanhedrin 86a:15 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is <b>a prohibition against abducting a person</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“They shall not be sold as slaves”</b> (Leviticus 25:42). The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree,</b> as each requires both verses to derive the prohibition. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>enumerates</b> the <b>prohibition against abduction, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>enumerates</b> the <b>prohibition against selling</b> the abductee into slavery. |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not steal” | Sanhedrin 86a:16 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13), and it is <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>abducts people</b> that <b>the verse is speaking. Do you say</b> that the verse is speaking <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>abducts people, or</b> perhaps the verse is speaking <b>only with regard to</b> one who <b>steals property? You say: Go out and learn from</b> one of <b>the thirteen hermeneutical principles: A matter derived from its context. With regard to what</b> context are the adjacent prohibitions “You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery” in <b>the verse speaking?</b> They are speaking <b>with regard to capital</b> cases. <b>So too here,</b> the prohibition is speaking <b>with regard to a capital</b> case of abduction. |
| Exodus 20:13 | “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal” | Shabbat 89a:1 | <b>idols</b> that you require this special warning? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you perform labor that you require rest</b> from it? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it? “Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely. Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>“Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12). Moses asked the angels: <b>Do you have a father or a mother</b> that would render the commandment to honor them relevant to you? <b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>What</b> else <b>is written in it?</b> God said to him: <b>“You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal”</b> (Exodus 20:13) Moses asked the angels: <b>Is there jealousy among you,</b> or <b>is there an evil inclination within you</b> that would render these commandments relevant? <b>Immediately they agreed with the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that He made the right decision to give the Torah to the people, and <b>as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth”</b> (Psalms 8:10), <b>while “that Your majesty is placed above the heavens” is not written</b> because the angels agreed with God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on earth. |
| Exodus 20:13 | the Merciful One states: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” | Shevuot 31a:6 | The Gemara asks: Is it from the verse <b>“Distance yourself from a false matter” that this</b> matter <b>is derived? But</b> isn’t <b>he certainly lying</b> in that case, <b>and</b> this is already stated, as <b>the Merciful One states: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor”</b> (Exodus 20:13)? <b>Rather,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the teacher <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>certain</b> that <b>I have one witness, and you come</b> and <b>stand there</b> beside him <b>and do not say anything, as</b> in that manner <b>you do not express a lie from your mouth.</b> Your silent presence will create the impression that I have two witnesses and lead the debtor to admit his debt. <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to do this, <b>due to that</b> which <b>is stated: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b> |
| Exodus 20:13 | The verse states: “You shall not commit adultery [ lo tinaf ]” | Shevuot 47b:4 | Since this Sage was mentioned, the Gemara cites some of his other statements. <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says:</b> With regard to the <b>prohibition of following after an adulterer,</b> i.e., providing him with assistance in carrying out adultery, <b>from where</b> is it derived? <b>The verse states: “You shall not commit adultery [<i>lo tinaf</i> ]”</b> (Exodus 20:13). If the verse is vocalized slightly differently, it may be read: <b>You shall not cause adultery [<i>lo tanif</i> ].</b> |
| Exodus 20:14 | violate the prohibition of: “You shall not covet | Bava Metzia5b:19 | <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But</b> by paying for the deposit instead of returning it, <b>doesn’t</b> the bailee <b>violate the prohibition of: “You shall not covet</b> your neighbor’s wife, nor his slave, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s” (Exodus 20:14)? One transgresses this prohibition by taking an item from another by force or deceit, even if one pays for it. |
| Exodus 20:15 | Is this so? Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices | Berakhot 6b:31 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Isn’t it also written: “And the whole nation saw the voices</b> and the torches and the sound of the shofar” (Exodus 20:15)? Clearly more than five voices are mentioned with regard to the revelation at Sinai. |
| Exodus 20:17 | “That His fear may be upon your faces” | Nedarim 20a:12 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“That His fear may be upon your faces”</b> (Exodus 20:17); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>shame,</b> as shame causes one to blush. <b>“That you not sin”</b> (Exodus 20:17) <b>teaches that shame leads to fear of sin. From here</b> the Sages <b>said: It is a good sign in a person that he is one who experiences shame. Others say: Any person who experiences shame will not quickly sin, and</b> conversely, <b>one who does not have</b> the capacity to be <b>shamefaced, it is known that his forefathers did not stand at Mount Sinai.</b> |
| Exodus 20:17 | The term rise [ yissa ] means nothing other than an oath, as it says: “Do not raise [ tissa ] the name of the Lord | Shabbat 120a:1 | <b>Matters</b> of Torah <b>that people do not ascertain unless they misunderstand them are in your hands;</b> therefore, <b>be a chief over us.</b> It is stated later on in that passage: <b>“He will rise [<i>yissa</i>] on that day, saying, I will not be a ruler</b> while in my house there is no bread and no garment, you shall not appoint me as chief of the people” (Isaiah 3:7). <b>The term rise [<i>yissa</i>] means nothing other than an oath, as it says: “Do not raise [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord</b> your God in vain” (Exodus 20:17). <b>I will not be a ruler,</b> means: <b>I will not be one of those who close themselves up in the study hall,</b> as I do not regularly do so, <b>while in my house there is no bread and no garment, for I have neither Bible nor Mishna nor Gemara in my hands.</b> According to this explanation, there were people of faith who truthfully admitted that they did not study Torah, even during the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. The Gemara rejects this: <b>And from what</b> do you conclude that this admission was due to their faithfulness? <b>Perhaps it is different</b> in that case, <b>as had he told them: I studied</b> Torah, <b>they would have said to him: Tell us</b> what you studied. As he would not know to respond, he would have no choice other than to admit that he did not study. The Gemara rejects this: That is not difficult, as <b>he could have</b> at least <b>said he learned and forgot.</b> The Gemara asks: Therefore, <b>what</b> is: <b>I will not be a ruler?</b> It means that he is telling the truth and although he could have lied, he admits that he did <b>not</b> study Torah <b>at all.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where it was taught that they were faithful, that was <b>with regard to matters of Torah;</b> whereas <b>here,</b> where it was taught that there were no more people of faith in Jerusalem, that was <b>with regard to</b> matters of <b>business.</b> |
| Exodus 20:17 | shamefaced, as it is written: “And that His fear shall be upon your faces” | Yevamot 79a:3 | David <b>said: There are three distinguishing marks of this nation,</b> the Jewish people. They are <b>merciful,</b> they are <b>shamefaced, and they perform acts of kindness.</b> <br>They are <b>merciful, as it is written: “And He will give you mercy, and have mercy upon you and multiply you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18); not only will God have mercy upon you, but He will bestow the attribute of mercy upon you. <br>They are <b>shamefaced, as it is written: “And that His fear shall be upon your faces”</b> (Exodus 20:17), and the fear that is on one’s face is his shame. <br><b>They perform acts of kindness, as it is written:</b> “For I have known him, <b>to the end that he may command his children and his household</b> after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to practice righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19), i.e., to perform acts of kindness. <br><b>Whoever has these three distinguishing marks is fit to cleave to this nation.</b> Those who lack these qualities, however, are unfit to be part of the Jewish people. When David saw the cruelty of the Gibeonites, he decreed that they may never enter into the congregation of Israel. |
| Exodus 20:19 | “You shall not make with Me | Rosh Hashanah24b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> really <b>permitted</b> to form images of <b>those attendants</b> concerning <b>which it is impossible to reproduce their likeness? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19), comes to teach: <b>You shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me on high.</b> Apparently, this includes the sun and the moon. <b>Abaye said:</b> This does not include the sun and the moon, as <b>the Torah prohibited only</b> the fashioning of <b>an image of</b> all <b>four faces</b> of the creatures of the Heavenly Chariot <b>together</b> (see Ezekiel, chapter 1). However, all other images, which are not the likeness of the ministering angels, are permitted. |
| Exodus 20:19 | “You shall not make with Me [ iti ]” | Rosh Hashanah24b:4 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, let</b> the fashioning of an image of <b>a human face [<i>partzuf</i> ] alone be permitted. Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All faces are permitted</b> for ornamental purposes, <b>except for the face of a person? Rav Huna, son of Rav Idi, said: From a lecture of Abaye I heard</b> that there is a different reason why one may not form an image of a human face, as the verse states: <b>“You shall not make with Me [<i>iti</i>]”</b> (Exodus 20:19). This can be read as: <b>You shall not make Me [<i>oti</i>].</b> Since man is created in the image of God, it is prohibited to form an image of a human being. |
| Exodus 20:19 | “You shall not make with Me | Rosh Hashanah24b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>other attendants? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19), teaches that <b>you shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me on high, for example, <i>ofanim</i> and seraphim and the sacred <i>ḥayyot</i> and the ministering angels. Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> those <b>attendants that are</b> found <b>in the upper Heaven,</b> i.e., the supreme angels in the highest firmament, but not the celestial bodies, e.g., the sun and the moon, despite the fact that they too are located in heaven. |
| Exodus 20:19 | “You shall not make with Me | Rosh Hashanah24b:8 | The Gemara raises yet another objection: <b>And is the mere fashioning</b> of images of the celestial bodies <b>permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19). This verse teaches that <b>you shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me, for example</b> the <b>sun,</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> This is explicit proof that it is prohibited to form images of the sun and the moon; consequently, the solution proposed by Abaye is rejected, leaving the difficulty with Rabban Gamliel’s diagram unresolved. |
| Exodus 20:20 | constellations permitted? But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me | Avodah Zarah42b:15 | <b>The Master said:</b> Figures of <b>all constellations are permitted, except for</b> the following <b>celestial objects: The sun and the moon.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with here? If we say</b> that the reference is <b>to one who forms</b> these figures, i.e., <b>if</b> Rav Sheshet is discussing the issue <b>of</b> which figures it is permitted to <b>form, is</b> forming figures of <b>all the</b> other <b>constellations permitted? But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make for you” (Exodus 20:20)? This verse is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies, including the constellations, that were created to serve God. |
| Exodus 20:20 | of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, | Avodah Zarah42b:18 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara concludes, it is <b>obvious</b> that the statement that the figure of a human face is forbidden is referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> a figure, <b>and</b> this is prohibited, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who states (43b) that the interpretation of the verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make for you” (Exodus 20:20), is: Do not make of Me, i.e., do not form the figure of a person, who was created in the image of God. |
| Exodus 20:20 | But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me | Avodah Zarah43a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> it <b>permitted</b> to form these figures? <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold” (Exodus 20:20), which is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies that were created to serve God, including the sun and the moon. |
| Exodus 20:20 | “You shall not make with Me | Avodah Zarah43a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> actually <b>permitted</b> to fashion figures of those <b>attendants</b> of God concerning <b>which it is impossible to reproduce their likeness? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:20), is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high?</b> Apparently, this includes the sun and the moon. |
| Exodus 20:20 | “You shall not make with Me [ iti ]” | Avodah Zarah43b:3 | <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I heard in a lecture of Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that there is a different reason why one may not fashion a figure of a human face; the verse states: <b>“You shall not make with Me [<i>iti</i>]”</b> (Exodus 20:20). This can be read as: <b>You shall not make Me [<i>oti</i>].</b> Since the human being was created in the image of God (see Genesis 1:27), it is prohibited to fashion an image of a human being. <b>But</b> fashioning figures of <b>other attendants</b> of God is <b>permitted.</b> |
| Exodus 20:20 | “You shall not make with Me | Avodah Zarah43b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to fashion figures of <b>other attendants</b> of God? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:20), is interpreted to mean that <b>you shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high, for example, <i>ofanim</i>, and seraphim, and the sacred <i>ḥayyot</i>, and the ministering angels?</b> |
| Exodus 20:20 | “You shall not make with Me | Avodah Zarah43b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is the mere fashioning</b> of figures of the celestial bodies <b>permitted? But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:20), is interpreted to mean that <b>you shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high, for example:</b> The <b>sun, and</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars, and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> This is proof that it is prohibited to fashion figures of the sun and the moon.

| Exodus 20:20 | where he erred with regard to this verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold, | Keritot 3b:3 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> this ruling is stated <b>with regard to an adult,</b> i.e., one who was not captured by gentiles as a child, and it is speaking of a case <b>where he erred with regard to this verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold,</b> you shall not make for yourselves” (Exodus 20:20). This person <b>thinks</b> that <b>when bowing</b> to an idol is <b>prohibited</b> it applies only <b>to</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> fashioned <b>of silver or gold; but</b> with regard to objects fashioned <b>of other substances,</b> such as wood or stone, it is <b>permitted. And that is</b> a case of an action that is <b>unwitting with regard to idol worship but intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>rites.</b> |
| Exodus 20:20 | Isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me | Rosh Hashanah24a:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to create these types of forms? <b>Isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold” (Exodus 20:20), which is interpreted as teaching: <b>You shall not make images of My attendants,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies that were created to serve God, including the sun and the moon? |
| Exodus 20:20 | written: “You shall not make with Me gods of [ elohei ] silver and gods of gold” | Sanhedrin 7b:9 | It is <b>written: “You shall not make with Me gods of [<i>elohei</i>] silver and gods of gold”</b> (Exodus 20:20). The Gemara asks: It is <b>gods of silver and gods of gold that</b> you may <b>not make, but</b> are gods <b>of wood permitted?</b> Rather, <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> This verse discusses <b>a judge,</b> called <i>elohim</i>, <b>who comes,</b> i.e., is appointed, <b>due to</b> payment of <b>silver, and a judge who comes due to</b> payment of <b>gold.</b> |
| Exodus 20:20 | gods of silver or gods of gold” | Shevuot 29a:13 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> Moses explicitly indicated that the oath was according to God’s and his own understanding <b>because idolatry is also referred to</b> with the word: <b>God, as it is written:</b> “You shall not make with Me <b>gods of silver or gods of gold”</b> (Exodus 20:20). Therefore, the generally accepted meaning of the oath is ambiguous. |
| Exodus 20:20 | “In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you | Sotah 38a:11 | <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verbal analogy, as it can be derived from a verse. <b>It says</b> in the verse: <b>“In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you</b> and bless you” (Exodus 20:20). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that this verse literally means that the Divine Presence will be revealed <b>everywhere? Rather, this verse</b> must be interpreted by <b>transposition.</b> It must be reordered and read as follows: <b>In every place where I will come to you and bless you, there I will cause My name to be mentioned.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya explains that God is stating: <b>And where will I come to you and bless you? In the Temple.</b> Therefore, he derives: <b>There, in the Temple, I will cause My name to be mentioned,</b> but the ineffable name is not mentioned elsewhere. |
| Exodus 20:21 | the Divine Presence is with him? As it is stated: “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you” | Berakhot 6a:13 | The Gemara returns to Ravin bar Rav Adda’s statement: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that when even one who sits and engages in Torah</b> study, <b>the Divine Presence is with him? As it is stated: “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you”</b> (Exodus 20:21); God blesses even a single person who mentions God’s name, a reference to Torah study (<i>Iyyun Ya’akov</i>). |
| Exodus 20:21 | “An altar of earth you shall make for Me” | Chagigah 27a:3 | § The mishna taught: <b>All the vessels that were in the Temple had second</b> and third substitute vessels, <b>etc.</b> All the vessels that were in the Temple required immersion, apart from the golden altar and the bronze altar, because they are considered like the ground. The Gemara cites the relevant sources: <b>The bronze altar</b> is considered like the ground, <b>as it written</b> concerning this altar: <b>“An altar of earth you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21). <b>The golden altar</b> is considered like the ground, <b>as it is written: “The candelabrum and the altars”</b> (Numbers 3:31). The plural word “altars” indicates that <b>the</b> two <b>altars</b> of the Temple, the bronze one and the golden one, <b>are compared to each other,</b> teaching that just as the bronze altar is like the ground in that it cannot contract impurity, the same applies to the golden altar. |
| Exodus 20:21 | buried beneath the altar. It is stated here: “An altar of earth [ adama ] you shall make for Me” | Ketubot 111a:9 | <b>Rav Anan said: Anyone who is buried in Eretz Yisrael</b> is considered <b>as though</b> he is <b>buried beneath the altar. It is stated here: “An altar of earth [<i>adama</i>] you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21), <b>and it is stated there:</b> “For He does avenge the blood of His servants, and renders vengeance to His adversaries, <b>and atones for the land of [<i>admato</i>] His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:43). This teaches that one who is buried in the earth of Eretz Yisrael is considered as though he is buried beneath the altar in the Temple. |
| Exodus 20:21 | If you come to My house, I will come to your house; if you do not come to My house, I will not come to your house, as it is stated: “In every place that I cause My name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you” | Sukkah 53a:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>They said about Hillel the Elder that when he was rejoicing at the Celebration of the Place of the Drawing</b> of the Water <b>he said this: If I am here, everyone is here; and if I am not here, who is here?</b> In other words, one must consider himself as the one upon whom it is incumbent to fulfill obligations, and he must not rely on others to do so. <b>He would</b> also <b>say this: To the place that I love, there my feet take me,</b> and therefore, I come to the Temple. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: <b>If you come to My house, I will come to your house; if you do not come to My house, I will not come to your house, as it is stated: “In every place that I cause My name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you”</b> (Exodus 20:21). |
| Exodus 20:21 | “An altar of earth you shall make for Me” | Zevachim 58a:10 | <b>And if you would say</b> that the case is <b>where one dug tunnels in the ground</b> beneath the altar, <b>and slaughtered</b> the offerings <b>in them, in a case like this would</b> the <b>altar</b> itself <b>be</b> fit for use so that according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, one may slaughter the offerings of the most sacred order on the altar but not on the ground? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“An altar of earth you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21)? This verse indicates <b>that</b> the altar <b>must be attached to the earth,</b> so <b>that one may not build it on top of tunnels nor on top of arches.</b> |
| Exodus 20:21 | and you shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings” | Zevachim 58a:5 | Rav Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is an independent statement rather than an inference from the mishna. And with regard to the dispute in the mishna, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse:</b> “An altar of earth you shall make for Me, <b>and you shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings”</b> (Exodus 20:21). |
| Exodus 20:21 | and you shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings [ shelamekha ]” | Zevachim 59a:11 | It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse with regard to the altar: “An altar of earth you shall make for Me, <b>and you shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings [<i>shelamekha</i>]”</b> (Exodus 20:21). <b>Is it</b> true that <b>you slaughter</b> sacrificial animals <b>on</b> the altar itself? They are slaughtered on the ground near the altar. No, <b>rather,</b> the verse indicates that one is able to slaughter the sacrificial animals on account of the altar, i.e., <b>when</b> the altar <b>is complete [<i>shalem</i>], but not when it is lacking,</b> i.e., damaged. Rav Kahana <b>said: This is the verse that eluded Rav.</b> |
| Exodus 20:21 | “An altar of earth | Zevachim 61b:10 | <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that which <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi says in the name of Bar Kappara</b> with regard to the expansion of the altar: <b>They expanded</b> the altar to extend over the underground <b>cavities</b> into which the libations flowed. <b>Initially,</b> in the First Temple era, <b>they held</b> that when the verse states: <b>“An altar of earth</b> you shall make for Me” (Exodus 20:21), it means <b>that it</b> should be completely <b>filled with earth.</b> |
| Exodus 20:22 | and its height is one cubit. And he brings pieces of damp [ mefulamot ] stone, both large and small, | Zevachim 54a:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Levi teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one build the altar?</b> He <b>brings a square</b> wooden frame, <b>which is thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by thirty-two</b> cubits, <b>and its height is one cubit. And he brings pieces of damp [<i>mefulamot</i>] stone, both large and small,</b> which are the main components of the altar, which is described as: “An altar of stone” (Exodus 20:22). <b>And he brings plaster and molten lead and tar, and melts</b> them <b>and pours</b> the mixture into the gaps between the stones. <b>And this is the place of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar. |
| Exodus 20:22 | stones | Zevachim 61b:4 | § The Gemara raises another discussion concerning the altar: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: The altar in Shiloh was</b> fashioned <b>of stones,</b> unlike the portable altar constructed in the time of Moses, which was fashioned from copper. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: Why</b> must <b>the verses state</b> that the altar must be fashioned from <b>stones</b> (Exodus 20:22), and state again that the altar must be fashioned from <b>stones</b> (Deuteronomy 27:5), and mention yet again the word <b>stones</b> (Deuteronomy 27:6), with regard to the altar, for a total of <b>three times?</b> These allude to three different stone altars: <b>One in Shiloh, and one in Nov and Gibeon, and</b> one in the <b>Eternal House,</b> i.e., the Temple. |
| Exodus 20:23 | you shall not ascend by steps to My altar, | Nazir 45a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as the Torah states:</b> “And <b>you shall not ascend by steps to My altar,</b> so that you should not reveal your nakedness upon it” (Exodus 20:23). If the Torah is concerned about the disrespect to the altar presented by normal human behavior, then by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference the Torah prohibits acting <b>in a degrading manner</b> by shaving at the entrance to the Sanctuary. |
| Exodus 20:23 | you shall not ascend | Nazir 45a:11 | <b>A different version</b> of this derivation is stated <b>in the midrash to the</b> Torah <b>portion of <i>Naso</i>.</b> The Torah states: <b>“And the nazirite shall shave</b> his consecrated head at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering” (Numbers 6:18). <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: The verse is speaking of the peace-offering. Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> teaching that he shaves at the actual entrance to the Tent of Meeting? <b>If so, the Torah said:</b> “And <b>you shall not ascend</b> by steps to My altar” (Exodus 20:23). By <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference with regard <b>to</b> this <b>matter</b> it is derived <b>that he should not shave</b> at the <b>entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Rather, the verse is speaking of the peace-offering.</b> |
| Exodus 20:23 | As it is written: “Neither shall you go up by steps | Sanhedrin 7b:12 | <b>Bar Kappara taught,</b> based on a homiletical interpretation of a verse: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: <b>Be temperate in judgment</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:1)? <b>As it is written: “Neither shall you go up by steps</b> onto My altar” (Exodus 20:23), i.e., do not ascend hurriedly, <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“Now these are the ordinances</b> that you shall set before them” (Exodus 21:1). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a judge may not step over the heads of the sacred nation,</b> walking among those assembled for the lecture, who would sit upon the floor, in such a manner that he has the appearance of stepping on them? It is derived from that <b>which is stated: “Neither shall you go up by steps,” and juxtaposed to it</b> is an introduction to civil laws and courtroom regulations: <b>“Now these are the ordinances.”</b> This indicates that the prohibition against ascending upon steps applies to judges. |
| Exodus 21:1 | “And these are the civil laws that you shall set before them” | Bava Kamma15a:5 | <b>The school of Rabbi Elazar taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the civil laws given following the revelation at Sinai: <b>“And these are the civil laws that you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1). The reference to “them” in the verse is referring to all those who stood at the revelation, both men and women. <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all civil laws in the Torah.</b> |
| Exodus 21:1 | As it is stated: “Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them” | Eruvin 54b:15 | <b>And from where</b> do we derive <b>that</b> a teacher <b>must show</b> his students <b>the reasons</b> for the teachings? <b>As it is stated: “Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1), which indicates that the lesson must be set out in logical fashion for the students. |
| Exodus 21:1 | any place where you find gentile courts [ agoriot ], even if their laws are like Jewish laws, you may not attend them, as it is stated: “Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them” | Gittin 88b:10 | § <b>Abaye found Rav Yosef sitting</b> in court as the judge <b>and compelling</b> husbands to give their wives <b>bills of divorce. He said to him: But aren’t we ordinary people,</b> not ordained judges? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Tarfon would say:</b> With regard to <b>any place where you find gentile courts [<i>agoriot</i>], even if their laws are like Jewish laws, you may not attend them, as it is stated: “Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1). It is derived from here that one may go to court only <b>before them,</b> i.e., Jewish judges, <b>and not before gentiles. Alternatively,</b> it is derived that one may go to court <b>before them,</b> i.e., ordained judges, <b>and not before ordinary people.</b> Since we are not ordained judges, how can you perform a distinctly judicial act? |
| Exodus 21:1 | which you shall set before them” | Kiddushin 35a:9 | <b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer taught</b> as follows. <b>The verse states:</b> “Now these are the ordinances <b>which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1), stating “them” in the plural. This <b>verse equates a woman to a man</b> with regard <b>to all judgments in the Torah,</b> i.e., monetary cases and damages. <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states,</b> with regard to the ransom one pays if his animal killed a person: <b>“And killed a man or woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). Here too, <b>the verse equates a woman to a man,</b> with regard <b>to all deaths in the Torah,</b> i.e., the same <i>halakha</i> applies to an animal that kills either a man or a woman. |
| Exodus 21:1 | “Now these are the ordinances | Sanhedrin 7b:12 | <b>Bar Kappara taught,</b> based on a homiletical interpretation of a verse: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: <b>Be temperate in judgment</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:1)? <b>As it is written: “Neither shall you go up by steps</b> onto My altar” (Exodus 20:23), i.e., do not ascend hurriedly, <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“Now these are the ordinances</b> that you shall set before them” (Exodus 21:1). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a judge may not step over the heads of the sacred nation,</b> walking among those assembled for the lecture, who would sit upon the floor, in such a manner that he has the appearance of stepping on them? It is derived from that <b>which is stated: “Neither shall you go up by steps,” and juxtaposed to it</b> is an introduction to civil laws and courtroom regulations: <b>“Now these are the ordinances.”</b> This indicates that the prohibition against ascending upon steps applies to judges. |
| Exodus 21:2 | that it is written: “Six years he shall work; and in the seventh | Arakhin 18b:11 | The Gemara states: The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years, not calendar years, is derived from the fact <b>that it is written: “Six years he shall work; and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase: “And in the seventh,” teaches that <b>sometimes</b> it turns out <b>that he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed from when he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, although five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives, since he has not yet completed six years of service he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the day of the month in which he was sold. |
| Exodus 21:2 | with regard to a Hebrew slave | Arakhin 18b:7 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “sheep in their first year” (Numbers 28:3); and the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which time it is permitted to redeem a sold house in a walled city (Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one may not yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (Leviticus 25:15); <b>and</b> the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> (Exodus 21:2); <b>and similarly,</b> the years stated <b>with regard to a son and with regard to a daughter,</b> as explained below; <b>all of</b> these are calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the start of the period <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> of day at the end of the period, i.e., these periods are units of whole years; they do not expire on predetermined dates, such as at the end of the calendar year. |
| Exodus 21:2 | As it is written: “Six years he shall labor; and in the seventh | Kiddushin 16a:9 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew slave <b>can acquire himself after</b> six <b>years</b> of work. The Gemara cites the source for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is written: “Six years he shall labor; and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). |
| Exodus 21:2 | The verse states: “Six years he shall labor” | Kiddushin 16b:21 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t a Hebrew slave <b>who flees required to complete</b> the remaining years of his contract, at which point he should be entitled to receive a severance gift? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to a Hebrew slave <b>who flees</b> his master <b>that he is obligated to complete</b> his term? <b>The verse states: “Six years he shall labor”</b> (Exodus 21:2), and no less. Therefore, if a Hebrew slave runs away in the middle of this period, he is required to complete his six years of service. |
| Exodus 21:2 | the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out” | Kiddushin 17a:1 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> a slave who <b>became sick</b> and is unable to work must work additional time to compensate for the time missed. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out”</b> (Exodus 21:2), which indicates that he leaves his master in any case, even if he has not worked the full six years. |
| Exodus 21:2 | the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out” | Kiddushin 17a:3 | <b>The Master said</b> above: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> a slave who <b>became sick</b> and was unable to work must work additional time to compensate for the time missed. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out”</b> (Exodus 21:2). The Gemara asks: Is he excused from working additional time <b>even</b> if <b>he was sick for all six</b> years? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he was sick</b> for <b>three</b> years <b>and served</b> for <b>three</b> years, <b>he is not obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor, but if <b>he was sick</b> for <b>all six</b> years <b>he is obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is referring to a case where he is unable to perform strenuous labor but can execute minor tasks, such <b>as performing needlework</b> or sewing clothes. Since he can perform work of some kind, this slave is not required to work additional time to compensate for the time missed, even if he was ill for all six years. |
| Exodus 21:2 | When it says: “Six years he shall labor” | Kiddushin 17b:5 | <b>As the Sages taught,</b> with regard to a verse that deals with a Hebrew slave: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). This indicates that he serves <b>you and not an heir,</b> i.e., if the master dies his slave does not serve one who inherits his estate. Do <b>you say: You and not an heir, or</b> perhaps <b>is it even: You and not a son?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it says: “Six years he shall labor”</b> (Exodus 21:2), which does not indicate any exclusion, the inclusion of <b>a son is</b> thereby <b>stated. How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the other verse: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”?</b> The expression “serve you” emphasizes that he serves only <b>you but</b> he does <b>not</b> serve <b>an heir</b> other than a son. |
| Exodus 21:2 | the verse states: “Six years he shall work, and in the seventh | Niddah 48a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Six years he shall work, and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase <b>“and in the seventh”</b> indicates that <b>he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed since he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, it means that five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives; he has not yet completed six years of service, and he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the date on which he was sold. |
| Exodus 21:3 | “If he comes in begappo he shall leave begappo ” | Kiddushin 20a:6 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> concerning the following verse, which is referring to a Hebrew slave: <b>“If he comes in <i>begappo</i> he shall leave <i>begappo</i>”</b> (Exodus 21:3), which means that if <b>he enters with his body [<i>begufo</i>] he shall leave with his body [<i>begufo</i>]. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If <b>he enters alone he shall leave alone.</b> The Gemara clarifies. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the ruling that if <b>he enters with his body he shall leave with his body? Rava said:</b> This means <b>to say that he is not released through</b> the loss of his <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> (Exodus 21:26), meaning he does not leave his master because of damage done to his body. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from a different verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7). |
| Exodus 21:3 | “If he is married then his wife shall go out with him” | Kiddushin 22a:11 | <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse that deals with the emancipation of a slave: <b>“Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him”</b> (Leviticus 25:41). <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> This verse is puzzling, as, <b>if he is sold, are his sons and daughters sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his children,</b> and when the slave is emancipated his sons are released as well. <b>You say something similar</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If he is married then his wife shall go out with him”</b> (Exodus 21:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he is sold, is his wife sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his wife.</b> |
| Exodus 21:4 | “If his master give to him a wife” | Kiddushin 15a:10 | The Gemara continues to ask: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that if <b>one sells himself his master does not provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to one sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“If his master give to him a wife”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This serves to emphasize <b>“to him” but not to one who sells himself. And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, explains: <b>“To him”</b> means even <b>against his will.</b> |
| Exodus 21:4 | “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Kiddushin 68b:1 | <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave who marries a Canaanite maidservant: <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This indicates that the offspring of a Canaanite maidservant and a Hebrew slave are slaves, as she is. |
| Exodus 21:4 | maidservant too, | Kiddushin 68b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> one should learn from here with regard to a Canaanite <b>maidservant too,</b> that her child is like her, which means that the earlier proof from the verse: “The wife and her children” (Exodus 21:4), is not necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this source also teaches the <i>halakha</i> that the offspring of a maidservant is like her. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”?</b> This verse apparently teaches nothing new with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of lineage. The Gemara answers: It is required <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: |
| Exodus 21:4 | statement is upheld, because it is stated: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Kiddushin 69a:1 | With regard to <b>one who says to his</b> pregnant Canaanite <b>maidservant: You are hereby a free woman but your offspring</b> shall remain <b>a slave, the offspring is</b> emancipated <b>like her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. And the Rabbis say:</b> The master’s <b>statement is upheld, because it is stated: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). |
| Exodus 21:4 | “of his” comes and excludes him? Here too, although it is written: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Kiddushin 69a:10 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond to this claim? Is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>even though</b> the Torah <b>wrote: “By their families, by their fathers’ houses,”</b> nevertheless, the term <b>“of his” comes and excludes him? Here too, although it is written: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4), from which it is derived that the child of a Canaanite maidservant is like her, nevertheless the term <b>“of his” comes and excludes him. And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> Rabbi Tarfon, respond to this claim? They say: <b>Any offspring in the womb of a Canaanite maidservant is considered like the offspring in an animal’s womb.</b> Consequently, her children do not inherit the father’s status, even if his is the flawed lineage. |
| Exodus 21:4 | because it is stated: “The woman and her children shall be her master’s” | Temurah 25b:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the claim that <b>if one reserved</b> a consecration <b>it is reserved is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to his</b> pregnant Canaanite <b>maidservant: You are hereby a free woman but your offspring</b> shall remain <b>a slave, the offspring is</b> emancipated <b>like her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. And the Rabbis say: His statement is upheld.</b> This is <b>because it is stated: “The woman and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). |
| Exodus 21:4 | “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Yevamot 22b:5 | § The mishna says: <b>Except for whoever has a brother</b> born <b>from a</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant or from a gentile woman,</b> as in these cases he is not considered a brother. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Jewish slave who has children with a Canaanite maidservant: <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This means that the children also have the status of Canaanite slaves, which implies that the lineage of a Canaanite maidservant’s child comes from the mother and not from the father. |
| Exodus 21:4 | “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Yevamot 23a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who infer a different matter from the verse “your father’s wife’s nakedness,” <b>from where do they</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to exclude</b> one’s sister from a Canaanite <b>maidservant or gentile woman?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it</b> from that which was said with regard to a Canaanite maidservant who was married to a Hebrew slave: <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). From here they learn that the lineage of the maidservant’s children is connected only to their mother and not at all connected to their Jewish father. |
| Exodus 21:4 | “the wife and her children shall be | Yevamot 70a:5 | § It is stated in the mishna that <b>a slave disqualifies</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i> <b>due to</b> his engaging in <b>intercourse</b> with her, but not due to his being her offspring. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that he does not disqualify a woman whose offspring he is? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a maidservant married to a Hebrew slave, that when he is released, <b>“the wife and her children shall be</b> her master’s” (Exodus 21:4). This indicates that the maidservant’s children are considered her own and are not considered their father’s offspring at all. Therefore, a maidservant’s child does not disqualify his paternal grandmother from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Exodus 21:4 | as the verse states: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s” | Yevamot 78a:12 | <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from the following mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 69a): <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: <i>Mamzerim</i> can purify themselves</b> over the course of the generations. <b>How so?</b> If <b>a <i>mamzer</i> married</b> his non-Jewish <b>maidservant, the child</b> born to them is <b>a slave.</b> If the slave’s master, the <i>mamzer</i> who owns the maidservant, subsequently <b>freed</b> the child, <b>he becomes a free man</b> and is fit to enter into the congregation. <b>Apparently we assign</b> the child <b>to her,</b> the mother, and not to the father, as the child is deemed a slave rather than a <i>mamzer</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of the slave, <b>as the verse states: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). The words “her children” indicate that the children born to a non-Jewish maidservant are assigned to her. |
| Exodus 21:5 | “But if the slave shall say” | Kiddushin 15a:3 | <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, would answer: <b>That</b> formulation <b>is necessary</b> to teach that the mitzva of piercing applies to <b>“his ear” but not her ear.</b> He learns from the pronoun that piercing may be performed only on a male slave, not a maidservant. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“But if the slave shall say”</b> (Exodus 21:5). This indicates that piercing applies to <b>the slave but not</b> to <b>a maidservant.</b> |
| Exodus 21:5 | “But if the slave shall say” | Kiddushin 17b:11 | Do <b>you say</b> that this comparison obligates one <b>to grant a severance gift</b> to a Hebrew maidservant, <b>or is it</b> teaching <b>only</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>piercing</b> a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl, which is stated immediately beforehand, applies to a Hebrew maidservant as well? The Gemara explains: <b>When it says</b> with regard to piercing: <b>“But if the slave shall say”</b> (Exodus 21:5), which indicates that a Hebrew slave can issue this declaration <b>but a Hebrew maidservant cannot,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>piercing is</b> thereby <b>stated</b> and accounted for. |
| Exodus 21:5 | “I love my master, my wife, and my children” | Kiddushin 21b:16 | Rav Naḥman explains the proof: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>if his master cannot provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant,</b> it is not even relevant to suggest that a slave of priestly lineage could be pierced, as the fact that he cannot be pierced <b>could be derived</b> from another point, <b>as I require</b> the slave to say: <b>“I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5), <b>and</b> that declaration <b>cannot</b> be issued by a priest if his master may not provide him with a Canaanite maidservant. And <b>nothing more</b> can be answered to this proof. The reason given by the Rabbis proves that a Canaanite maidservant can be provided even to a priest. |
| Exodus 21:5 | shall say [ amor yomar ]: | Kiddushin 22a:3 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is stated with regard to a pierced slave: <b>“But if</b> the slave <b>shall say [<i>amor yomar</i>]:</b> I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free” (Exodus 21:5). The repeated verb teaches that he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> this statement <b>and repeats</b> it. If <b>he said at the beginning</b> of his <b>six</b> years of service that he wants to be pierced, <b>but he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free,”</b> i.e., he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> it <b>when he leaves.</b> |
| Exodus 21:5 | “I love my master, my wife, and my children” | Kiddushin 22a:5 | The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: If <b>he said</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years <b>and he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> learn this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically from</b> the phrase <b>“I will not go out free”? Let him derive</b> it from the fact <b>that we require</b> another condition. He has to be able to say: <b>“I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5) in order to become a pierced slave, <b>and</b> he <b>cannot</b> say this, as at the start of the six years he does not yet have children from the Canaanite maidservant his master provided for him. |
| Exodus 21:5 | his master has a wife and children and he does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I love my master, my wife, and my children” | Kiddushin 22a:7 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> If the slave <b>has a wife and children and his master does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you and your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The word “house” is referring to a wife and children, and therefore if the master does not have a wife and children the verse cannot be fulfilled, and the slave is not pierced. Similarly, if <b>his master has a wife and children and he does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5). |
| Exodus 21:6 | “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl” | Kiddushin 14b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that one who <b>sells himself is not pierced</b> with an awl? The Gemara answers: He derives this <b>from</b> the fact that <b>with regard to one sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which teaches: <b>His ear,</b> of this slave, <b>and not the ear of</b> a slave who <b>sells himself.</b> |
| Exodus 21:6 | forever” | Kiddushin 15a:21 | <b>And</b> likewise, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write</b> with regard to the release of a pierced slave in the Jubilee Year: <b>“And you shall return,</b> each man to his land” (Leviticus 25:10), <b>and it was necessary to write</b> as well: “And he shall serve him <b>forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which is interpreted by the Sages as referring to until the Jubilee Year. <b>As, if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only <b>“forever,” I would say</b> that this <b>actually</b> means <b>forever,</b> i.e., for his entire life. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And you shall return.”</b> |
| Exodus 21:6 | as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever” | Kiddushin 17b:13 | § The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>a pierced</b> Hebrew slave <b>and one sold to a gentile serve neither the son nor the daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a pierced</b> slave is <b>as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which indicates that he serves this master, <b>but not the son or the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to a Hebrew slave <b>sold to a gentile? Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the emancipating of a slave who was sold to a gentile: <b>“And he shall reckon with his purchaser”</b> (Leviticus 25:50), which teaches that this applies only to his purchaser <b>but not to the heirs of his purchaser.</b> |
| Exodus 21:6 | as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, | Kiddushin 21b:3 | § The Gemara returns to the mishna, which teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who is pierced</b> after serving six years <b>is acquired</b> as a slave for a longer period <b>through piercing his ear with an awl.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl,</b> and he shall serve him forever” (Exodus 21:6). |
| Exodus 21:6 | as it is written: “And he shall serve him | Kiddushin 21b:4 | The mishna further teaches that a pierced slave <b>acquires himself through</b> the advent of <b>the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and through the master’s death.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall serve him</b> forever” (Exodus 21:6). This term indicates that he serves only the master, <b>but not the son and not the daughter.</b> The term <b>“forever”</b> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>forever</b> represented <b>by the Jubilee</b> Year. The word “forever” does not mean for eternity, but refers to the end of the cycle of the Jubilee Year. |
| Exodus 21:6 | But isn’t it written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl” | Kiddushin 22b:1 | <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated: His ear to the door, I would say: He should pierce, opposite his ear, into the door</b> alone. In other words, with regard to <b>the door, yes,</b> it should be pierced, but <b>his ear</b> itself, <b>no,</b> it should not be pierced. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how could it even be suggested that <b>his ear</b> should <b>not</b> be pierced? <b>But isn’t it written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl”</b> (Exodus 21:6)? |
| Exodus 21:6 | doorpost” | Kiddushin 22b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> adds: Since the verse states <b>“door,” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to any door, regardless of <b>whether</b> it is <b>detached</b> from its doorpost or <b>whether it is not detached.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Then his master shall bring him to the court, and shall bring him to the door, or to the <b>doorpost”</b> (Exodus 21:6): <b>Just as a doorpost is upright</b> and attached, <b>so too, a door</b> must be <b>upright</b> and attached to the doorpost. |
| Exodus 21:6 | piercing | Menachot 10a:8 | Additionally, when the verse states: “Upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy leper, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“ear”</b> written here and <b>“ear”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl, as the verse states: “And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl” (Exodus 21:6). The verbal analogy teaches that the slave’s right ear is pierced. |
| Exodus 21:7 | sell his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” | Arakhin 30b:9 | One <b>does not come to</b> borrow with interest <b>until he</b> has already been compelled to <b>sell his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). The Gemara explains: <b>And even though his daughter is not</b> mentioned <b>in that context</b> in Leviticus, nevertheless, <b>a person prefers to sell his daughter and not to borrow</b> money <b>with interest.</b> This is <b>because there,</b> when one sells his daughter, the sum required in order to redeem her <b>continuously decreases, while here,</b> where one borrows with interest, his debt <b>continuously increases.</b> One may therefore assume that if one borrows with interest, he has already sold his daughter. |
| Exodus 21:7 | as it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” | Ketubot 40b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the handiwork of the daughter</b> goes <b>to her father?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7), juxtaposing his daughter to a maidservant: <b>Just as a maidservant, her handiwork</b> belongs <b>to her master,</b> as she was sold for that purpose; <b>so too a daughter, her handiwork</b> goes <b>to her father. Why do I</b> need this complicated proof? <b>Let him derive it</b> directly from the verse <b>“Being in her young womanhood, in her father’s house.” Rather,</b> this cannot be derived from that verse because <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to the nullification of vows.</b> A young woman is subject to her father’s authority with regard to her vows, which he has the right to nullify. The matter of monetary rights is not addressed in that verse. |
| Exodus 21:7 | as it is stated: “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant” | Ketubot 46b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter</b> belong <b>to her father?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7); <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father. Why do I</b> need this exposition? <b>Let him derive it from</b> the phrase <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house.” Rather, that</b> phrase, “being in her youth, in her father’s house,” <b>is written with regard to the nullification of vows,</b> but it is not referring to monetary matters. |
| Exodus 21:7 | to her father? As it is stated: “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant” | Ketubot 47a:2 | § The mishna further taught that a father is entitled <b>to</b> his daughter’s <b>earnings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter</b> belong <b>to her father? As it is stated: “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7), which indicates that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master,</b> as she was sold for this purpose, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> go <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only to <b>a minor, as</b> a father <b>can sell her</b> as a maidservant. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a young woman, whom he cannot sell,</b> perhaps <b>her earnings</b> should belong <b>to her.</b> |
| Exodus 21:7 | “She shall not go out as the men slaves do” | Kiddushin 16a:4 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7). One can infer: <b>But she can be acquired in</b> the manner of <b>the acquisition of</b> Canaanite <b>male slaves. And what is</b> this mode of acquisition? It is <b>a document.</b> |
| Exodus 21:7 | Isn’t it written: “She shall not go out as the men slaves do” | Kiddushin 16a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, one can equally <b>say</b> that <b>they,</b> Canaanite slaves, can be acquired <b>through a document, but others cannot</b> be acquired <b>through a document.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written: “She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7), and this is explained to mean that she, like other slaves, can be acquired through a document. The Gemara asks: Since these two verses can be explained in either manner, <b>what did you see</b> that led you to compare a Hebrew maidservant to a Canaanite slave with regard to a document, and what led you to differentiate her from a Canaanite slave with regard to acquisition through possession? Perhaps the opposite should be the case, i.e., she is similar to a Canaanite slave with regard to possession and differs from him concerning acquisition through a document? |
| Exodus 21:7 | “She shall not go out as the men slaves do” | Kiddushin 16a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Huna, what does he learn from this</b> verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse to teach <b>that she is not released on</b> account of an injury <b>to</b> the <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave.</b> If a master injures one of her limbs she is not emancipated, as explained in greater detail below. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Ḥisda,</b> from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it is teaching only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write: She shall not go out as the men slaves. What</b> is the reason for the additional term <b>“as the men slaves do”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> She is not freed due to injured limbs, and like a slave, she too can be acquired by means of a document. |
| Exodus 21:7 | as a maidservant” | Kiddushin 19b:14 | <b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states:</b> “And if a man sells his daughter <b>as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7), from which it is derived: There are <b>times when he sells her only as a maidservant,</b> not for the sake of marriage. This indicates that the designation of a maidservant is not a Torah obligation but is optional. Therefore, one can issue a stipulation that runs counter to the master designating her. |
| Exodus 21:7 | until he sells his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” | Kiddushin 20a:20 | The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand,</b> his poverty will increase <b>until he sells his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). The Gemara comments: <b>And even though “his daughter” is not written with regard to that matter</b> in Leviticus 25 but in Exodus, nevertheless, <b>it teaches us this</b> principle: <b>A person will sell his daughter rather than borrow with interest</b>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>His daughter can</b> occasionally <b>deduct</b> money from her debt <b>and</b> use it to <b>leave</b> her master, <b>but this</b> interest <b>continuously increases.</b> |
| Exodus 21:7 | “She shall not go out as the men slaves do” | Kiddushin 20a:6 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> concerning the following verse, which is referring to a Hebrew slave: <b>“If he comes in <i>begappo</i> he shall leave <i>begappo</i>”</b> (Exodus 21:3), which means that if <b>he enters with his body [<i>begufo</i>] he shall leave with his body [<i>begufo</i>]. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If <b>he enters alone he shall leave alone.</b> The Gemara clarifies. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the ruling that if <b>he enters with his body he shall leave with his body? Rava said:</b> This means <b>to say that he is not released through</b> the loss of his <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> (Exodus 21:26), meaning he does not leave his master because of damage done to his body. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from a different verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7). |
| Exodus 21:7 | father? As it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” | Kiddushin 3b:8 | The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter,</b> i.e., the profit from her labor, belongs <b>to</b> her <b>father? As it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). This comparison between a daughter and a Hebrew maidservant teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a Hebrew <b>maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara now asks: Why does Rav Huna need this derivation? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house,”</b> which indicates that any profit from her earnings as a young woman belongs to her father. |
| Exodus 21:7 | as it is written: “And if a man sells his daughter | Sotah 23b:9 | The mishna states: <b>A man can betroth his daughter</b> to another man while she is a minor, <b>but a woman cannot betroth her daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as it is written:</b> “And the father of the maiden shall say to the elders: <b>I gave my daughter to this man</b> as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:16), indicating that it is only the father who has the power to betroth his daughter. The mishna states: <b>A man can sell his daughter</b> as a maidservant <b>but a woman cannot sell her daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: This is derived <b>as it is written: “And if a man sells his daughter</b> to be a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7), indicating that only a man can sell his daughter, while a woman cannot. |
| Exodus 21:8 | who has not betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed” | Bekhorot 13a:5 | The mishna proceeds to enumerate other mitzvot in which one option takes precedence over another. <b>The mitzva of designating</b> a Hebrew maidservant to be betrothed to her master <b>takes precedence over the mitzva of redeeming</b> the maidservant from her master with money, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If she does not please her master, <b>who has not betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8). |
| Exodus 21:8 | seeing that he has dealt deceitfully with her [ bevigdo bah ]” | Bekhorot 34a:4 | The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>the vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> i.e., one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the pronunciation of the words, although it diverges from the spelling? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> discussing a Hebrew maidservant’s return to her father’s house. The verse states, with regard to her master: “He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, <b>seeing that he has dealt deceitfully with her [<i>bevigdo bah</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:8). The term “<i>bevigdo</i>” shares a root with a word for garment, <i>beged</i>. Therefore, the verse indicates that <b>once</b> the master <b>has spread his garment over her,</b> thereby designating her as his wife, if the maidservant is subsequently divorced or widowed, her father <b>may no longer sell her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative, and he interprets <i>bevigdo</i> as related to <i>bigdo</i>, his garment. |
| Exodus 21:8 | “Then he shall let her be redeemed” | Kiddushin 11b:9 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> a different explanation: <b>The reasoning of Beit Shammai,</b> that the minimum amount with which a woman can be betrothed is one dinar, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ḥizkiyya. As Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches that she can deduct</b> an amount <b>from</b> the price of <b>her redemption and leave</b> before her time of slavery is complete. If she comes into possession of money, she can pay the master for her value, less the work she has performed. Beit Shammai derive the <i>halakhot</i> of regular betrothal from the case of a Hebrew maidservant, as explained below. |
| Exodus 21:8 | be redeemed” | Kiddushin 14b:4 | But <b>from where do we</b> derive that a Hebrew slave can be <b>sold to a Jew</b> with money? The Gemara explains that with regard to a Hebrew maidservant, the <b>verse states:</b> “Then he shall let her <b>be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches</b> that if she acquires money and wishes to be emancipated before her time is complete, she <b>deducts</b> a sum <b>from her redemption.</b> The maidservant can deduct the value of time served from her purchase price and pay the remaining amount, and she then <b>is emancipated.</b> This teaches that a Hebrew maidservant is acquired through money, a <i>halakha</i> that applies to a male slave as well. |
| Exodus 21:8 | that the verse states: “Then he shall let her be redeemed” | Kiddushin 16a:11 | § The mishna teaches that a Hebrew slave can be freed <b>through the deduction of money. Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the reason is <b>that the verse states: “Then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches that</b> if she acquires money and wishes to be emancipated before her time is complete, she <b>deducts</b> the value of the years that she has not yet worked from the cost of <b>her redemption, and is emancipated.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies to a slave. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: And</b> a slave <b>can acquire himself with money, with</b> an item <b>worth money, and with a document.</b> |
| Exodus 21:8 | these tanna’im , as it is taught | Kiddushin 18a:16 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this issue is taught <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, seeing that he has dealt deceitfully with her [<i>bevigdo vah</i>]” (Exodus 21:8). |
| Exodus 21:8 | designate her, then he shall let her be redeemed” | Kiddushin 19a:10 | After mentioning the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, several times, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source in which the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> is stated? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Who did not <b>designate her, then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8). This juxtaposition indicates that designation applies only when she can be redeemed. Consequently, if she is at the end of her service <b>it is necessary that</b> when he designates her <b>there must be enough time</b> remaining <b>in the day for redemption.</b> There must be sufficient time for her to be redeemed, and if only a short amount of time remains, during which she would be unable to perform work worth one <i>peruta</i>, the master does not have the option of redeeming her. |
| Exodus 21:8 | “who did not designate her [ ye’adah ]” | Kiddushin 19a:8 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> an alternative explanation. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>With consent?</b> It means <b>with her consent. As Abaye, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught:</b> The verse <b>“who did not designate her [<i>ye’adah</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:8), <b>teaches that he is required to inform her [<i>ya’adah</i>].</b> |
| Exodus 21:8 | as it is already stated: “If she does not please her master, | Kiddushin 19b:17 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If</b> that verse serves <b>to teach that he can sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage, it is unnecessary, <b>as it is already stated: “If she does not please her master,</b> who designated her” (Exodus 21:8). This indicates <b>that she is displeasing in her marriage,</b> i.e., marriage to him was forbidden, and yet the sale is valid. If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “as a maidservant”?</b> This <b>teaches that he can sell her</b> |
| Exodus 21:8 | where Rabbi Eliezer derives | Kiddushin 20a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who derived from the term “as a maidservant” that one can stipulate that she cannot be designated, how does he know that one can sell her as a maidservant to people of unflawed lineage or relatives? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> that she can be sold to people of <b>flawed</b> lineage <b>from</b> the verse <b>where Rabbi Eliezer derives</b> it: “If she does not please her master” (Exodus 21:8). <b>With regard to relatives, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>he cannot sell her to relatives.</b> |
| Exodus 21:9 | his son” | Kiddushin 19a:3 | § <b>Reish Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the possibility <b>that a person can designate</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>for his minor son, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the sides of this dilemma. Does one learn from the verse: “And if he designates her for <b>his son”</b> (Exodus 21:9), that <b>the Merciful One states</b> that this applies to <b>any son,</b> even if he is too young to be married? <b>Or perhaps</b> it means <b>his son</b> who is <b>similar to him: Just as he is an adult man, so too, his son</b> must be <b>an adult man.</b> |
| Exodus 21:10 | as it is taught | Ketubot 47b:10 | § <b>Rava said: This <i>tanna</i>,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited below, <b>maintains</b> that the obligation of a husband to provide his wife’s <b>sustenance</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is taught</b> with regard to the verse pertaining to a husband’s obligations toward his wife: “If he takes another wife for himself, her food [<i>she’era</i>], her clothing [<i>kesuta</i>], and her conjugal rights [<i>onata</i>], he shall not diminish” (Exodus 21:10). <b>“<i>She’era</i>”; this is sustenance, and it likewise states: “Who also eat the flesh [<i>she’er</i>] of my people”</b> (Micah 3:3). <b>“<i>Kesuta</i>” is</b> understood <b>in its literal sense</b> as referring to clothing. <b>“<i>Onata</i>”; this is</b> her <b>conjugal rights, which is stated in the Torah, and so it says: “If you shall afflict [<i>te’aneh</i>] my daughters”</b> (Genesis 31:50), which indicates that a husband may not deprive his wife of her conjugal rights. |
| Exodus 21:10 | “If he takes himself another wife” | Kiddushin 16a:2 | § The mishna teaches: A Hebrew slave can be acquired by his master through money <b>or through a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that he can be acquired through a document? <b>Ulla said: The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he takes himself another wife”</b> (Exodus 21:10). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>to another</b> woman who is betrothed: <b>Just as another</b> woman <b>can be acquired</b> by her husband <b>through a document</b> (see 2a), <b>so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through a document.</b> |
| Exodus 21:10 | “If he take himself another | Kiddushin 9b:16 | The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a <i>yevama</i> is that she is bound and standing</b> waiting for the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., there is already a connection between them. Perhaps it is for this reason that intercourse enables a <i>yavam</i> to acquire a <i>yevama</i>, and the same cannot be said of a maidservant. Rather, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> a different claim: <b>Since it is written</b> with regard to a the master of a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he take himself another</b> wife” (Exodus 21:10), this <b>verse juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>with another</b> woman that a master marries: <b>Just as another</b> woman that a master marries <b>can be acquired through intercourse, so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through intercourse. Therefore,</b> the verse <b>teaches us,</b> with the phrase “and engages in sexual intercourse with her,” that this is not the case. |
| Exodus 21:10 | her, as it is written: “Her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he may not diminish” | Nedarim 15b:10 | § It is taught in the mishna that with regard to <b>one who says to his wife: Engaging in sexual intercourse with you is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> if he violates the vow <b>he is in</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane his word.</b> The Gemara asks: How can one render prohibited engaging in sexual intercourse with his wife? <b>But isn’t he duty bound by Torah law to</b> engage in sexual intercourse with <b>her, as it is written: “Her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he may not diminish”</b> (Exodus 21:10)? |
| Exodus 21:11 | the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” | Bekhorot 50b:7 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 2a) that <b>Beit Shammai say that</b> one can betroth her <b>with one dinar or with</b> an item that is <b>worth one dinar, and Beit Hillel say</b> one can betroth a woman <b>with one <i>peruta</i> or with</b> any item that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If so, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Asi,</b> who claims that all sums of money mentioned in the Torah are in Tyrian coinage, <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> even though the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel? |
| Exodus 21:11 | Rather, | Ketubot 46b:10 | <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara returns to the previous exposition of the verse: “Then she shall go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11). As for the question of why she does not receive the money herself, the Gemara explains that <b>it is reasonable</b> to assume <b>that when the Merciful One excludes</b> a case by means of this verse, <b>He excludes</b> a case where a girl <b>leaves</b> someone’s authority <b>in the corresponding</b> situation to the case of the Hebrew maidservant. |
| Exodus 21:11 | “Then she shall go out for nothing, without money” | Ketubot 46b:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna indicates that a father receives the money of his daughter’s betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the father is entitled to the <b>money</b> of her betrothal? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to an emancipated Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then she shall go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11), from which it is inferred: <b>There is no money for this master,</b> i.e., her master does not receive money when she leaves him, <b>but there is money for a different master, and who is</b> this? <b>Her father,</b> who also had authority over her, like her master. When she leaves her father’s jurisdiction via betrothal, he is entitled to the betrothal money. |
| Exodus 21:11 | Rather, | Kiddushin 3b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a young woman’s betrothal money belongs to her father is derived from the verse: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), as previously stated. As for the question why the money does not belong to her, the Gemara answers that <b>it is reasonable that when</b> the verse <b>excludes</b> another situation and indicates that there is no money for this master but there is money for a different master, |
| Exodus 21:11 | “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” | Kiddushin 3b:5 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant acquiring freedom from her master: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). The extraneous phrase: Without money, indicates that <b>there is no money for this master,</b> i.e., in this case the master she leaves loses the money he paid for her, <b>but there is money for a different master,</b> i.e., another master receives money for her when she leaves his authority. <b>And who is</b> the other master who can transfer her to someone else and receives money for her? This is her <b>father.</b> |
| Exodus 21:11 | “Then shall she go out for nothing” | Kiddushin 4a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”</b> (Exodus 21:11), <b>come for that</b> purpose, to teach that there is no money for this master, but there is money for a different master? <b>But it is required for that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” should be understood as follows: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of adulthood,</b> i.e., a Hebrew maidservant leaves her owner’s authority once she becomes an adult. <b>“Without money [<i>ein kasef</i>]”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of</b> her <b>youth,</b> i.e., when she becomes a young woman she leaves his authority. |
| Exodus 21:11 | “Then shall she go out for nothing, | Kiddushin 4b:1 | Therefore the superfluous phrase: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,</b> without money” (Exodus 21:11), <b>teaches us</b> that even an <i>ailonit</i> can be sold as a Hebrew maidservant and is released upon reaching adulthood. |
| Exodus 21:12 | that it is written: “One who strikes a man and he dies shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 84b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> prove that one is executed by strangulation for striking his father or mother even if he does not kill them <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “One who strikes a man and he dies shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:12), <b>and it is written: “Or if in enmity he struck him with his hand and he died</b> he shall be put to death” (Numbers 35:21). <b>Learn from</b> these verses in which it states: Strikes and he dies, that <b>anywhere that there is</b> mention of <b>striking without specifying</b> a resultant death, <b>it is not</b> referring to a case where the blow caused one’s <b>death.</b> |
| Exodus 21:13 | “If a man lie not in wait” | Bava Kamma26b:7 | In a case where <b>he intended to throw</b> the stone, and he intended to throw it for a distance of only <b>two</b> cubits <b>but</b> instead he <b>threw</b> it a distance of <b>four</b> cubits, as it went farther than he wanted it to go, <b>with regard to damages</b> he is <b>liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to Shabbat</b> he is exempt, as <b>we require planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> as a condition for liability. <b>With regard to exile</b> he is liable, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“If a man lie not in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13), which serves <b>to exclude</b> from the death penalty a situation where one <b>intended to throw</b> the stone for <b>two</b> cubits <b>but</b> he actually <b>threw</b> it for <b>four</b> cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <b>With regard to a slave, the</b> same <b>dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> applies. |
| Exodus 21:13 | “If a man lie not in wait” | Bava Kamma26b:8 | And if <b>he intended to throw</b> the stone <b>four</b> cubits <b>but</b> instead he <b>threw</b> it <b>eight</b> cubits, <b>with regard to damages</b> he is <b>liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to Shabbat, if he said</b> to himself when he threw the stone that he would be satisfied <b>wherever it may land,</b> then <b>yes,</b> he is liable, as he intended to throw it a distance of four cubits, which is the minimum necessary to violate the prohibited labor of carrying in the public domain. <b>If</b> he did <b>not</b> throw the stone aimlessly but rather had selected a target that was four cubits away, then he is <b>not</b> liable as he did not perform the precise planned, constructive labor that he had intended. <b>With regard to exile,</b> the Torah states: <b>“If a man lie not in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13), which serves <b>to exclude</b> from the death penalty a situation where one <b>intended to throw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits <b>but</b> he actually <b>threw</b> it <b>eight</b> cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <b>With regard to a slave, the</b> same <b>dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> applies. |
| Exodus 21:13 | place | Eruvin 51a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is the measure of one’s place? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: We derive</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>place</b> written here: “Let no man go out of his place,” and <b>from</b> the term <b>place</b> written with regard to an unwitting murderer: “Then I will appoint you a place to where he shall flee” (Exodus 21:13). This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, <b>and</b> the term <b>place</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing. And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing,</b> written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). <b>And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> which appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside. And</b> the term <b>outside</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside, as it is written</b> with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: <b>“And you shall measure from outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the city on the east side two thousand cubits,</b> and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5). From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities. |
| Exodus 21:13 | “And one who did not lie in wait, but God caused it to come to his hand, | Makkot 10b:3 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish introduced this portion with an introduction from here:</b> It is stated with regard to an unintentional murderer: <b>“And one who did not lie in wait, but God caused it to come to his hand,</b> and I will appoint you a place where he may flee” (Exodus 21:13). Now this is puzzling. Why would God cause one to sin in this manner? The verse states: <b>“As the ancient parable says: From the wicked comes forth wickedness”</b> (I Samuel 24:13). Evil incidents befall those who have already sinned. |
| Exodus 21:13 | and I will appoint for you a place | Makkot 12b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Apropos the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that a Levite is exiled from one city to another city, the Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And one who did not lie in wait…<b>and I will appoint for you a place</b> where he may flee” (Exodus 21:13). <b>“And I will appoint for you”;</b> God said to Moses: There will be a place that provides refuge for unintentional murderers already <b>during your lifetime. “A place”;</b> it will be <b>from your place,</b> meaning the Levite camp served as the place that provided refuge in the wilderness. <b>“Where he may flee”;</b> this <b>teaches that Israel would exile</b> unintentional murderers <b>in the wilderness</b> as well, before they entered the land. <b>To where</b> did <b>they exile</b> unintentional murderers when they were in the wilderness? They exiled them <b>to the Levite camp,</b> which provided refuge. |
| Exodus 21:13 | “And who did not lie in wait” | Makkot 7b:7 | And it is written with regard to an unintentional murderer: <b>“And who did not lie in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13); this serves to <b>exclude</b> one who <b>had intent to throw</b> a stone <b>two</b> cubits <b>and he</b> inadvertently <b>threw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits and killed a person. And it is written concerning an unintentional murderer: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is derived: <b>Just as a forest</b> is ownerless property, and there is <b>permission for the victim and for the assailant to enter there, so too,</b> unintentional murder that occurs in <b>any</b> place where there is <b>permission for the victim and for the assailant to enter there,</b> is punishable with exile. The unintentional murder of one who entered the assailant’s property without his permission is not cause for the murderer to be exiled. |
| Exodus 21:13 | and I will appoint for you a place | Zevachim 117a:5 | The Gemara replies: <b>Yes, and so it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse concerning the cities of refuge. The verse states: “And one who did not lie in wait…<b>and I will appoint for you a place</b> where he may flee” (Exodus 21:13). The phrase “I will appoint for you” teaches that God said to Moses: There will be a place that provides refuge for unintentional murderers even <b>during your lifetime.</b> The term <b>“a place”</b> means that it will be from <b>your place,</b> meaning the Levite camp served as the place that provided refuge in the wilderness. <b>“Where he may flee” teaches that</b> the Jews <b>would exile</b> unintentional murderers <b>in the wilderness</b> as well, before they entered the land. <b>To where did they exile</b> unintentional murderers when they were in the wilderness? They exiled them <b>to the Levite camp,</b> which provided refuge. |
| Exodus 21:14 | “You shall take him from My altar, that he may die” | Sanhedrin 35b:12 | The Gemara questions this inference: <b>But</b> if so, how would one explain <b>that which is written</b> in the verse concerning one liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment: <b>“You shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14)? This verse indicates that the court administering capital punishment does override the performance of the Temple service. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning an offering of an individual, which does not override Shabbat.</b> The verse is teaching that the court takes the priest to execute him even if this will result in the offering of an individual not being sacrificed. |
| Exodus 21:14 | you shall take him from My altar, that he may die” | Sanhedrin 35b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Murder itself should override Shabbat based on</b> this <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the Temple <b>service, which overrides Shabbat,</b> nevertheless <b>murder overrides it,</b> and the source for this is <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; <b>you shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14); then with regard to <b>Shabbat, which is overridden due to</b> the Temple <b>service, is it not logical that murder should override it?</b> |
| Exodus 21:14 | “But if a man come intentionally upon his neighbor to slay him with guile” | Sanhedrin 41a:2 | <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> a source for the requirement of forewarning from the verse concerning the court-imposed capital punishment meted out to a murderer, as it is states: <b>“But if a man come intentionally upon his neighbor to slay him with guile”</b> (Exodus 21:14). How do the witnesses know that he acted intentionally? It must be <b>that they forewarned him, and still he</b> acts <b>intentionally.</b> |
| Exodus 21:14 | “But if a man comes intentionally [ yazid ] | Sanhedrin 69a:4 | A Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“But if a man comes intentionally [<i>yazid</i>]</b> against his neighbor, to slay him with guile, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die” (Exodus 21:14). The use of the term <i>yazid</i> in this context and its juxtaposition to the word “man” teaches that <b>a man can heat [<i>mezid</i>]</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm, but a minor cannot heat</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm.</b> Therefore, even though a minor can engage in full intercourse with a woman, he cannot father a child. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mezid</i> is a term</b> meaning <b>heating</b> up? <b>As it is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“And Jacob cooked [<i>vayyazed</i>] pottage”</b> (Genesis 25:29). |
| Exodus 21:14 | “You shall take him from My altar, that he may die” | Yevamot 7a:1 | <b>If</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> which includes the sacrifice of offerings, <b>is</b> so <b>severe that it overrides Shabbat,</b> as offerings were brought on Shabbat, and yet the <i>halakha</i> of <b>murder overrides it,</b> i.e., the obligation to execute a sentenced convict overrides the Temple service, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to one sentenced to death: <b>“You shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14), then in the case of <b>Shabbat, which is overridden by</b> the Temple <b>service, is it not right that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>murder should</b> likewise override it? |
| Exodus 21:14 | you shall take him from My altar, that he may die” | Yoma 85a:15 | <b>Rabbi Akiva answered and said</b> that it is stated: <b>“And if a man comes purposefully upon his neighbor</b> to slay him with guile, <b>you shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14). The phrase “take him <b>from My altar”</b> implies that if the murderer is a priest and comes to perform the service, one does not wait for him to do so but takes him to his execution immediately. <b>But</b> one should <b>not</b> take him <b>from on top of My altar.</b> If he already began the service and is in the midst of it, one does not take him down from the altar immediately but instead allows him to finish his service. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught only</b> that a priest is not removed from the altar <b>in order to execute</b> him for murder, |
| Exodus 21:15 | liable | Chullin 82b:15 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one is uncertain which of two men is his father, and he <b>struck this</b> man <b>and then struck that</b> man, or <b>cursed this</b> man <b>and then cursed that</b> man, <b>or struck both of them simultaneously,</b> or <b>cursed both of them simultaneously,</b> in all these cases he is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition of: “And he that strikes his father, or his mother, shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:15), or that of: “And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:17), as one of them is certainly his father. |
| Exodus 21:15 | a difficulty according to | Sanhedrin 53a:11 | <b>And</b> if it is <b>rather</b> the case of <b>one who wounds his father or his mother</b> that poses <b>a difficulty according to</b> Rabbi Zeira, as it is stated: “And he who smites his father or his mother shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:15), and therefore perhaps <b>we should derive and learn from</b> the punishment of <b>a necromancer and a sorcerer</b> that one who wounds his father or his mother should be executed by stoning, this too does not pose a difficulty. |
| Exodus 21:15 | as it is written: “One who strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 84b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One who strikes his father or his mother</b> is executed by strangulation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “One who strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:15), <b>and every death stated in the Torah without specification</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than strangulation.</b> |
| Exodus 21:15 | as we liken striking to cursing | Sanhedrin 85a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> explanation <b>works out well</b> with regard to <b>cursing,</b> as that is the prohibition mentioned in that verse. <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <i>halakha</i> is the same with regard to <b>striking?</b> The Gemara answers: We derive that the <i>halakha</i> is the same for both, <b>as we liken striking to cursing</b> based on the juxtaposition between the verses that address the cases of one who strikes his father (Exodus 21:15) and one who curses his father (Exodus 21:17). |
| Exodus 21:16 | proves | Bava Kamma68b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: The case of <b>stealing a human being,</b> i.e., kidnapping, <b>proves</b> that your reasoning is incorrect. The Torah states: “And he who steals a man and sells him or if he is found in his hand, he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16). In this case <b>there is no owner’s despair,</b> as no one ever despairs of his own freedom. Consequently, the thief’s sale of the person he kidnapped is invalid, <b>and</b> yet the Torah states that he is <b>liable</b> to receive the death penalty for selling him. One can learn <b>by inference</b> from this question <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that if the thief sells the stolen animal <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. |
| Exodus 21:16 | states: And one who abducts a man, | Sanhedrin 85b:22 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“If a man shall be found abducting a person of his brethren</b> from the children of Israel, and he exploited him and sold him, then that abductor shall die” (Deuteronomy 24:7). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man who abducted</b> another is liable. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman</b> who abducts another is liable as well? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: And one who abducts a man,</b> and sells him, if he be found in his hand, he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16), where the sex of the abductor is not specified. |
| Exodus 21:16 | “Or if he is found in his possession, | Sanhedrin 86a:7 | Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: The Rabbis’ opinion is derived from the phrase: <b>“Or if he is found in his possession,</b> he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16), from which <b>I am saying</b> my inference, that it is derived: If he is found, to the exclusion of one who was already found. |
| Exodus 21:17 | it is stated: “He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death” | Kiddushin 30b:20 | Likewise, <b>it is stated: “He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:17), <b>and it is stated: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>The verse equates the blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>of</b> one’s <b>father and mother to the blessing of the Omnipresent. But with regard to striking,</b> i.e., with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who strikes his father or mother is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>it is certainly not possible</b> to say the same concerning the Holy One, Blessed be He. |
| Exodus 21:17 | “And one who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 85b:10 | Since according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoshiya, the phrase is not redundant, <b>from where does he</b> derive that one is liable for cursing his father after his death? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that which is written: <b>“And one who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:17). |
| Exodus 21:18 | and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist” | Bava Kamma90b:14 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 12:3) with regard to what is stated in the Torah concerning injuries: “And if men contend, <b>and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist”</b> (Exodus 21:18), that <b>Shimon HaTimni says: Just as a fist is unique</b> in <b>that it is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that it was the fist used to strike, as a fist remains attached to the assailant, <b>so too,</b> a ruling can be issued in the case of <b>any</b> item <b>that is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that this was the item used to strike? This serves to <b>exclude</b> a case <b>where</b> the stone that injured <b>left the possession of the witnesses</b> and is not available to be inspected by the court to assess if it is capable of causing the purported injury. |
| Exodus 21:18 | that two assessments are written. | Sanhedrin 78b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Neḥemya, that is</b> the reason <b>that two assessments are written.</b> It is written in one verse: “And if men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he did not die but is bedridden” (Exodus 21:18), indicating that after the initial blow the victim is assessed to determine whether or not he is expected to die. In the following verse it is written: “If he rises and walks outside upon his staff, then he that struck him is absolved” (Exodus 21:19), indicating that there is an additional assessment to determine whether or not he fully recovers. <b>One verse</b> is where <b>they assessed</b> his condition, saying that it would lead <b>to death, and he recovered</b> fully; <b>and one verse</b> is where <b>they assessed</b> his condition, saying that it would lead <b>to death, and</b> his condition <b>eased from what it was</b> and he died thereafter. <b>But according to the Rabbis, why do I</b> need <b>two assessments?</b> |
| Exodus 21:19 | and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” | Bava Kamma84a:13 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava</b> that concerning one who was injured by another, who must pay for damage, the <b>verse states:</b> “If he rises again, and walks outside upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be absolved; only he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, <b>and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), which teaches that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>medical costs</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), is referring to an <b>actual</b> eye, then <b>just as</b> it is so <b>that</b> the injured party <b>needs healing,</b> the one who caused him the injury <b>also needs healing</b> after the court removes his eye; why, then, does the Torah require that he pay compensation for medical costs as well? |
| Exodus 21:19 | difference | Bava Kamma84a:14 | The Gemara objects: <b>What</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps there is</b> one <b>whose flesh heals quickly, and there is</b> another <b>whose flesh does not heal quickly.</b> Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for medical costs. <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> when the Torah states: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <b>to give</b> the injured party compensation for <b>the difference between</b> their respective medical costs. |
| Exodus 21:19 | which the verse repeated | Bava Kamma85a:11 | Rabba explains: <b>The Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>hold</b> that <b>a wound may be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage.</b> Consequently, if the bandage causes side effects which lead the injured party to incur additional medical expenses, those expenses are considered to have resulted from the original injury. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>a wound may not be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>medical costs,</b> about <b>which the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay them, by stating: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <b>is liable</b> to pay compensation. But for <b>loss of livelihood,</b> about <b>which the verse did not repeat</b> the obligation to pay it, the one who caused the injury <b>is not liable</b> to pay compensation. |
| Exodus 21:19 | which the verse repeated | Bava Kamma85a:13 | He explains the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>since</b> a wound <b>may not be</b> wrapped <b>in an excessive bandage,</b> then with regard to <b>medical costs,</b> about <b>which the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay them, by stating: “<i>Verappo yerappe</i>” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <b>is liable</b> to pay compensation. But for <b>loss of livelihood,</b> about <b>which the verse did not repeat</b> the obligation to pay, the one who caused the injury <b>is not liable</b> to pay compensation. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>hold: Since the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, one is also liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood, which is juxtaposed to</b> the obligation to pay for <b>medical costs,</b> as the verse states: “Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.” |
| Exodus 21:19 | “Only | Bava Kamma85a:14 | The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that even though medical costs and loss of livelihood are juxtaposed, the one who caused the injury is <b>not liable</b> to pay compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> in this case, <b>because the Merciful One restricted it</b> in the Torah, as the verse states: <b>“Only</b> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19). “Only” is a restricting term. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one must pay for loss of livelihood in this case as well, hold that the word <b>“only” is coming</b> to exclude growths <b>that were not due to the injury,</b> with regard to which the one who caused the injury is exempt from liability. |
| Exodus 21:19 | “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [ verappo yerappe ]” | Bava Kamma85a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>who say: Anyone who is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, and anyone who is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, why do I</b> need, i.e., how do I account for, the fact <b>that the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay <b>medical costs?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:19), it is derived <b>from here that permission is granted to a doctor to heal,</b> and it is not considered to be an intervention counter to the will of God. |
| Exodus 21:19 | The verse states: “And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” | Bava Kamma85a:16 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if growths appeared due to the injury, and the wound reopened,</b> then the one who caused the injury is again <b>liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and is liable to give him</b> the value <b>of his loss of livelihood</b> while he recovers from the reopened wound? <b>The verse states: “And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19). One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the growths <b>were not due to the injury.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only</b> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood,” in order to exclude this case. This is in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the previous <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Even</b> if the growths appeared <b>due to the injury,</b> the one who caused the injury is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “Only.”</b> |
| Exodus 21:19 | verse states: “He shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [ verappo yerappe ]” | Bava Kamma85b:2 | With regard to compensation for medical costs in a case where one pays compensation for damage, <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava</b> that the <b>verse states: “He shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:19), and the doubled term teaches that the one who caused the injury is liable <b>to give</b> monetary compensation for <b>medical costs in a case of</b> compensation for <b>damage.</b> |
| Exodus 21:19 | “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” | Berakhot 60a:29 | <b>Abaye</b> responded and <b>said: One should not say this, as</b> it was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that from the verse, <b>“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), <b>from here</b> we derive <b>that permission is granted to a doctor to heal.</b> The practice of medicine is in accordance with the will of God. |
| Exodus 21:19 | “If he rises and walks outside with his staff, he who struck him is absolved” | Ketubot 33b:3 | <b>Rather, Rav Ya’akov from Nehar Pekod said in the name of Rava</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that one pays and is not flogged is derived <b>from here.</b> With regard to one who struck another with a stone or his fist and did not kill him but caused him to be bedridden, it is written: <b>“If he rises and walks outside with his staff, he who struck him is absolved”</b> (Exodus 21:19). <b>And could it enter your mind that this</b> victim <b>is walking in the marketplace and that</b> aggressor <b>is executed</b> as a murderer? <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>teaches that one imprisons</b> the aggressor while the injured party recuperates, <b>and if he dies</b> due to the blow he received, <b>we kill him. And if he does not die</b> and recovers, the aggressor’s punishment is based on the verse <b>“His loss of livelihood he shall give, and he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19). |
| Exodus 21:19 | upon his staff, then he that struck him is absolved; | Sanhedrin 78b:1 | <b>upon his staff, then he that struck him is absolved;</b> only for his loss of livelihood shall he give and he shall heal him” (Exodus 21:19). The phrase: “Then he that struck him is absolved,” is superfluous; <b>would it enter your mind</b> to say <b>that this</b> individual whom he struck <b>is walking in the marketplace, and that</b> individual who struck him <b>will be executed</b> as a murderer? <b>Rather, this</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the doctors <b>assessed</b> his condition, saying that it would lead <b>to death, and</b> his condition <b>eased</b> somewhat <b>from what it was</b> and he walked in the marketplace, <b>and thereafter</b> his condition <b>worsened and he died,</b> and the verse is teaching <b>that he is exempt.</b> |
| Exodus 21:20 | he shall be avenged” | Sanhedrin 52b:13 | The Gemara answers that it is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the verse: “And if a man smites his slave or his maidservant by the staff and he dies under his hand, <b>he shall be avenged”</b> (Exodus 21:20). Prima facie, <b>I do not know what this vengeance is</b> referring to. <b>When it says: “And I will bring upon you the sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant”</b> (Leviticus 26:25), <b>you must say</b> that <b>vengeance is</b> decapitation by the <b>sword.</b> |
| Exodus 21:21 | is “his money” | Bava Batra50a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>the second</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is “his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), i.e., his property; but <b>the first</b> master is <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not “his money.”</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>not like ownership of the item itself.</b> Therefore, the first master, who currently enjoys the use of the slave, does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Exodus 21:21 | “a day or two days” | Bava Batra50a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> states four opinions: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that during those thirty days, only <b>the first</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days”</b> (Exodus 21:21). Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first master is included in this exemption, <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, as he enjoys the use of the slave, <b>but the second</b> master <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not under his</b> authority. |
| Exodus 21:21 | he shall not be punished; for he is his money” | Bava Batra50b:3 | The Gemara explains how Ameimar’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. <b>And Rava says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar?</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two days, <b>he shall not be punished; for he is his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), and he understands this to be referring to a slave that is <b>“his money,”</b> a slave <b>that is unique to him,</b> so this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave. Rabbi Elazar holds that one is considered to own an item only if he owns the item itself and also enjoys the use of it. This is the source of Ameimar’s statement that neither the husband nor the wife can sell usufruct property: The husband cannot sell it because he does not own it, and the wife cannot sell it because only the husband has the right to enjoy the profits. |
| Exodus 21:21 | for he is his money” | Bava Kamma90a:9 | The Gemara notes that <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; <b>for he is his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), and Rabbi Eliezer understands this to be referring to a slave that is <b>his money</b> alone, a slave <b>that is unique to him,</b> and therefore this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave. |
| Exodus 21:22 | as the woman’s husband shall place upon him” | Arakhin 7a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the court executes the pregnant woman rather than waiting? After all, <b>it is</b> part of <b>her body.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written:</b> “And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her offspring depart…he shall be fined, <b>as the woman’s husband shall place upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:22), the fetus <b>is</b> considered to be the <b>property of the husband.</b> If so, the court should wait until she gives birth before executing her, <b>and not</b> cause <b>him to lose</b> the fetus. Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not take this factor into account. |
| Exodus 21:22 | earlier | Bava Kamma40a:10 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Imposing is stated</b> in the <b>later</b> verse: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposing is stated</b> in the <b>earlier</b> verse, concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him” (Exodus 21:22). This verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage, the evaluation is <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party<b>,</b> i.e., the fetus, <b>so too here,</b> the ransom is <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party. |
| Exodus 21:22 | Rather, Abaye and Rava both say | Bava Kamma42a:11 | Rava then retracted this explanation of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion. <b>Rather, Abaye and Rava both say</b> that Rabbi Akiva’s inference is correct, according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, but with regard to the continuation of the verse: “But if any harm follows, you shall give life for life” (Exodus 21:22). With regard to <b>men,</b> if <b>there is no harm</b> caused <b>to the woman,</b> i.e., she is not killed, <b>they shall be punished</b> financially and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But if <b>there is harm</b> caused <b>to the woman</b> and she dies, <b>they shall not be punished</b> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This distinction applies only with regard to men <b>but not</b> with regard to <b>oxen, as even if there is harm</b> caused to the woman, the owners <b>shall be punished</b> financially. In order to preclude this inference, <b>the Merciful One then wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring. |
| Exodus 21:22 | woman | Bava Kamma42a:4 | <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> It is unnecessary for the verse to teach this. <b>Doesn’t it say</b> with regard to paying compensation for miscarried offspring: <b>“If men struggle and hurt a</b> pregnant <b>woman</b> and her offspring emerge, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22); from which it is inferred that <b>men</b> who cause a woman to miscarry are liable to pay compensation for the offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen</b> who cause a woman to miscarry is <b>not</b> liable? |
| Exodus 21:22 | What is the reason? The verse states: “As the husband [ ba’al ] of the woman shall impose upon him” | Bava Kamma43a:4 | <b>Rav Pappa said: The Torah awarded the</b> payment of <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband, even if he</b> is not actually her legal husband but rather <b>engaged in licentious sexual intercourse with her.</b> Although he has no rights to her property, the damages for the miscarried offspring belong to him alone, as he is the father of the offspring. <b>What is the reason? The verse states: “As the husband [<i>ba’al</i>] of the woman shall impose upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:22), indicating that damages are not collected by the woman, but by the man who engaged in intercourse [<i>ba’al</i>] with her, impregnating her. Therefore, if they got divorced, the ex-husband receives the payment. |
| Exodus 21:22 | as we learned | Bava Kamma49a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>who say: The increase</b> in her value due to <b>the offspring</b> is <b>also</b> given <b>to the husband?</b> The Gemara answers: They derive it from a redundancy in a verse, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And her offspring emerge,” don’t I know</b> by inference <b>that she was pregnant?</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A pregnant</b> woman,” and not just “a woman”? <b>To inform you</b> that even the <b>increase</b> in her value due to <b>the pregnancy</b> is given <b>to the husband.</b> |
| Exodus 21:22 | the verse: | Bava Kamma49a:4 | The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> could have <b>said to you: The same is true, that even</b> if the oxen <b>intended to</b> gore <b>the woman,</b> the owners are <b>also exempt from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b> As for <b>that which is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>An ox that was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox, it <b>is</b> taught this way <b>since it wants to teach the latter clause: A person that was intending to</b> injure <b>another</b> person, <b>as this</b> case is <b>written</b> explicitly in <b>the verse:</b> “And if men struggle and hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). In the case in the verse, the assailant intended to injure another person but injured the woman instead. Therefore, the mishna <b>also teaches the first clause</b> in that style: <b>An ox that was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox. |
| Exodus 21:22 | and giving is stated above, | Chagigah 11a:8 | The Gemara elaborates. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> “But if any harm follow, then you shall give <b>life for life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). This verse is referring to a payment of <b>money.</b> Do <b>you say money, or</b> perhaps <b>it is solely an actual life</b> that is demanded? The term <b>giving is stated below:</b> “You shall give life for life,” <b>and giving is stated above,</b> in the previous verse: “And he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> the giving is in the form of <b>money, so too here,</b> it is referring to a payment of <b>money.</b> Although this <i>halakha</i> is not explicit in the Torah, the verses lend support to it. |
| Exodus 21:22 | from here: “If men quarrel and hurt a pregnant woman so that her child departs from her, | Ketubot 33a:8 | § <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The fact that in the case of <b>one who injures another as well he pays money and is not flogged</b> is derived not by means of a verbal analogy but <b>from here: “If men quarrel and hurt a pregnant woman so that her child departs from her,</b> and yet no harm follow, he shall be punished as imposed upon him by the woman’s husband” (Exodus 21:22). <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: The verse is speaking of a quarrel that involves death,</b> i.e., they sought to kill each other, <b>as it is written: “And if any harm follow, then you shall give a soul for a soul”</b> (Exodus 21:23). |
| Exodus 21:22 | the Merciful One states: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished” | Ketubot 33a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If they did not forewarn one</b> not to kill the other, <b>why is he killed</b> if the death of his opponent ensues? <b>Rather, obviously</b> it is a case <b>where they forewarned him, and</b> the principle is that <b>one who is forewarned with regard to a severe matter,</b> murdering his counterpart, <b>is forewarned with regard to a lesser matter,</b> injuring his counterpart. <b>And</b> although he is forewarned against injuring another, which violates a prohibition and is punishable by lashes, <b>the Merciful One states: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished”</b> (Exodus 21:22), indicating that one pays and is not flogged. |
| Exodus 21:22 | “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished | Ketubot 34b:10 | <b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from the following verse, which describes a case where two people fought and during their struggle they hurt a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: <b>“And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished</b> as imposed upon him by the woman’s husband” (Exodus 21:22). |
| Exodus 21:22 | Reish Lakish: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished” | Ketubot 35a:1 | <b>Is</b> this <b>not</b> referring to <b>actual harm,</b> i.e., the woman’s death? And the verse states that he pays only if she did not die, but if she died is he exempt, even if he was not forewarned? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse can be explained to mean: If there is no <b>sentence of harm.</b> If the court does not actually sentence him to death, he pays the damages for the miscarried fetus. He is exempt from payment only if he is actually executed. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this exchange: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished”</b> (Exodus 21:22); <b>is</b> this <b>not</b> referring to <b>a sentence of harm?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse can be explained to mean: If there is no <b>actual harm.</b> |
| Exodus 21:22 | does not pay money, as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished” | Ketubot 36b:7 | The mishna resumes its list of the cases of young women who are not entitled to a fine when raped or seduced by the following men: In the case of <b>one who engages in intercourse with his daughter, with his daughter’s daughter, with his son’s daughter, with his wife’s daughter, with her son’s daughter,</b> or <b>with her daughter’s daughter; they do not</b> receive payment of <b>a fine.</b> That is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, and <b>that their death</b> penalty is administered by <b>the court, and anyone who is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>does not pay money, as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished”</b> (Exodus 21:22). This verse indicates that if a woman dies and the one who struck her is liable to receive the death penalty, he is exempt from payment. |
| Exodus 21:22 | as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished, etc.” | Ketubot 37a:8 | § The mishna states that one liable to receive the death penalty is exempt from payment, <b>as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished, etc.”</b> (Exodus 21:22). The Gemara asks: <b>And is this</b> principle <b>derived from here?</b> Actually, <b>it is derived from there:</b> “And to be beaten before his face <b>according to the measure of his iniquity”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). From the term: His iniquity, it is inferred: <b>You can hold</b> one who performs one action <b>liable for one iniquity,</b> i.e., punishment for violating one prohibition, <b>but you do not hold him liable for two iniquities,</b> i.e., punishments for violating two prohibitions. |
| Exodus 21:22 | and imposition is stated above, | Makkot 2b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who abandon the straightforward meaning of the verse? The Rabbis derive it in the following manner: <b>Imposition is stated below</b> with regard to one whose ox killed another: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposition is stated above,</b> in the case of one who struck a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman imposes upon him” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the miscarriage, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim,</b> the fetus, that we assess the payment, <b>here too,</b> in the case of the ransom, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim</b> that we assess the payment. |
| Exodus 21:22 | only to judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges determine [ bifelilim ]” | Megillah 15b:6 | The Attribute of Justice <b>said to Him: “These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink;</b> the priest and the prophet reel through strong drink, they are confused because of wine, they stagger because of strong drink; they reel in vision, <b>they stumble [<i>paku</i>] in judgment [<i>peliliyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:7). The word <b><i>paku</i></b> in this context is referring <b>only to Gehenna, as it is stated: “That this shall not be a cause of stumbling [<i>puka</i>] to you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31), <b>and</b> the word <b><i>peliliyya</i></b> here is referring <b>only to judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges determine [<i>bifelilim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:22). The response of the Attribute of Justice was essentially that the Jewish people have also sinned and are consequently liable to receive punishment. |
| Exodus 21:22 | nothing other than judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges [ biflilim ] determine” | Sanhedrin 111b:5 | <b>The attribute of justice said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, how do these</b> people, who possess these qualities, <b>differ from those</b> who engage in Torah study but lack these qualities? God <b>said to</b> the attribute of justice that those others do not receive the crown and diadem because: <b>“These also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink…they stumble [<i>paku</i>] in judgment [<i>peliliyya</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 28:7). <b>And <i>puka</i></b> in this context is referring to <b>nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That this shall not be a cause of stumbling [<i>puka</i>] for you”</b> (I Samuel 25:31). <b>And</b> the term of <b><i>pelila</i></b> in the verse in Isaiah is referring to <b>nothing other than judges, as it is stated: “And he shall pay as the judges [<i>biflilim</i>] determine”</b> (Exodus 21:22). Those who lack the qualities listed in the previous verses are not worthy of the aforementioned reward. |
| Exodus 21:22 | What is the reason of Rabbi Yonatan ben Shaul? As it is written: “If men strive | Sanhedrin 74a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yonatan ben Shaul? As it is written: “If men strive</b> and strike a woman with child, so that her fruit departs, and yet no further harm ensues, he shall be punished, according to the demands that the woman’s husband makes on him; and he shall pay it as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). <b>And</b> concerning this <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The verse is speaking of striving to kill,</b> where each man was trying to kill the other. The proof is <b>that it is written: “But if any harm ensues, then you shall give life for life”</b> (Exodus 21:23), and if there was no intention to kill, why should he be executed? <b>And even so, the Merciful One states: “And yet no further harm ensues, he shall be punished,”</b> teaching that he must pay the monetary value of the fetus to the woman’s husband. |
| Exodus 21:22 | which is written: “If men struggle and they hurt a pregnant woman | Sanhedrin 79a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that if <b>one intended to kill this</b> individual <b>and he killed that</b> individual he is <b>liable,</b> there is support for their opinion from that <b>which is written: “If men struggle and they hurt a pregnant woman</b> so that her child departs from her, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). It can be inferred form the verse that if there is a tragedy, i.e., if the woman dies, there is no payment of restitution. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It is <b>with regard to a quarrel that involves</b> the intent of each to cause the <b>death</b> of the other that <b>the verse is speaking, as it is written: “But if there shall be a tragedy then you shall give a life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). This is proof that in a case where one intended to kill one individual and he killed a pregnant woman instead, he is liable to be executed, which is why he does not pay restitution. |
| Exodus 21:22 | giving above: | Sanhedrin 79b:1 | <b>giving above:</b> “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> in the phrase: “Give as the judges determine,” the reference is to <b>monetary restitution, so too here,</b> in the phrase: “Give a life for a life,” the reference is to <b>monetary restitution.</b> |
| Exodus 21:23 | “You shall give a life for a life” | Bava Kamma84a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for”</b> as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <b>from</b> the word <b>“for”</b> as stated with regard to <b>an ox? Let us learn</b> a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for”</b> as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <b>from</b> the word <b>“for”</b> as stated with regard to <b>a person, as it is written</b> about one who kills another: <b>“You shall give a life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). <b>Just as there,</b> the court punishes the guilty party by taking his <b>actual</b> life, <b>so too here,</b> why not say that the court should take his <b>actual</b> eye? |
| Exodus 21:23 | “A life for a life” | Bava Kamma84a:9 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Abaye says</b> that this principle is <b>derived from</b> that which <b>was taught</b> by <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> that the Torah states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), and: <b>“A life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23), <b>but not an eye and a life for an eye. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse means this <b>literally,</b> there could be <b>times when you find</b> a case where both <b>an eye and a life</b> are taken <b>for an eye,</b> i.e., when the one who caused the damage is so weak <b>that as</b> the court <b>blinds</b> his eye, <b>his soul departs</b> from his body. |
| Exodus 21:23 | life for life” | Chagigah 11a:8 | The Gemara elaborates. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> “But if any harm follow, then you shall give <b>life for life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). This verse is referring to a payment of <b>money.</b> Do <b>you say money, or</b> perhaps <b>it is solely an actual life</b> that is demanded? The term <b>giving is stated below:</b> “You shall give life for life,” <b>and giving is stated above,</b> in the previous verse: “And he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> the giving is in the form of <b>money, so too here,</b> it is referring to a payment of <b>money.</b> Although this <i>halakha</i> is not explicit in the Torah, the verses lend support to it. |
| Exodus 21:23 | harm at the hands of man, | Ketubot 30a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana? Abaye said: It states</b> the word <b>harm at the hands of man,</b> in the verse “But if any harm follow, then you shall give a soul for a soul” (Exodus 21:23) and <b>it states</b> the word <b>harm at the hand of Heaven,</b> in the verse in which Jacob states: “My son shall not descend with you…and harm befalls him on the way” (Genesis 42:38). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>harm that is stated at the hands of man,</b> e.g., one who kills and is liable to be executed, one is <b>exempt from the</b> associated <b>payment, so too,</b> with regard to <b>harm that is stated at the hand of Heaven,</b> one is <b>exempt from the</b> associated <b>payment.</b> |
| Exodus 21:23 | as it is written: “And if any harm follow, then you shall give a soul for a soul” | Ketubot 33a:8 | § <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The fact that in the case of <b>one who injures another as well he pays money and is not flogged</b> is derived not by means of a verbal analogy but <b>from here: “If men quarrel and hurt a pregnant woman so that her child departs from her,</b> and yet no harm follow, he shall be punished as imposed upon him by the woman’s husband” (Exodus 21:22). <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: The verse is speaking of a quarrel that involves death,</b> i.e., they sought to kill each other, <b>as it is written: “And if any harm follow, then you shall give a soul for a soul”</b> (Exodus 21:23). |
| Exodus 21:23 | the Rabbis, who said | Ketubot 33b:2 | With regard to the basic proof from the case of the two men quarreling, <b>Rav Ya’akov from Nehar Pekod</b> strongly <b>objects to this. This</b> works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who said</b> that the verse “And you shall give a soul for a soul” (Exodus 21:23) is referring to <b>an actual life,</b> and that if he caused the woman’s death he is executed. <b>However, according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that if he did not intend to injure the woman he is not liable to be executed and instead pays <b>money</b> as indemnity for causing her death, <b>what can be said?</b> According to that opinion, there was no forewarning for lashes at all, and the only liability is payment for injuring another. |
| Exodus 21:23 | that it is written: “But if any harm ensues, then you shall give life for life” | Sanhedrin 74a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yonatan ben Shaul? As it is written: “If men strive</b> and strike a woman with child, so that her fruit departs, and yet no further harm ensues, he shall be punished, according to the demands that the woman’s husband makes on him; and he shall pay it as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). <b>And</b> concerning this <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The verse is speaking of striving to kill,</b> where each man was trying to kill the other. The proof is <b>that it is written: “But if any harm ensues, then you shall give life for life”</b> (Exodus 21:23), and if there was no intention to kill, why should he be executed? <b>And even so, the Merciful One states: “And yet no further harm ensues, he shall be punished,”</b> teaching that he must pay the monetary value of the fetus to the woman’s husband. |
| Exodus 21:23 | the verse is speaking, as it is written: “But if there shall be a tragedy then you shall give a life for a life” | Sanhedrin 79a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that if <b>one intended to kill this</b> individual <b>and he killed that</b> individual he is <b>liable,</b> there is support for their opinion from that <b>which is written: “If men struggle and they hurt a pregnant woman</b> so that her child departs from her, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22). It can be inferred form the verse that if there is a tragedy, i.e., if the woman dies, there is no payment of restitution. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It is <b>with regard to a quarrel that involves</b> the intent of each to cause the <b>death</b> of the other that <b>the verse is speaking, as it is written: “But if there shall be a tragedy then you shall give a life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). This is proof that in a case where one intended to kill one individual and he killed a pregnant woman instead, he is liable to be executed, which is why he does not pay restitution. |
| Exodus 21:23 | giving is stated below: | Sanhedrin 79a:11 | <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon, this</b> verse: <b>“Then you shall give a life for a life,” what does he do with it?</b> According to his opinion, the party to the quarrel is exempt from the punishment of execution in this case. The Gemara answers: According to Rabbi Shimon, “a life for a life” is not referring to execution; rather, the reference is to <b>monetary restitution. And</b> this understanding is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the phrase <b>“then you shall give a life for a life”</b> does not mean execution, but rather <b>monetary restitution</b> for the life that he took. <b>Do you say</b> that it means <b>monetary restitution, or</b> does <b>it</b> mean <b>only</b> the taking of <b>an actual life?</b> Based on the language employed in the verse, it can be determined that the reference is to monetary payment. In these verses, a term of <b>giving is stated below:</b> “And you shall give a life for a life” (Exodus 21:23). <b>And</b> additionally, a term <b>is stated</b> of |
| Exodus 21:23 | and giving is stated below: | Sanhedrin 87b:11 | The <i>tanna</i> deliberates: <b>Do you say</b> that the reference is to <b>a monetary payment, or</b> perhaps the reference is <b>only</b> to giving his <b>actual life?</b> Based on the language employed in the verse, it can be determined that the reference is to monetary payment. In these verses, <b>giving is stated above:</b> “And you shall give a life for a life,” <b>and giving is stated below:</b> “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:23). <b>Just as there,</b> in the phrase “Give as the judges determine,” the reference is to <b>monetary payment, so too here,</b> in the phrase “Give a life for a life,” the reference is to <b>monetary payment.</b> The Rabbis hold that the reference is to giving his actual life. If an heir of the victim betrothed a woman with money seized from the assailant, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the woman is betrothed, while according to the Rabbis she is not betrothed. |
| Exodus 21:24 | “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma83b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna take for granted the fact that one who caused injury is liable to pay compensation to the injured party? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24). You might <b>say</b> that this means that the one who caused injury shall lose <b>an actual eye</b> rather than pay money. |
| Exodus 21:24 | as it is taught | Bava Kamma83b:8 | The Gemara responds: That interpretation should <b>not enter your mind.</b> The principle implicit in the mishna is derived from a verbal analogy in the Torah, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Based on the verse: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot” (Exodus 21:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that if one <b>blinded the eye of</b> another, the court <b>blinds his eye</b> as punishment; or if one <b>severed the hand of</b> another, the court <b>severs his hand;</b> or if one <b>broke the leg of</b> another, the court <b>breaks his leg.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One who strikes a person,”</b> and the verse also states: <b>“And one who strikes an animal,”</b> to teach that <b>just as one who strikes an animal</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation, so too, one who strikes a person</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation.</b> |
| Exodus 21:24 | damage. And if it enters your mind | Bava Kamma84a:11 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rabba</b> that the <b>verse states: “A wound for a wound”</b> (Exodus 21:25), to teach that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>pain,</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), refers to the removal of <b>an actual</b> eye from the one who injured the other, then <b>just as</b> it is so that the injured party <b>has pain</b> from the loss of his eye, the one who caused him injury <b>also has pain</b> when the court removes his eye; why then does the Torah require that he pay compensation for pain as well? |
| Exodus 21:24 | damage. And if it enters your mind | Bava Kamma84a:13 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava</b> that concerning one who was injured by another, who must pay for damage, the <b>verse states:</b> “If he rises again, and walks outside upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be absolved; only he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, <b>and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), which teaches that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>medical costs</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), is referring to an <b>actual</b> eye, then <b>just as</b> it is so <b>that</b> the injured party <b>needs healing,</b> the one who caused him the injury <b>also needs healing</b> after the court removes his eye; why, then, does the Torah require that he pay compensation for medical costs as well? |
| Exodus 21:24 | It is written here: “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma84a:15 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the fact that one who injures another pays monetary restitution <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to injuries caused to people <b>from</b> the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to <b>an ox</b> that gored another ox. <b>It is written here: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to a forewarned ox that gored the ox of another: <b>“He shall pay an ox for an ox”</b> (Exodus 21:36). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse does not mean that the owner pays compensation with an actual ox, but rather pays <b>monetary restitution, so too here,</b> one who injures another pays <b>monetary restitution.</b> |
| Exodus 21:24 | “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma84a:19 | § It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The verse that states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), is referring to <b>an actual</b> eye. The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the verse is referring to <b>an actual</b> eye? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer</b> understand the verse <b>like all these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who explained that this verse is referring to monetary payment? |
| Exodus 21:24 | “An eye for an eye” | Bava Kamma84a:9 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Abaye says</b> that this principle is <b>derived from</b> that which <b>was taught</b> by <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> that the Torah states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), and: <b>“A life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23), <b>but not an eye and a life for an eye. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse means this <b>literally,</b> there could be <b>times when you find</b> a case where both <b>an eye and a life</b> are taken <b>for an eye,</b> i.e., when the one who caused the damage is so weak <b>that as</b> the court <b>blinds</b> his eye, <b>his soul departs</b> from his body. |
| Exodus 21:24 | “An eye for [ taḥat ] an eye” | Ketubot 32b:1 | <b>Rather, Ulla derives</b> the fact that one pays and is not flogged by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>for</b> and <b>for.</b> The verse <b>states</b> with regard to rape: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and to him she shall be as a wife, <b>because [<i>taḥat</i>] he tormented her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>and it states there,</b> with regard to injury: <b>“An eye for [<i>taḥat</i>] an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to injury, one <b>pays money</b> and <b>is not flogged,</b> so too, in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes,</b> one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged.</b> |
| Exodus 21:24 | “An eye for an eye” | Ketubot 38a:4 | <b>Rather, Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that the phrase “any <i>ḥerem</i>” (Leviticus 27:29) is <b>necessary, as it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one who is liable to be executed is exempt from payment, <b>applies only</b> in a case <b>where one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye and killed him with</b> that same blow. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye and killed him by</b> means of a <b>different</b> blow, <b>say: Let us take money from him</b> to pay the damage inflicted to the eye. Therefore, the verse teaches that this is not the case. <b>Rava said to him: This</b> case of one who blinded another’s eye and killed him <b>is also derived from</b> that which <b>another <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya</b> taught, <b>as</b> the Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), from which it may be inferred, <b>but not an eye and a life for an eye.</b> When he gives his life for killing another while blinding him, he need not pay the worth of the eye as well. |
| Exodus 21:25 | Ḥizkiyya says, and similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states: “Wound for wound [ petza taḥat patza ]” | Bava Kamma26b:1 | With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one must pay the full cost of the damage in a case where there was no intent to cause damage, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya says, and similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states: “Wound for wound [<i>petza taḥat patza</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:25). This phrase is superfluous, as the Torah states elsewhere (see Leviticus 24:19) that one is liable to pay compensation when injuring another. This verse serves <b>to render him liable</b> to pay <b>for the unintentional</b> damage just <b>as</b> he pays <b>for the intentional</b> damage; <b>and</b> he pays <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>accident</b> just <b>as</b> he pays <b>for</b> damage caused <b>willingly.</b> |
| Exodus 21:25 | verse states: “A wound for a wound” | Bava Kamma84a:11 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rabba</b> that the <b>verse states: “A wound for a wound”</b> (Exodus 21:25), to teach that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>pain,</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), refers to the removal of <b>an actual</b> eye from the one who injured the other, then <b>just as</b> it is so that the injured party <b>has pain</b> from the loss of his eye, the one who caused him injury <b>also has pain</b> when the court removes his eye; why then does the Torah require that he pay compensation for pain as well? |
| Exodus 21:25 | difference | Bava Kamma84a:12 | The Gemara objects: <b>And what</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps there is a person who is delicate,</b> so <b>he has more pain, and there is a person who is not delicate,</b> so <b>he does not have</b> the same amount of <b>pain.</b> Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for pain. <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> when the Torah states: “A wound for a wound” (Exodus 21:25)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <b>to give</b> the injured party compensation for <b>the difference between</b> them in pain tolerance. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rav Zevid. |
| Exodus 21:25 | ben Azzai, as it is taught | Bava Kamma84b:14 | § The Gemara returns to its discussion of the mishna, which states: How is payment for <b>pain</b> assessed? If <b>one burned</b> another <b>with a skewer or with a</b> hot <b>nail,</b> or even if he burned him on his fingernail, where he would not cause a bruise that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court evaluates how much money a person with a similar threshold for pain as the victim is willing to take in order to be made to suffer in this way. The Gemara comments: This teaches that even when the <b>pain</b> is <b>not in a place</b> that causes <b>damage</b> to the injured party, the one who caused the injury must <b>pay</b> compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this statement? <b>Rava said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: “<i>Keviyya</i> for <i>keviyya</i>, a wound for a wound, <i>ḥabura</i> for <i>ḥabura</i>” (Exodus 21:25), <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A burn [<i>keviyya</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse, and <b>ben Azzai says: A bruise [<i>ḥabura</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse. |
| Exodus 21:25 | with regard to a generalization and a detail that are distant from each other. | Bava Kamma85a:1 | Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai <b>disagree</b> over whether the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail is applied <b>with regard to a generalization and a detail that are distant from each other.</b> When a generalization is followed by a detail, the <i>halakha</i> applies only in the case specified in the detail. The verse states: “<i>Keviyya</i> for <i>keviyya</i>, a wound for a wound, <i>ḥabura</i> for <i>ḥabura</i>” (Exodus 21:25). The word “<i>keviyya</i>,” as stated in the beginning of the verse, is a generalization that includes burns not accompanied by bruises as well as burns accompanied by bruises. “<i>Ḥabura</i>,” as stated at the end of the verse, is a detail of a burn that is accompanied by a bruise. The Torah distances the detail, “<i>ḥabura</i>,” from the generalization, “<i>keviyya</i>,” by stating the <i>halakha</i> of: “A wound for a wound” between them. |
| Exodus 21:25 | Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: The verse states: “A wound for a wound” | Bava Kamma85a:23 | § With regard to compensation for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And all of these</b> types of indemnity <b>are paid in a case</b> where the one who caused injury must also pay compensation for <b>damage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: The verse states: “A wound for a wound”</b> (Exodus 21:25), to teach that the one who caused injury is liable <b>to give</b> compensation for <b>pain in a case of damage.</b> |
| Exodus 21:26 | “And destroy it” | Bava Kamma26b:5 | By contrast, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The slave is not emancipated in these cases because the verse states: <b>“And destroy it”</b> (Exodus 21:26), from which it is derived that the slave is emancipated <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the master <b>intends to destroy</b> the eye or the tooth, but not if he intended to heal the slave. So too, in the case where a stone fell and accidentally blinded a slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth, according to the Rabbis the slave would be emancipated and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel he would not. All of the above cases relate to situations where the individual did not know the stone was in his lap. |
| Exodus 21:26 | the verse states: | Bava Kamma74b:2 | <b>Abaye said</b> to him in response: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man smites the eye of his slave or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26). The phrase <b>“for his eye’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> The same can be inferred from the subsequent verse: “And if he smites out his bondman’s tooth or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). The phrase <b>“for his tooth’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> |
| Exodus 21:26 | his slave” | Bava Kamma90a:12 | He explains: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that the term <b>“his money”</b> indicates a slave <b>that is unique to him? Here too,</b> since the verse states with regard to the emancipation of a slave resulting from his master striking him: “And if a man smite the eye of <b>his slave”</b> (Exodus 21:26), this is referring to his slave <b>that is unique to him.</b> Therefore, this <i>halakha</i> of emancipation would not apply to a slave not fully owned by one master. |
| Exodus 21:26 | slave | Kiddushin 20a:6 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> concerning the following verse, which is referring to a Hebrew slave: <b>“If he comes in <i>begappo</i> he shall leave <i>begappo</i>”</b> (Exodus 21:3), which means that if <b>he enters with his body [<i>begufo</i>] he shall leave with his body [<i>begufo</i>]. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If <b>he enters alone he shall leave alone.</b> The Gemara clarifies. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the ruling that if <b>he enters with his body he shall leave with his body? Rava said:</b> This means <b>to say that he is not released through</b> the loss of his <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> (Exodus 21:26), meaning he does not leave his master because of damage done to his body. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from a different verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7). |
| Exodus 21:26 | and destroys it, | Kiddushin 24b:15 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:9): In a case <b>where his master was a doctor and</b> the slave <b>said to him to paint his eye</b> with a medicament, <b>and</b> the master <b>blinded it</b> in the process, or he asked him <b>to drill his</b> aching <b>tooth, and</b> the master <b>knocked it out,</b> the slave <b>laughs at the master and is emancipated. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that the verse: “And if a man smites the eye of his slave, or the eye of his maidservant, <b>and destroys it,</b> to freedom shall he send him for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26), means that the slave is not emancipated <b>unless</b> the master <b>intends to destroy it.</b> If he intended to heal him, the slave is not freed, even if the master did, in fact, injure him. |
| Exodus 21:26 | smites” | Kiddushin 24b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> the following argument: <b>“If</b> a man <b>smites”</b> (Exodus 21:26), is <b>a generalization; “a tooth” and “an eye”</b> are each <b>a detail.</b> If so, this should be read as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and the hermeneutical principle in a case of this kind is that <b>the generalization includes only what is</b> mentioned explicitly <b>in the detail.</b> Consequently, <b>a tooth and an eye are</b> included, but <b>not other matters.</b> |
| Exodus 21:27 | his eye and his tooth. | Bava Kamma74b:2 | <b>Abaye said</b> to him in response: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man smites the eye of his slave or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26). The phrase <b>“for his eye’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> The same can be inferred from the subsequent verse: “And if he smites out his bondman’s tooth or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). The phrase <b>“for his tooth’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> |
| Exodus 21:27 | his tooth, | Gittin 42b:10 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If the master <b>knocked out</b> the slave’s <b>tooth and</b> then <b>blinded his eye,</b> then the slave <b>is emancipated due to</b> the loss of <b>his tooth,</b> as the verse states: “He shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). <b>And</b> his master <b>gives him</b> reimbursement for <b>the value of his eye,</b> as though he were a freeman. <b>And if you say</b> that a slave that did not yet receive a bill of manumission <b>does</b> render one whose ox kills him liable to pay the <b>penalty, and the penalty is</b> paid <b>to his master,</b> then one could ask: <b>Now</b> if <b>other</b> people <b>injure him,</b> then they <b>give</b> the payment <b>to his master;</b> if <b>his master himself injures him,</b> then <b>should he give</b> the payment for the slave’s eye <b>to him?</b> |
| Exodus 21:28 | “The ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten” | Avodah Zarah34b:15 | <b>If you wish, cite a verse: It is written here,</b> with regard to an animal used for idol worship: <b>“And there shall cleave naught</b> of the dedicated thing <b>to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), which indicates that the entire animal is forbidden. <b>And it is written there,</b> with regard to an ox to be stoned: <b>“The ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 21:28). This teaches that <b>its flesh is forbidden, but its excrement is permitted.</b> |
| Exodus 21:28 | gores | Bava Kamma2b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>goring that it is characterized</b> as <b>a primary category</b> of damage, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly in the verse: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <b><i>negifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> be characterized as a primary category, <b>as it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>negifa</i></b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is</b> actually a reference to <b>goring, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <b>began</b> its description of the case <b>with</b> the term <b><i>negifa</i> and</b> it <b>concluded with</b> the term <b>goring to say to you</b> that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <b>This</b> action <b>is <i>negifa</i></b> and <b>this</b> same action <b>is goring.</b> |
| Exodus 21:28 | gores | Bava Kamma2b:11 | The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <b>what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>a person that it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>an animal that it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? |
| Exodus 21:28 | gores | Bava Kamma2b:4 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive the primary category of <b>Goring?</b> The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <b>goring is</b> performed <b>only</b> with <b>a horn, as it is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and said: So says the Lord: With these shall you gore the Arameans,</b> until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). |
| Exodus 21:28 | if an ox gores | Bava Kamma39a:6 | If <b>a stadium [<i>ha’itztadin</i>] ox,</b> i.e., one that is trained to fight in a stadium, gores and kills a person, it <b>is not liable</b> to be put to <b>death, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>if an ox gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28). This is referring only to an ox that gores on its own initiative, <b>but not to</b> the case of an ox where others <b>induced it to gore.</b> Therefore, the owner of a stadium ox, which is trained to gore, is exempt from liability if it does. |
| Exodus 21:28 | death, | Bava Kamma40b:22 | <b>So too, it is reasonable, as if you say</b> that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to</b> the animal’s eligibility to be brought as <b>an offering,</b> how can the <i>baraita</i> state the following: By contrast, with regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> the Torah <b>does not render</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully. Neither</b> are <b>circumstances beyond its control written</b> in that context, <b>nor is its willingness written;</b> the issue is not mentioned in the Torah at all. <b>Rather,</b> is the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> the animal being put to <b>death,</b> where this distinction is indicated in the Torah? The mishna interprets the phrase: “And if an ox gores” (Exodus 21:28), as indicating that the ox is not put to death in a case where it is induced to gore; therefore, this distinction is mentioned in the Torah with regard to the animal being put to death. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> does not address the topic of dispute between Rav and Shmuel. |
| Exodus 21:28 | the ox shall be stoned, | Bava Kamma41a:17 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> both <b>this</b> forewarned ox <b>and that</b> innocuous ox <b>are liable</b> to be put to <b>death. The Sages taught:</b> We learn <b>by inference from</b> that <b>which is stated</b> with regard to an ox that killed a person: “And if an ox gores a man or a woman, that they die, <b>the ox shall be stoned,</b> and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <b>Don’t I know</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the stoning makes it an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass? What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten”? The verse is telling you that</b> even <b>if one slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict had been reached</b> but before it was stoned, it is still <b>prohibited to eat</b> it. |
| Exodus 21:28 | “When an ox gores a man or a woman, | Bava Kamma42b:14 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <b>and it killed a man or a woman;</b> the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If</b> it is <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a woman</b> just <b>as</b> for the killing of <b>a man, this is already stated</b> with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <b>“When an ox gores a man or a woman,</b> and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28). |
| Exodus 21:28 | in Jerusalem for killing a person, | Berakhot 27a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified</b> about <b>five matters of</b> <i>halakha</i>: <br>When an orphan girl, who was married off by her mother or brother before reaching the age of majority, reaches the age of majority, she may refuse to continue living with her husband and thereby retroactively annul their marriage. Normally, marriage refusals are discouraged. However, in specific instances where it is clear that if the marriage were to remain in effect it would engender problems related to levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified that <b>one may persuade the minor girl to refuse</b> to continue living with her husband, thereby resolving the complications involved in this case.<br><b>And</b> he testified <b>that one may</b> allow <b>a woman</b> who, after hearing of her husband’s death, seeks to remarry, <b>to marry based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> as opposed to the two witnesses required for other testimonies of the Torah. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about a rooster that was stoned</b> to death <b>in Jerusalem for killing a person,</b> in order to teach that the Torah law (Exodus 21:28) which requires the stoning of an ox that killed a person, applies to other animals as well. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about forty-day-old wine that was</b> used for <b>libation on the altar.</b> <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours</b> of the day. |
| Exodus 21:28 | “And if an ox gore a man” | Berakhot 56b:15 | <b>One who sees an ox in a dream,</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“And if an ox gore a man”</b> (Exodus 21:28). |
| Exodus 21:28 | the ox shall be stoned, | Kiddushin 56b:7 | The Gemara continues its analysis of the mishna: <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is taught <b>by inference from</b> that <b>which is stated</b> with regard to an ox that killed a person: “And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, <b>the ox shall be stoned,</b> and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <b>Don’t I know</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the stoning makes it an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass? What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten”?</b> The verse <b>is telling you that</b> even <b>if one slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict had been reached</b> but before it was stoned, it is still <b>prohibited to eat</b> it. |
| Exodus 21:28 | and of its flesh shall not be eaten; | Pesachim 22b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition against eating the meat from <b>an ox that is stoned, as the Merciful One says:</b> “And if an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, <b>and of its flesh shall not be eaten;</b> but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>By inference from that which is stated: “The ox shall surely be stoned,”</b> in which case it is not to be slaughtered properly, <b>don’t I know that it is an animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat an animal carcass? What</b> does it mean when <b>the verse states: “Its</b> flesh <b>shall not be eaten”? The verse is telling you that</b> even <b>if one slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict had been reached</b> but before it had been carried out, <b>it is</b> still <b>prohibited.</b> |
| Exodus 21:28 | its flesh shall not be eaten” | Temurah 30b:7 | <b>If you wish, say</b> that this is learned from <b>a verse: It is written with regard to</b> an animal used for <b>idol worship:</b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>and be [<i>vehayita</i>] accursed like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). This teaches that <b>anything that you create [<i>mehayye</i>] from</b> the idol <b>is</b> prohibited <b>like</b> the idol <b>itself.</b> But <b>with regard to an ox that is stoned, it is written:</b> “The ox shall surely be stoned, and <b>its flesh shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 21:28). This teaches that only <b>its flesh is forbidden,</b> but <b>its excrement is permitted.</b> |
| Exodus 21:29 | it is written: “And warning has been given to its owner” | Bava Batra28b:5 | The Gemara answers: This is not difficult. <b>There,</b> with regard to a forewarned ox, <b>it is written: “And warning has been given to its owner”</b> (Exodus 21:29), indicating that the warning must be issued in the presence of the owner. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the protest, <b>your friend has a friend, and the friend of your friend has a friend,</b> so that the protest will become known even if lodged not in the presence of the possessor, as word of it will spread. There is no Torah edict mandating that the protest be lodged in his presence, and it is sufficient that he hears of it, even secondhand. |
| Exodus 21:29 | “And warning has been given to its owner and he has not secured it” | Bava Kamma112b:8 | § Having discussed testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara addresses a similar matter. <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court <b>does not ratify a document in the absence of a litigant. Rav Sheshet said to Rabbi Yosei bar Abbahu: I will explain Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reasoning to you. The verse states</b> with regard to an ox that gored: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner and he has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The Torah</b> means to <b>say:</b> Let <b>the owner of the ox come and stand by his ox</b> when the testimony about the ox is provided. Similarly, a document may be ratified only in the presence of the individual it implicates. |
| Exodus 21:29 | and it killed a man | Bava Kamma13b:13 | <b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> is that an ox that kills a person is stoned to death. The mishna states (44b) that this does not apply to an ox consecrated to the Temple or an ownerless ox. <b>Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said: Even</b> if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently consecrated</b> it to the Temple, or if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently declared</b> it <b>ownerless,</b> the owner <b>is exempt</b> from liability, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if the ox was wont to gore in time past, <b>and had been forewarned with its owner,</b> and he had not guarded it in, <b>and it killed a man</b> or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and also its owner shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:29). The repetition of the reference to the owner at the beginning and end of the verse indicates that the ox is not stoned <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial is the same,</b> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for both events. |
| Exodus 21:29 | “And it killed a man or a woman” | Bava Kamma15a:6 | <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to liability in a case where one’s ox kills a person: <b>“And it killed a man or a woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all killings in the Torah,</b> i.e., the liability incurred is the same whether the person killed was a man or a woman. |
| Exodus 21:29 | in the presence of the steward. | Bava Kamma39a:4 | <b>If an ox belonging to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored</b> another ox and caused damage, <b>the court appoints a steward for them and warns them</b> with regard to the ox that gored <b>in the presence of the steward.</b> The ox is thereby rendered a forewarned ox, since the steward is considered its owner with regard to the requirement of the verse: “And warning has been given to its owner” (Exodus 21:29). |
| Exodus 21:29 | and it killed a man or a woman; | Bava Kamma42b:14 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <b>and it killed a man or a woman;</b> the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If</b> it is <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a woman</b> just <b>as</b> for the killing of <b>a man, this is already stated</b> with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <b>“When an ox gores a man or a woman,</b> and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28). |
| Exodus 21:29 | because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death” | Bava Kamma44b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers that it is <b>because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29); the juxtaposition of the ox and its owner indicates that <b>as the death of the owner,</b> i.e., a person, for killing another person, <b>so</b> is <b>the death of the ox</b> for killing a person. In other words, the two <i>halakhot</i> are applied in the same circumstances. Specifically, <b>just as the owner,</b> i.e., a person, is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment <b>unless he intends</b> to kill the person whom he ultimately kills, <b>so too, an ox</b> is not put to death <b>either, unless it intends</b> to kill the one whom it ultimately kills. |
| Exodus 21:29 | and it killed | Bava Kamma44b:19 | <b>This</b> assertion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>even if it gored and he ultimately consecrated</b> it, or if <b>it gored and he ultimately renounced ownership</b> over it, the ox is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And warning has been given [<i>vehuad</i>] to its owner</b>…<b>and it killed</b>…the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). It is derived from here that the owner of the ox is exempt <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial is the same,</b> i.e., that the ox has an owner. |
| Exodus 21:29 | “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death” | Bava Kamma45a:7 | According to this explanation, <b>what is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the ox’s verdict can be issued only in its presence? The verse states: <b>“The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29), indicating that <b>as the death of the owner,</b> i.e., a person, for killing another person, <b>so</b> is <b>the death of the ox</b> for killing a person. <b>Just as the owner</b> is sentenced to death only <b>in his presence, so too, an ox</b> is sentenced to death only <b>in its presence.</b> |
| Exodus 21:29 | “And killed a man or woman” | Kiddushin 35a:9 | <b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer taught</b> as follows. <b>The verse states:</b> “Now these are the ordinances <b>which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1), stating “them” in the plural. This <b>verse equates a woman to a man</b> with regard <b>to all judgments in the Torah,</b> i.e., monetary cases and damages. <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states,</b> with regard to the ransom one pays if his animal killed a person: <b>“And killed a man or woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). Here too, <b>the verse equates a woman to a man,</b> with regard <b>to all deaths in the Torah,</b> i.e., the same <i>halakha</i> applies to an animal that kills either a man or a woman. |
| Exodus 21:29 | as it is stated: “The ox shall be stoned and also its owner shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 15a:15 | § The mishna teaches that <b>an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned</b> is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated: “The ox shall be stoned and also its owner shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29). From this verse it is derived that just <b>as</b> the manner of <b>the death of the owner, so is</b> the manner of <b>the death of the ox.</b> Consequently, it follows that twenty-three judges are necessary to adjudicate the case of the ox that is to be stoned. <b>Abaye said to Rava: From where</b> do we know <b>that this</b> phrase: <b>“And also its owner shall be put to death,” comes to</b> teach <b>that</b> just <b>as</b> the manner of <b>the death of the owner, so is</b> the manner of <b>the death of the ox?</b> |
| Exodus 21:29 | “He should be testified against with his owner” | Sanhedrin 19a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>But what is the reason</b> that others <b>do not</b> judge <b>the kings of Israel?</b> It is <b>because of an incident that happened, as the slave of Yannai the king killed a person. Shimon ben Shataḥ said to the Sages: Put your eyes on him and let us judge him. They sent</b> word <b>to</b> Yannai: <b>Your slave killed a person.</b> Yannai <b>sent</b> the slave <b>to them. They sent</b> word <b>to</b> Yannai: <b>You also come here,</b> as the verse states with regard to an ox that gored a person to death: <b>“He should be testified against with his owner”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The Torah stated: The owner of the ox should come and stand over his ox.</b> |
| Exodus 21:29 | the ox shall be stoned and also its owner shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 2a:10 | Similarly, <b>an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned</b> because it killed a person is judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning has been given to its owner, but he did not guard it and it kills a man or a woman <b>the ox shall be stoned and also its owner shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29). From this verse it is derived that <b>just as</b> the manner of <b>the death of the owner, so is</b> the manner of <b>the death of the ox.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies in the case of <b>a wolf or a lion, a bear or a leopard, or a cheetah, or a snake</b> that killed a person: <b>Their death</b> is decreed <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> these dangerous animals do not need to be brought to court; rather, <b>anyone who kills them first merits</b> the performance of a mitzva. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Their death</b> is decreed <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. |
| Exodus 21:29 | the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned and its owner shall also be put to death” | Sanhedrin 78a:14 | <b>And Rava says: An ox</b> that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that killed</b> an individual is <b>liable</b> to be executed, like any animal that kills a person. <b>And an ox</b> belonging to <b>a person</b> who is <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that killed</b> an individual is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is as <b>the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned and its owner shall also be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29). Based on the juxtaposition between the owner and his ox it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we</b> can <b>read concerning</b> the situation: <b>“And its owner shall also be put to death,” we read,</b> i.e., apply, <b>concerning it: “The ox shall be stoned.” And anywhere that we cannot read concerning it: “And its owner shall also be put to death,” we do not read concerning it: “The ox shall be stoned.”</b> Since the owner of the ox cannot be executed, as he is a <i>tereifa</i>, his ox is also not liable to be stoned. |
| Exodus 21:30 | whatever is imposed upon him” | Bava Kamma26a:8 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to an ox killing a person: “He shall give for the redemption of his life <b>whatever is imposed upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:30). <b>“Upon him”:</b> This means upon the owner of an ox who kills a person, <b>but not upon a person</b> who kills another. |
| Exodus 21:30 | “He shall give for the redemption of his life” | Bava Kamma27a:2 | The Gemara discusses a similar scenario: If one threw a child from a roof and a forewarned <b>ox came</b> along <b>and impaled</b> the child <b>on its horns</b> and the child died, the question of whether or not the owner of the ox is liable to pay ransom is dependent upon <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael, son of</b> Rabbi <b>Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“He shall give for the redemption of his life”</b> (Exodus 21:30), indicates that he must pay <b>the value of the injured</b> party, i.e., the one who was killed. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> He must pay <b>the value of the one responsible for the damage.</b> Since the child that was thrown off the roof had no monetary value at the time he was gored by the ox, as it was as if he were already dead, the Rabbis would exempt the owner of the ox from paying ransom. According to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, the owner of the ox must pay his own value to the family of the victim. |
| Exodus 21:30 | later | Bava Kamma40a:10 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Imposing is stated</b> in the <b>later</b> verse: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposing is stated</b> in the <b>earlier</b> verse, concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him” (Exodus 21:22). This verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage, the evaluation is <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party<b>,</b> i.e., the fetus, <b>so too here,</b> the ransom is <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party. |
| Exodus 21:30 | then he shall give for the redemption of his life” | Bava Kamma40a:7 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “If a ransom is imposed upon him, <b>then he shall give for the redemption of his life”</b> (Exodus 21:30), is referring to the monetary <b>value of the injured</b> party. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The ransom corresponds to the monetary <b>value of the one liable for the damage.</b> |
| Exodus 21:30 | the verse states: “If a ransom | Bava Kamma43b:15 | § With regard to Rabba’s statement that for an ox that killed a person unintentionally one is exempt from paying ransom, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>“A ransom</b> is laid on him.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If a ransom</b> is laid on him” (Exodus 21:30)? It is <b>to include</b> liability to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case where the ox killed <b>unintentionally,</b> just <b>as</b> one is liable to pay <b>ransom</b> when it killed <b>intentionally,</b> in contrast to Rabba’s opinion. |
| Exodus 21:30 | and he shall give the redemption of his soul” | Makkot 2b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>atonement? Rav Ḥisda says: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse concerning a case where the ox of one person gored another: “If ransom is imposed upon him, <b>and he shall give the redemption of his soul”</b> (Exodus 21:30); the term “his soul” means <b>the value of the victim,</b> i.e., the owner of the ox must pay the heirs of the deceased his value as it would be assessed were he sold as a slave in the market. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The term “his soul” means <b>the value of the one liable for the damage. What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this</b> principle: <b>That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>monetary restitution</b> for the damage that his ox caused the victim; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>holds</b> that <b>the ransom</b> is <b>atonement,</b> as he thereby redeems his own soul from death at the hand of Heaven? |
| Exodus 21:30 | Imposition is stated below | Makkot 2b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who abandon the straightforward meaning of the verse? The Rabbis derive it in the following manner: <b>Imposition is stated below</b> with regard to one whose ox killed another: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposition is stated above,</b> in the case of one who struck a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman imposes upon him” (Exodus 21:22). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the miscarriage, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim,</b> the fetus, that we assess the payment, <b>here too,</b> in the case of the ransom, it is <b>in</b> terms of the value <b>of</b> the <b>victim</b> that we assess the payment. |
| Exodus 21:30 | the Merciful One states: “And he shall be sold for his theft” | Makkot 2b:15 | <b>Rava said to him: And let</b> the witnesses <b>say to</b> the person against whom they testified: <b>If you had</b> money, <b>would you have been sold? We too will not be sold.</b> Since they have the means, they can pay the sum that they owe and not be sold as slaves. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara proposes an alternative formulation of the statement of Rav Hamnuna. <b>Rav Hamnuna thought to say: This statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where either he,</b> the falsely accused, <b>or they,</b> the witnesses, <b>have</b> the means to pay the sum; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where neither he nor they have</b> the means, the witnesses <b>are sold.</b> In that case, had their testimony stood, the alleged thief would have been sold into slavery, and they too lack the means to pay the sum that they are liable to pay as conspiring witnesses. Therefore, they are sold. <b>Rava said to him:</b> That is not so, as <b>the Merciful One states: “And he shall be sold for his theft”</b> (Exodus 21:30), from which it is inferred: <b>For his theft, but not for his conspiring</b> testimony. |
| Exodus 21:30 | as it is written: “If a ransom be placed upon him, | Sanhedrin 15b:4 | The Gemara responds: It would <b>not enter your mind</b> to think this, <b>as it is written: “If a ransom be placed upon him,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is placed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, that verse would not be understood, for the following reason: <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer</b> who was convicted to die, for he shall be put to death” (Numbers 35:31)? Since in this case there is a ransom payment, it is clear that there is no actual death penalty involved. |
| Exodus 21:31 | according to this judgment shall it be done to him” | Bava Kamma33a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis about a case where an ox injures a person, <b>the Sages taught:</b> It is derived from the verse: “Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, <b>according to this judgment shall it be done to him”</b> (Exodus 21:31), that <b>as is the judgment</b> concerning <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to an ox, so is the judgment</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to a person. Just as</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to an ox,</b> if it is <b>innocuous</b> its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and</b> if it is <b>forewarned</b> he pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage, so too,</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to a person,</b> if it is an <b>innocuous</b> ox its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and</b> if it is a <b>forewarned</b> ox the owner pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> |
| Exodus 21:31 | the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [ lo ]” | Bava Kamma42b:8 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But didn’t Rabbi Akiva</b> already <b>break</b> the force of <b>his fist,</b> i.e., qualify this opinion of his? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the owner of an innocuous ox that injured a person <b>pays</b> compensation <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, the same as the owner of a forewarned ox. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:31), indicating that <b>he pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the ox <b>but he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, as the word <i>lo</i> also means: To it. This negates Rav Asi’s explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation. |
| Exodus 21:31 | “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter” | Bava Kamma43b:22 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in</b> a case where the ox killed <b>a boy or in</b> a case where it killed <b>a girl. The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter”</b> (Exodus 21:31), <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the death of <b>minors</b> just <b>as for adults.</b> |
| Exodus 21:31 | shall it be done to him” | Bava Kamma5a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Akiva break</b> the force of <b>his fist [<i>gezizeih</i>],</b> i.e., he significantly tempered the force of his statement, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>an innocuous ox that injured a person,</b> the owner of the ox <b>would pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property and not merely from the body of his animal, as in the case of an innocuous ox that damages property; therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to an ox that gores a person: “According to this judgment <b>shall it be done to him”</b> (Exodus 21:31), from which it is derived that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of the <b>body</b> of his ox, <b>and he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property. The mishna states that one pays restitution from his superior-quality property in instances of all primary categories of damage. Since in the case of an innocuous ox that injured a person even Rabbi Akiva concedes that the owner does not pay from his superior-quality property, it should not be included in a list of the primary categories. |
| Exodus 21:32 | thirty sela , | Arakhin 14b:19 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a forewarned ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> in the case of an ox <b>that killed the</b> most <b>attractive among the slaves,</b> whose value is great, <b>and</b> likewise in the case of one that killed <b>the</b> most <b>unsightly among the slaves,</b> whose value is minimal, its owner <b>gives</b> payment of <b>thirty <i>sela</i>,</b> the fine stated in the Torah (Exodus 21:32), to the owner of the slave. If the ox <b>killed a freeman,</b> its owner <b>gives his price</b> as payment to his heirs. This sum can be more or less than thirty shekels. If the ox <b>injured this</b> slave <b>or that</b> freeman, <b>he gives</b> payment of the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> as compensation. |
| Exodus 21:32 | thirty shekels, as it is stated: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned” | Bava Kamma43a:9 | § <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> With regard to <b>an ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave unintentionally,</b> the owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying the fine of <b>thirty shekels, as it is stated: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned”</b> (Exodus 21:32). It is derived from the verse that the liability to pay thirty shekels is dependent on the stoning of the ox; <b>whenever the ox is</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning, the owner pays thirty shekels</b> as compensation for the damage. If <b>the ox is not</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning,</b> e.g., if it killed unintentionally, <b>the owner does not pay thirty shekels.</b> |
| Exodus 21:32 | a slave” | Bava Kamma43b:16 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>If</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation <b>is so,</b> it should be implemented with regard to the fine for a Canaanite <b>slave as well,</b> and it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: The ox gores a slave or a maidservant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> the ox gores <b>a slave”</b> (Exodus 21:32)? It is <b>to include</b> liability in a case where the ox killed a Canaanite <b>slave unintentionally,</b> just <b>as</b> when it killed <b>a slave intentionally. And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but doesn’t Reish Lakish say</b> that for <b>an ox that killed a slave unintentionally</b> its owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying the <b>thirty shekels?</b> |
| Exodus 21:32 | “He shall give thirty shekels of silver to his master” | Gittin 42b:7 | The Gemara analyzes this question: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“He shall give thirty shekels of silver to his master”</b> (Exodus 21:32), <b>and this is not a master,</b> as in practice the slave has already been declared ownerless. <b>Or perhaps, since he is lacking a bill of manumission, he is</b> still <b>called a master.</b> |
| Exodus 21:32 | a slave, where it is written: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver” | Ketubot 42b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the verb “give” is explained in this manner, <b>with regard to</b> an ox that killed <b>a slave, where it is written: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver”</b> (Exodus 21:32), <b>so too</b> will you say that <b>the Torah entitled the master only from the time of giving?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>“Shall give [<i>yiten</i>],” is distinct,</b> and <b>“shall give [<i>venatan</i>],” is distinct.</b> The first expression, which is stated with regard to an ox that killed a slave, does not indicate that the recipient acquires the right to the money only from the moment it is given, whereas the formulation employed in the case of rape does indicate that this is the case. |
| Exodus 21:32 | for a slave, | Kiddushin 11b:7 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Asi <b>teaching us?</b> We have already <b>learned</b> all of these <i>halakhot</i> explicitly (<i>Bekhorot</i> 49b): The payment of <b>five <i>sela</i> for</b> the redemption of a firstborn <b>son</b> (Numbers 18:16); the payment of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for a slave,</b> paid by the owner of the ox that killed the slave (Exodus 21:32); the <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a rapist and by a seducer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29); the <b>one hundred</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a defamer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19); <b>all of these are</b> paid <b>in the sacred shekel,</b> which is <b>one hundred dinars in Tyrian</b> coinage. All of the cases in which a defined amount is mentioned by the Torah have already been taught, and it is unclear what Rav Asi adds. |
| Exodus 21:32 | slave | Kiddushin 17a:10 | The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that a freed slave is given <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> in total, <b>like the thirty</b> shekels of the fine that is paid <b>for a slave.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving,</b> as stated with regard to the severance gift, <b>from</b> the expression of <b>giving</b> stated in connection to a Canaanite <b>slave</b> gored by an ox: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver” (Exodus 21:32). <b>Just as there,</b> he must pay <b>thirty</b> shekels for the slave, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a severance gift, he must pay <b>thirty.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | the damage, as it is written | Bava Kamma19b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> the case in the mishna is one where the owner of the string concealed it and is exempt from liability, and Rav Huna means that the <b>owner of the chicken</b> is <b>liable.</b> Here too, the question arises: <b>What is different</b> in this case where one is <b>not</b> obligated to pay <b>the full</b> cost of <b>the damage, as it is written</b> (Exodus 21:33): <b>“If a man shall open a pit,</b> or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein,” he pays the damage, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written: If <b>an ox</b> shall open <b>a pit.</b> This indicates that if an ox opens a pit, the owner of the ox is exempt from liability. With regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage as well,</b> the owner should be exempt from liability, as it is written: “If <b>a man</b> shall open <b>a pit,” and</b> it is <b>not</b> written: If <b>an ox</b> shall open <b>a pit.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | with regard to all of them | Bava Kamma28b:2 | Rav Yehuda continued: <b>When I stated this</b> ruling of Rav <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: After all, we derive</b> the cases of damage caused by leaving <b>one’s stone, one’s knife, or one’s load</b> in the public domain <b>from</b> the case of <b>one’s pit, and I</b> therefore <b>read,</b> i.e., apply, <b>with regard to all of them</b> the inference of the Sages from the verse: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein” (Exodus 21:33), that the one who dug the pit is liable only if what incurred damage is <b>an ox, but not a person,</b> or <b>a donkey, but not vessels.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | and an ox or a donkey fall therein” | Bava Kamma28b:5 | <b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> discussing Pit: It is derived from the verse: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, <b>and an ox or a donkey fall therein”</b> (Exodus 21:33), that the digger is liable to pay restitution only if what incurred damage is <b>an ox but not a person,</b> or <b>a donkey but not vessels. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if <b>an ox with its equipment fell into</b> a pit, and the ox was wounded <b>and</b> the equipment <b>broke;</b> or if <b>a donkey with its equipment</b> fell in, and the donkey was wounded <b>and</b> the equipment <b>tore,</b> then the one who dug the pit is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution <b>for</b> any injury sustained by <b>the animal but exempt</b> from paying restitution <b>for the</b> damaged <b>equipment. To what</b> case <b>is this similar?</b> It is similar <b>to</b> the case of <b>his stone, or his knife, or his load that he left in the public domain, and they caused damage.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | does not cause death. | Bava Kamma3a:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>and the Sages have</b> an accepted <b>tradition</b> that a pit <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes</b> the <b>death</b> of an animal that falls into it, but a pit <b>nine</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes damage</b> to an animal that falls into it but <b>does not cause death.</b> Accordingly, the pit written in the Torah (Exodus 21:33), which mentions the death of the animal that fell therein, is ten handbreadths deep. This is classified as the primary category of Pit, and a pit nine handbreadths deep is its subcategory. |
| Exodus 21:33 | and not cover it” | Bava Kamma46a:3 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If that is so,</b> does <b>that which is written</b> with regard to a pit: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit <b>and not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), <b>also</b> mean that once a pit has been dug the owner <b>no longer has</b> any adequate way of <b>covering this</b> pit, which would exempt its owner from paying damages? |
| Exodus 21:33 | “And if a man shall open a pit” | Bava Kamma48a:12 | <b>Even though the Master says</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And if a man shall open a pit”</b> (Exodus 21:33), it limits the liability for the pit to a person who digs a pit, <b>but not an ox</b> that digs <b>a pit,</b> in which case the owner of the courtyard should be exempt, nevertheless, <b>here,</b> in Rava’s statement, <b>since this</b> owner of the courtyard <b>should have filled</b> the pit with earth <b>and</b> he <b>did not fill it,</b> he is considered <b>like someone who</b> actually <b>dug</b> the pit. |
| Exodus 21:33 | shall dig | Bava Kamma49b:17 | In explanation of this dispute, <b>Rabba says: With regard to a pit</b> that a person digs or opens <b>into the public domain, everyone agrees that he is liable</b> for damage that occurs as a result. <b>What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “And <b>if</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit,” <b>and</b> it also states: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <b>If</b> one is <b>liable for opening</b> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does the latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the interpretation of the verse must be that the responsibility for the pit <b>comes to him by engaging in opening</b> the pit <b>and by engaging in digging</b> the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard. <b>They disagree only</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | shall dig | Bava Kamma50a:5 | <b>When they disagree,</b> it is in a case <b>where the pit</b> was dug <b>in the public domain. Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that one is <b>also liable</b> for <b>a pit</b> dug <b>in the public domain, as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit,” and: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? <b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the responsibility for the pit <b>comes to him by engaging in opening</b> the pit <b>and by engaging in digging</b> the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard. |
| Exodus 21:33 | shall open | Bava Kamma50a:6 | <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases. This is because <b>these</b> phrases <b>are necessary, for if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically when <b>one opens</b> the covering of a pit that has already been dug <b>that it is sufficient for him to</b> place <b>a covering</b> on it to absolve himself of responsibility for damage it causes. This is the case where the Torah states: “And not cover it” (Exodus 21:33). But if one actually <b>digs</b> a pit, it <b>would not be sufficient</b> to place <b>a covering</b> on it, and one would not be exempt from damages <b>unless he</b> completely <b>packs it.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | a pit, | Bava Kamma50b:4 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who digs a pit in the public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the <b>same</b> for <b>one who digs</b> either <b>a pit; a ditch,</b> which is narrow and long; <b>or a cave,</b> which is rectangular and roofed; <b>trenches and</b> water <b>channels.</b> In all these cases he is <b>liable. If so, why is</b> the verse <b>stated</b> as referring to <b>a pit,</b> as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <b>just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths.</b> If any of the types of excavations <b>were less than ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>and an ox or a donkey fell into</b> one of <b>them and died,</b> the digger of the excavation is <b>exempt. But if it was injured in it,</b> not killed, he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. |
| Exodus 21:33 | fall | Bava Kamma50b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the source for <b>the reasoning of Rav,</b> that one is not liable in that case? The Gemara answers: <b>Since the verse states: “And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall</b> therein” (Exodus 21:33), indicating that there is no liability for damage by Pit <b>unless</b> the animal <b>falls</b> in the <b>normal manner of falling,</b> but not where it first climbed onto an elevated surface and then fell from there to the level ground. <b>And according to Shmuel,</b> the term: <b>“And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall,” indicates any manner</b> of falling, regardless of whether the animal fell into a hole or fell to the ground from an elevated surface. |
| Exodus 21:33 | a pit, | Bava Kamma50b:9 | The Gemara challenges Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If so, why is</b> the verse <b>stated</b> as referring to <b>a pit,</b> as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <b>just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths.</b> Now, <b>granted</b> that according <b>to Shmuel,</b> the term: <b>So too, any</b> other, serves <b>to include</b> the case where the animal fell from <b>a height</b> of ten handbreadths, in which case the one who fashioned the mound would also be liable. <b>But according to Rav,</b> who exempts him in that case, <b>what</b> does the term: <b>So too, any</b> other, <b>add?</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | shall dig | Bava Kamma51a:20 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? As the verse states: “If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit, <b>or if</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), it raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a covered pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does that latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> the case of one person who begins to <b>dig</b> a pit and <b>after</b> he does so, a second person continues to <b>dig.</b> By subsequently stating: “If a man shall dig a pit,” the Torah teaches <b>that</b> a new pit is effectively created by the second digger, whose digging <b>removed,</b> i.e., rendered irrelevant, <b>the action of the first</b> digger and who bears full responsibility for the pit. |
| Exodus 21:33 | fall | Bava Kamma53a:9 | <b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> The verse states with regard to damage caused by a pit to an animal: <b>“And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall</b> therein” (Exodus 21:33), which is interpreted to mean that one is not liable <b>unless</b> the animal <b>falls</b> in the usual <b>manner of falling. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if it <b>fell forward due to the sound of the digging,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> but if it fell <b>backward due to the sound of the digging,</b> he is <b>exempt, and</b> both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case refer to damage <b>by a pit.</b> |
| Exodus 21:33 | What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Since the verse states: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein” | Bava Kamma53b:14 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Since the verse states: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein”</b> (Exodus 21:33), it is inferred that it is specifically <b>an ox, but not a person,</b> for whose death the owner of the pit is liable. Moreover, one is liable for <b>a donkey, but not vessels.</b> By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> expounds the word <b>“or”</b> in the expression “an ox or a donkey” <b>to include vessels.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain the word “or”? |
| Exodus 21:33 | Pit? As it is written: “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, | Bava Kamma55b:11 | Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Pit? As it is written: “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it,</b> and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:33). One can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>he covered it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability, even though it is possible that the pit would become uncovered in the future. |
| Exodus 21:33 | and does not cover it” | Zevachim 66a:1 | It means that the priest <b>does not have to separate</b> it, but not that it is prohibited to do so. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to a pit</b> in the public domain, <b>where it is written:</b> “And if a man shall open a pit…<b>and does not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), can one claim that this verse <b>also</b> means <b>that he does not have to cover</b> it? |
| Exodus 21:34 | “He shall recompense” | Bava Kamma10b:26 | Rav Kahana questions the need for the Torah to teach this: <b>Now, if</b> the one liable for the damage <b>had</b> in his possession the carcasses of <b>several torn animals, he could give</b> the injured party a carcass as payment, <b>as the Master said</b> above (7a): The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid items with which to pay restitution. <b>Is it necessary</b> for the Torah to teach that he can pay restitution with <b>his,</b> i.e., the injured party’s, animal carcass? Granting ownership of the carcass to the injured party seems pointless, because even had the Torah granted it to the one liable for the damage, he could give it to the injured party as payment. |
| Exodus 21:34 | he shall restore money to its owner, and the carcass | Bava Kamma11a:4 | <b>And</b> so <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Others say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is</b> incumbent <b>upon the owner of the pit to raise the ox from his pit</b> after it was killed by falling into it? <b>The verse states:</b> “The owner of the pit shall pay; <b>he shall restore money to its owner, and the carcass</b> shall be his” (Exodus 21:34). They read the term “and the carcass” as a second subject of the term “he shall restore.” It therefore indicates that the one liable for the damage must restore the carcass to the injured party by retrieving it. The fact that this opinion is introduced with the phrase: Others say, suggests that it stands in opposition to another opinion. That other opinion apparently holds that the owner of the injured animal is responsible for retrieving the carcass. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “He shall recompense” | Bava Kamma14b:12 | <b>Rav Yehuda bar Ḥinnana raises a contradiction to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua:</b> In the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier <b>it is taught:</b> The mishna’s statement that payment is made with items <b>worth money teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>But it is taught</b> also in another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states the superfluous phrase: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, is accepted as a valid form of payment. The first <i>baraita</i> teaches that only land is a valid form of payment, whereas the second <i>baraita</i> teaches that one may pay even with movable property. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “And the carcass shall be for him” | Bava Kamma3a:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>and the Sages have</b> an accepted <b>tradition</b> that a pit <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes</b> the <b>death</b> of an animal that falls into it, but a pit <b>nine</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes damage</b> to an animal that falls into it but <b>does not cause death.</b> Accordingly, the pit written in the Torah (Exodus 21:33), which mentions the death of the animal that fell therein, is ten handbreadths deep. This is classified as the primary category of Pit, and a pit nine handbreadths deep is its subcategory. |
| Exodus 21:34 | as it is written: “The owner of the pit | Bava Kamma50a:1 | in the case <b>where</b> one dug <b>the pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then renounced ownership of the surrounding area. Consequently, the entire area except for the pit is now open to public passage. In this case, <b>Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> is <b>also liable,</b> not only when the pit is located in the public domain, <b>as it is written: “The owner of the pit</b> shall pay” (Exodus 21:34). Clearly, <b>the Merciful One is referring to a pit that has an owner.</b> Therefore, the owner of the pit pays even if it is located on private property. |
| Exodus 21:34 | of compensation | Bava Kamma50a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> according to Rabba’s explanation, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>This is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah,</b> in reference to digging a pit on one’s property, <b>that Rabbi Akiva states?</b> According to him, one is liable for damage in all cases, including digging in the public domain. The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of compensation</b> for damage caused. In that context, the Torah states: “The owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:34), indicating that even a pit owned on one’s private property renders one liable. |
| Exodus 21:34 | teaches us | Bava Kamma50a:7 | <b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig,” I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically in a case of <b>digging that a covering is required</b> to exempt one from liability, <b>because he performed an action</b> of creating the pit. <b>But</b> for merely <b>opening</b> it, <b>where one has not performed an action, say</b> that he <b>does not require a covering</b> to absolve him of liability. Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that he is liable for damage caused by a pit in both cases, and one should interpret the verse that states: “The owner of the pit” (Exodus 21:34), in its plain sense, i.e., that he is the owner of the pit because it is located on his private property. Accordingly, one would not be liable for a pit dug in the public domain. |
| Exodus 21:34 | since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him” | Bava Kamma51a:27 | The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to suggest this, <b>since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34). This indicates that it is <b>the one who causes the death,</b> i.e., the second one, who is liable, and not the first. This is because it is the second one who completed digging the necessary depth for causing death, and not the first. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “And the carcass shall be for him” | Bava Kamma53b:8 | Rava explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that the owner of the pit is exempt from liability for damage caused to a disqualified consecrated ox? Since <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a pit: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), it teaches that the obligation to pay damages is imposed only <b>on the one to whom the carcass</b> subsequently <b>belongs,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> case of a disqualified consecrated ox, <b>where the carcass does not belong to him.</b> In this case, it is prohibited to sell the carcass. The owner of the pit cannot derive benefit from it, and it no longer belongs to anyone, so the conditions written in the verse are not in effect. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “He shall recompense money to its owners” | Bava Kamma54a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of liability for Pit must be derived from another source. The <b>verse states</b> concerning Pit: <b>“He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), thereby <b>including any</b> item <b>that has an owner</b> within the scope of liability. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even vessels and people</b> should be included <b>as well,</b> which presents a difficulty for all opinions. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “The owner of the pit shall pay” | Bava Kamma54a:3 | The Sages <b>said</b> in response: The following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), means that <b>it then generalized</b> again. The verses are structured according to the principle of halakhic exegesis of: <b>A generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to this principle, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verses are referring <b>only</b> to items that are <b>similar to the detail.</b> In this case, <b>just as the explicit detail</b> is referring to <b>animals, so too, all</b> items included in the generalization must be <b>animals.</b> |
| Exodus 21:34 | verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him” | Bava Kamma54a:6 | The original difficulty therefore resurfaces: Why is the verse not expounded as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, thereby excluding birds? <b>Rather,</b> the previous method of deriving liability for a pit must be rejected, and instead it should be derived as follows: The <b>verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), from which it may be inferred that <b>anything subject to death</b> is included. |
| Exodus 21:34 | written: “He shall recompense money to its owners” | Bava Kamma54b:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the sources for all of the <i>halakhot</i> enumerated in the mishna that apply to all animals. <b>With regard to falling</b> into <b>a pit,</b> it is <b>written: “He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), which means that <b>any</b> animal <b>that has owners</b> is included, <b>as we mentioned</b> (see 54a). <b>With regard to</b> the requirement that animals keep their <b>distance</b> from <b>Mount Sinai</b> before the giving of the Torah, this is derived from the verse: <b>“Whether it be animal or person, it shall not live”</b> (Exodus 19:13), <b>and an undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] is</b> also <b>included in</b> the term <b>animal [<i>behema</i>].</b> In addition, the word <b>“whether”</b> serves <b>to include birds.</b> |
| Exodus 21:34 | “He shall recompense | Bava Kamma9a:7 | <b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense</b> money to its owner” (Exodus 21:34), which serves <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of payment. |
| Exodus 21:34 | “The owner of the pit shall pay” | Zevachim 66a:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a pit, <b>since it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), it is evident that <b>it is incumbent upon him to cover</b> the pit. <b>But here, since it is written</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), the term “it” indicates that the verse is referring only to a burnt offering, and <b>the verse has</b> thereby <b>differentiated between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering.</b> |
| Exodus 21:35 | “And divide its monetary value” | Bava Kamma26a:2 | The Gemara rejects this as well: This is also incorrect, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the payment of half the damages: <b>“And divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). The use of the expression “its monetary value,” and not “the monetary value,” emphasizes that it is specifically <b>the price of this</b> ox that caused damage classified as Goring whose money will be divided, i.e., the owner of the ox will be obligated to pay half the cost of the damage, <b>but not the price of another,</b> i.e., not in other cases of damage caused by one’s ox. |
| Exodus 21:35 | divide” | Bava Kamma26a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states</b> in reference to an innocuous ox: “And the carcass <b>they shall</b> also <b>divide”</b> (Exodus 21:35), to indicate that <b>there is no difference</b> with regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, whether</b> the damage occurs <b>in a public domain or</b> whether it occurs <b>on private property.</b> |
| Exodus 21:35 | hurts [ yiggof ] | Bava Kamma2b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>goring that it is characterized</b> as <b>a primary category</b> of damage, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly in the verse: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <b><i>negifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> be characterized as a primary category, <b>as it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>negifa</i></b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is</b> actually a reference to <b>goring, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <b>began</b> its description of the case <b>with</b> the term <b><i>negifa</i> and</b> it <b>concluded with</b> the term <b>goring to say to you</b> that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <b>This</b> action <b>is <i>negifa</i></b> and <b>this</b> same action <b>is goring.</b> |
| Exodus 21:35 | hurts [ yiggof ] | Bava Kamma2b:11 | The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <b>what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>a person that it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>an animal that it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? |
| Exodus 21:35 | this verse: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value” | Bava Kamma33a:21 | <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>this verse: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). <b>Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One is commanding the court</b> to evaluate the damages in this manner, <b>and Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One is commanding the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for damage</b> to split ownership of the live ox, without the involvement of the court. |
| Exodus 21:35 | live | Bava Kamma33b:17 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the Torah: “Then they shall sell the <b>live</b> ox” (Exodus 21:35). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the injured party receives a share of ownership if the belligerent ox is <b>alive. From where</b> do I derive that this applies even if the ox’s owner <b>slaughtered it? The verse states: “Then they shall sell</b> the live <b>ox,”</b> indicating that <b>in any case,</b> whatever the circumstances, the injured party is paid from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox. |
| Exodus 21:35 | it is stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value” | Bava Kamma34a:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth nothing, Rabbi Meir said:</b> It is <b>about this</b> type of case that <b>it is stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). |
| Exodus 21:35 | pays more than half the damage. But the Torah stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value” | Bava Kamma34b:10 | § With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that the two owners split the value of both the belligerent ox and the dead ox between them, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to Rava: If so, we find</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> when <b>an innocuous</b> ox gores an ox that is worth less than it, its owner <b>pays more than half the damage. But the Torah stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). |
| Exodus 21:35 | “And the carcass they shall also divide” | Bava Kamma34b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rabbi Yehuda derive this <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass they shall also divide”</b> (Exodus 21:35), from which Rabbi Meir derived it? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> already <b>derive from</b> this verse <b>that this</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox and <b>half the dead</b> ox? |
| Exodus 21:35 | the ox of another” | Bava Kamma37b:11 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored a consecrated ox, and</b> conversely, <b>a consecrated</b> ox <b>that gored a non-sacred ox,</b> i.e., an ox owned by a Jew, the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if one man’s ox hurts <b>the ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35). It is derived from the phrase “the ox of another” that one is liable only if it is a non-sacred ox, <b>but not</b> if it is <b>a consecrated ox,</b> which belongs to the Temple treasury, regardless of whether the latter was the ox that gored or the ox that was gored. |
| Exodus 21:35 | ox of another” | Bava Kamma6b:25 | <b>If we say</b> that <b>our ox,</b> i.e., an ox belonging to a Jew, <b>gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property, there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And if one man’s ox hurts the <b>ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35). This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies only if the ox hurt an ox belonging to another Jew, <b>but not</b> if it hurt <b>an ox that is consecrated</b> property. In the latter case no damages are collected. |
| Exodus 21:35 | ox of another” | Bava Kamma7a:3 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually,</b> we can explain that we are dealing here with a case <b>where our ox gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you</b> about this explanation, i.e., that <b>the Merciful One states: “</b>The <b>ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35), which indicates that liability is incurred only for damaging another person’s ox <b>but not</b> for <b>an ox consecrated</b> to the Temple, <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees with that interpretation and <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya.</b> |
| Exodus 21:35 | another’s ox” | Gittin 49a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from ordinary damage <b>to</b> damage involving the <b>consecrated</b> property? To which case does this refer? <b>If we say</b> that <b>our ox,</b> i.e., an ox belonging to a Jew, <b>gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property, there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And if one man’s ox hurts <b>another’s ox”</b> (Exodus 21:35). This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies only if the ox hurt an ox belonging to another Jew, <b>but not</b> if it hurt <b>an ox that is consecrated</b> property. In the latter case no damages are collected. |
| Exodus 21:36 | and the carcass shall be his” | Bava Kamma10b:17 | <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to a person’s ox that fatally gored another ox: “He shall pay an ox for the ox, <b>and the carcass shall be his”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning the carcass belongs <b>to the injured</b> party, the owner of the gored animal. |
| Exodus 21:36 | “And the carcass shall be his” | Bava Kamma10b:18 | <b>And similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the carcass shall be his”</b> (Exodus 21:36). The verse means the carcass belongs <b>to the injured</b> party. Do <b>you say</b> it belongs <b>to the injured</b> party? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> belongs <b>only to the one liable for the damage?</b> To this suggestion, <b>you should say: It could not have been that.</b> |
| Exodus 21:36 | Abaye said: | Bava Kamma23b:17 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> that an ox is deemed forewarned only if it gored on three separate days? <b>Abaye said:</b> It states in the verse: “Or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox from yesterday and the day before yesterday, and its owner has not secured it” (Exodus 21:36). This leads to the following inference: <b>“Yesterday”</b> indicates <b>one</b> day, <b>“from yesterday”</b> indicates <b>two</b> days, <b>“the day before yesterday”</b> indicates <b>three</b> days, <b>“and its owner has not secured it”;</b> here <b>we arrive at a fourth</b> incident of <b>goring,</b> for which the owner pays the full amount of damages. |
| Exodus 21:36 | it says: “He shall pay” | Bava Kamma34b:7 | Rather, <b>you</b> should <b>say: Where do we find</b> a case where <b>the one liable for damage gains</b> from the damage, comparable to this case, <b>where this</b> owner of the belligerent ox <b>gains,</b> receiving more than the value of his ox? Clearly there is no such case, as one who is liable for damage does not gain from it. <b>And</b> in addition, <b>it says: “He shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:36), indicating that <b>the owner</b> of the belligerent ox <b>pays, and the owner does not take</b> more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage. |
| Exodus 21:36 | “And the owner has not secured it” | Bava Kamma45b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if the ox is <b>innocuous</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous ox. <b>But</b> if the ox is <b>forewarned,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for damage, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse describing damage by a forewarned ox: <b>“And the owner has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), <b>and this</b> ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <b>was secured.</b> |
| Exodus 21:36 | has not secured it” | Bava Kamma46a:2 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife. Rabba said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a forewarned ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning that once it is rendered forewarned the owner <b>no longer has</b> any sufficient manner of <b>safeguarding this</b> animal, and the owner is responsible for all damage it causes. |
| Exodus 21:36 | “And the carcass shall be for him” | Bava Kamma53b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>owner attends to the animal carcass?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:36), stated <b>with regard to Ox.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>What did you see</b> to determine <b>that from</b> the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Ox, you derive</b> from it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the owner</b> of the dead ox <b>attends to the carcass,</b> and from the verse <b>“And the carcass belongs to him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, you derive from it</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only <b>the one to whom the carcass belongs</b> pays damages? Why can’t <b>I reverse</b> the derivations from each verse and say the opposite? |
| Exodus 21:36 | “And the owner has not secured it” | Bava Kamma55b:9 | The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if the ox is <b>innocuous</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous animal. But if the ox is <b>forewarned,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from payment of damages, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse describing the liability for damage caused by a forewarned animal: <b>“And the owner has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), <b>and this</b> ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <b>was secured. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> A forewarned ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife.</b> According to this mishna, only Rabbi Yehuda maintains that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to render exempt from liability the owner of an ox that is forewarned. |
| Exodus 21:36 | “money.” | Bava Kamma5a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this, i.e., from where is it derived? The Gemara explains: It <b>is derived</b> using a verbal analogy from the terms <b>“in place of,” “giving,” “he shall pay,”</b> and <b>“money.”</b> The term “in place of” is written with regard to a forewarned ox that gores (Exodus 21:36); “he shall give” is written with regard to an ox that kills a slave (Exodus 21:32); “he shall pay” is written with regard to the categories of damage of Eating and Trampling (Exodus 22:4); and “money” is written with regard to Pit (Exodus 21:34). The <i>halakha</i> that one must pay from his best-quality property is stated explicitly in each of those four verses. In each of the twenty-four categories listed by Rabbi Ḥiyya one of those four terms is written, so by means of a verbal analogy, the requirement to pay from one’s best-quality property applies to each of them. |
| Exodus 21:36 | “He shall pay an ox for an ox” | Bava Kamma84a:15 | The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the fact that one who injures another pays monetary restitution <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to injuries caused to people <b>from</b> the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to <b>an ox</b> that gored another ox. <b>It is written here: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to a forewarned ox that gored the ox of another: <b>“He shall pay an ox for an ox”</b> (Exodus 21:36). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse does not mean that the owner pays compensation with an actual ox, but rather pays <b>monetary restitution, so too here,</b> one who injures another pays <b>monetary restitution.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, | Bava Kamma62b:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The principle of double payment</b> applies <b>more broadly than the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment, as the principle of double payment applies both to</b> the theft of <b>something that is alive and to</b> the theft of <b>something that is not alive, but the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to</b> the theft of <b>an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it,</b> he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37). |
| Exodus 21:37 | But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment | Bava Kamma67b:5 | § The Gemara returns to the mishna, which teaches: <b>But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment</b> applies only to the theft of an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37). |
| Exodus 21:37 | or sell it” | Bava Kamma68a:22 | The two <i>amora’im</i> explain the reasons for their respective rulings. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> because <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the fourfold or fivefold payment: “And slaughter it <b>or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), <b>and he has sold it.</b> There <b>is no difference</b> if the sale occurs <b>before despair,</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> if it takes place <b>after despair. Rav Sheshet says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>his liability is</b> in effect only if he sells the animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair, when his action,</b> i.e., the sale, <b>is effective. But</b> if he sells it <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, when his action is not effective,</b> he <b>is not liable,</b> as <b>we require</b> that the sale be <b>similar to the slaughter,</b> as they are mentioned together, and <b>when</b> he slaughters the animal <b>his action is effective.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | “And slaughter it or sell it” | Bava Kamma68a:25 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a different <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). <b>Just as slaughter</b> is an act <b>that cannot be undone, so too</b> the <b>selling</b> referred to here is an act <b>that cannot be undone.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> did this sale take place? <b>If we say</b> that it happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his stolen item, <b>why can it not be undone?</b> The thief’s sale of the animal is invalid before the owner’s despair, and therefore the sale is easily undone. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a sale that took place <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And</b> one can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that there is <b>liability</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment only if the animal is sold <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. Rav Naḥman</b> rejected this proof, as he <b>interpreted</b> that <i>baraita</i> as serving to <b>exclude one who transferred</b> ownership of the animal temporarily, e.g., <b>for thirty days.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughter it or sell it” | Bava Kamma68a:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). <b>Just as slaughter</b> is an act <b>that cannot be undone, so too</b> the <b>selling</b> referred to here is an act <b>that cannot be undone.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it” | Bava Kamma71a:8 | The Gemara provides several reasons why in the case of fourfold or fivefold payment it is possible for the thief to be liable for another’s actions. <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), thereby juxtaposing the two acts of slaughtering and selling. It is derived that <b>just as</b> there is liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment through <b>selling,</b> which by definition is performed <b>by means of another</b> party, <b>so too,</b> there is liability for <b>slaughtering</b> when it is performed <b>by means of another</b> party. |
| Exodus 21:37 | five oxen | Bava Kamma71b:14 | The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “He shall pay <b>five oxen</b> for an ox” (Exodus 21:37), which indicates five full oxen, <b>but not five half-oxen. Or perhaps</b> when <b>the Merciful One states “five oxen,”</b> this means that <b>even five half-oxen</b> must be paid in a case of this kind. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>The Merciful One states: “Five oxen,”</b> which means five full oxen, <b>but not five half-oxen.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughter it” | Bava Kamma72a:3 | Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In <b>the first clause,</b> where the father’s animal was stolen and slaughtered in his lifetime, <b>I read about</b> this case the verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which indicates that the thief slaughtered the ox or the sheep <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner. In <b>the latter clause,</b> where the animal was slaughtered after the father’s death, <b>I do not read about</b> this case the verse: <b>“And slaughter it,”</b> which describes a slaughter that was performed <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner, because the animal already partially belonged to him, and his own portion of the ox was slaughtered in a permitted manner. |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughter it” | Bava Kamma72a:6 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi in response: It is possible to explain the mishna even if one maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s objection with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet. |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughter it” | Bava Kamma72b:2 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi: It is possible to explain the mishna even according to the opinion that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter, and even if one maintains that it is prohibited by Torah law to benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>as well?</b> It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s suggestion with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that in order to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet. |
| Exodus 21:37 | a sheep [ seh ]” | Bava Kamma77b:13 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment in the case of an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Gemara asks: It is <b>written</b> in the Torah: “If a man steals an ox or <b>a sheep [<i>seh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:37), <b>and Rava says,</b> concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this</b> verse <b>establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases: <b>Wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Hebrew word <i>seh</i> denotes either a sheep or a goat. A hybrid, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <i>seh</i>. Why, then, is the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable to one who stole this kind of animal? |
| Exodus 21:37 | as the verse states “or” | Bava Kamma77b:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the case of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as the verse states “or”</b> (Exodus 21:37), a term that could have been avoided, as explained earlier (67b). This extra word serves <b>to include</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., the sheep-goat hybrid. |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughters it or sells it” | Bava Kamma77b:3 | Reish Lakish could have <b>said to you</b> that the verse states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). This verse compares slaughtering to selling, thereby indicating that <b>anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of a particular animal <b>it is</b> likewise applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter, and anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of an animal <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter</b> either. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>since when one sells sacrificial</b> animals <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> and no fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred, so too, <b>there is no</b> fourfold or fivefold payment for their <b>slaughter.</b> |
| Exodus 21:37 | do they disagree? The first tanna holds | Bava Kamma78b:13 | The Gemara analyzes the four opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i> presented in these <i>baraitot</i>. <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that when the Torah states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), the term <b>“and slaughters it”</b> indicates that <b>we require</b> him to slaughter <b>all of it</b> for him to incur liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Likewise, the term <b>“or sells it”</b> teaches that <b>we require</b> him to sell <b>all of it,</b> not leaving any portion at all for himself, even the fleece. |
| Exodus 21:37 | “And slaughters it or sells it” | Bava Kamma79a:3 | <b>What</b> is <b>the reason</b> that this case is an exception to the principle? It is because the verse states: <b>“And slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which juxtaposes the two acts of slaughtering and selling. This teaches that <b>just as</b> one becomes liable for <b>selling, which</b> by definition <b>is impossible without another</b> party, i.e., the buyer, <b>so too one becomes liable</b> for <b>slaughtering</b> even when it is <b>by means of another</b> party, i.e., when the thief instructs another person to slaughter the animal on his behalf. |
| Exodus 21:37 | and four sheep [ tzon ] for a sheep” | Chullin 137a:20 | It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> that he <b>says in the name of his father:</b> The obligation of the first sheared wool applies to one who owns <b>four</b> sheep, since a verse calls four sheep <i>tzon</i>, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox, <b>and four sheep [<i>tzon</i>] for a sheep”</b> (Exodus 21:37). |
| Exodus 21:37 | but he does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment, | Gittin 55b:6 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> from what was learned in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 74a): If <b>one stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it, <b>and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he pays double payment</b> like a thief (see Exodus 22:3), <b>but he does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment,</b> as one must ordinarily pay when he slaughters or sells an ox or a sheep that he stole from another person (Exodus 21:37). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna: If one slaughtered an animal <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>in a case like this,</b> he is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i></b> for having sacrificed an offering outside the Temple. <b>And if you say</b> that the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering an item that was stolen from him <b>does not by itself</b> enable the thief to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item, <b>what is the relevance of</b> mentioning <b><i>karet</i>?</b> The punishment of <i>karet</i> should not apply, as the thief cannot consecrate an animal that does not belong to him. |
| Exodus 21:37 | and slaughter it or sell it” | Ketubot 33b:11 | The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation: <b>And does this</b> agent <b>sin and that</b> thief <b>is liable</b> to pay four and five times the principal? This violates the principle: There is no agent for matters of transgression. The Gemara explains that this is a <i>halakha</i> unique to this case. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “If a man steal an ox or a sheep <b>and slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). Based on the juxtaposition of slaughter and sale, Rava continues: <b>Just as sale</b> is performed <b>by means of another,</b> as there is no sale without a buyer, <b>so too,</b> one is liable to be punished for <b>slaughter by means of another.</b> Although there is no agent for transgression, here there is a Torah decree that one is liable by means of another. |
| Exodus 21:37 | slaughter or sale? The verse states: “And he slaughters it or sells it” | Kiddushin 43a:1 | <b>let us derive</b> a principle from misuse of consecrated property, that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression. The Gemara answers: This is not done, <b>because misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and</b> the <b>slaughter or sale</b> of a stolen cow or sheep <b>are two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara clarifies: The verse pertaining to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property is <b>that which we said,</b> but <b>what is</b> the verse with regard to <b>slaughter or sale? The verse states: “And he slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), juxtaposing selling to slaughtering: <b>Just as a sale</b> is necessarily performed <b>by means of another,</b> since every transaction involves two parties, <b>so too slaughter</b> can likewise be performed <b>by means of another,</b> and the thief is liable even if the act of slaughtering is performed by his agent. |
| Exodus 21:37 | to include an agent. The school of Ḥizkiyya taught: | Kiddushin 43a:2 | The Gemara quotes two other explanations. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the word <b>“or”</b> in the verse “and he slaughters it or sells it,” serves <b>to include an agent. The school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> When the verse states with regard to sale or slaughter: “He shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), repetition of the word <b>“for”</b> is superfluous and serves <b>to include an agent.</b> It teaches that the one who appointed the agent is liable for the action of the agent. |
| Exodus 22:1 | breaking in” | Sanhedrin 72b:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the words: “If a burglar is found <b>breaking in”</b> (Exodus 22:1), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a burglar who came <b>breaking in</b> through a wall. But <b>from where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies if he was found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his yard, or</b> in <b>the enclosed area</b> behind <b>his</b> house? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If <b>a burglar is found,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case. If</b> that is <b>so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Breaking in”? Because</b> the Torah speaks of a common case, and <b>most thieves are found breaking in.</b> |
| Exodus 22:1 | in…there shall not be blood shed on his account” | Sanhedrin 72b:3 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “If the sun is risen upon him, <b>there shall be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:2), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b> “If a burglar is found breaking <b>in…there shall not be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:1), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 22:1 | “If a thief be found breaking in | Yoma 85a:14 | <b>Rabbi Yishmael answered and said</b> that it is stated: <b>“If a thief be found breaking in</b> and be struck so that he dies, there shall be no blood-guiltiness for him” (Exodus 22:1). <b>Now, if this</b> is true for the thief, <b>where there is uncertainty whether he comes</b> to take <b>money</b> or to take <b>lives,</b> and it is known that <b>bloodshed renders the land impure,</b> since it is stated about a murderer: “And you shall not defile the land” (Numbers 35:34), <b>and it causes the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people,</b> as the verse continues: “In the midst of which I dwell, for I the Lord dwell in the midst of the children of Israel” (Numbers 35:34), and even so the home owner <b>is permitted to save himself at the cost of</b> the thief’s <b>life,</b> then <b><i>a fortiori</i> saving a life overrides Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 22:2 | for his theft” | Kiddushin 18a:8 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew maidservant is <b>not sold a second time.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>From the fact</b> that the <i>baraita</i> says this about a Hebrew maidservant, it can be inferred that <b>a Hebrew slave can be sold a second time. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “And he is sold <b>for his theft”</b> (Exodus 22:2), means that he can be sold to pay for the items that he has stolen <b>but not</b> to pay <b>for his double payment?</b> Although one can be sold into slavery to reimburse the owner for the principal of his theft, he cannot be sold to pay the fine. Furthermore, <b>“for his theft”</b> indicates: <b>But not</b> to pay <b>for his conspiring testimony.</b> If he is a conspiring witness, who is required to pay the value of what he testified that another had stolen but he does not have the money to do so, he is not sold as a slave. Additionally, the phrase <b>“for his theft”</b> teaches that he can be sold for stealing only once, and <b>once he has been sold one time you may not sell him again.</b> |
| Exodus 22:2 | said to him: Didn’t you say there, | Kiddushin 20b:9 | Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Didn’t you say there,</b> with regard to a thief who is sold to repay what he stole, that the verse: “And he is sold” (Exodus 22:2), teaches that <b>all of him is sold but not part of him?</b> If he is worth one thousand, and he owes five hundred for theft, he cannot be sold. <b>So too,</b> in the case of one who was sold to a gentile, the phrase <b>“he is redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:49) means <b>all of him and not part of him.</b> |
| Exodus 22:2 | there shall be blood shed on his account” | Sanhedrin 72b:3 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “If the sun is risen upon him, <b>there shall be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:2), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b> “If a burglar is found breaking <b>in…there shall not be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:1), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 22:2 | then he shall be sold for his theft” | Sotah 23b:12 | The mishna states: <b>A man is sold for his</b> committing an act of <b>theft, but a woman is not sold for her</b> committing an act of <b>theft.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states:</b> “If the sun rose upon him, there is blood-guilt for him; he shall make restitution; if he has nothing, <b>then he shall be sold for his theft”</b> (Exodus 22:2). The verse indicates that he is sold <b>for his theft, but</b> she is <b>not</b> sold <b>for her theft.</b> |
| Exodus 22:3 | He derives | Bava Kamma63b:20 | The Gemara responds: <b>He derives</b> the obligation of a thief to pay double payment without having taken an oath from a third verse: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The double payment in this verse applies to all items, as is derived <b>from what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught. As the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: Let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only <b>“ox” and “theft,” and all</b> items <b>would be included.</b> Why was it necessary to also mention “donkey” and “sheep”? |
| Exodus 22:3 | shall be found” | Bava Kamma64b:10 | § Until this point, the Gemara has been discussing the source of the obligation of a thief to pay double payment according to the <i>baraita</i> (63b) that maintains that both verses (Exodus 22:6–7) are referring to a bailee who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> of the two verses <b>is</b> speaking <b>about a thief and one</b> verse <b>is</b> speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole from him, <b>and he derives</b> that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“if the thief shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:6), <b>what does he derive from this</b> verse: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:3)? |
| Exodus 22:3 | alive, | Bava Kamma65a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., the source, for this ruling <b>of Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “If the <b>theft</b> shall be found in his possession <b>alive,</b> whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). <b>Why is the Merciful One saying “alive [<i>ḥayyim</i>]” in</b> the context of this <b>theft?</b> This juxtaposition serves to teach: When making payment, <b>revive [<i>aḥayah</i>] the principal</b> to the value it had <b>as</b> of the time <b>when he stole</b> it. |
| Exodus 22:3 | has returned to the owner. | Bava Kamma68b:15 | The Gemara asks a question with regard to Reish Lakish’s explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, that it is discussing a case where the owner of the animal consecrated it after it was stolen: <b>But the principal</b> amount, i.e., the stolen animal itself, <b>has returned to the owner.</b> By consecrating the animal, the owner has exercised his ownership of it, and it is therefore considered to have been returned to him at that point. The thief should therefore not be required to pay the double payment, as a thief is liable for double payment only when the stolen item is in his possession at the time of the trial, as it states: “The theft shall be found in his hand” (Exodus 22:3). |
| Exodus 22:3 | Rav? | Bava Kamma75a:6 | <b>Rava bar Ahilai said: What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rav?</b> With regard to theft, which is subject to a fine of double payment, the Torah states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The verb for “shall be found” is doubled, as the verse states “<i>himmatze timmatze</i>.” Rav derives from the repetition that there are two matters that are found: The double payment is imposed only <b>if it is found</b> [<i>himmatze</i>], i.e., it is revealed that he stole the item, <b>through</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> and the theft <b>is found</b> [<i>timmatze</i>], as determined <b>through judges.</b> This <b>excludes one who incriminates himself</b> through his own admission. |
| Exodus 22:3 | agency? But isn’t it taught | Bava Metzia10b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is there anyone who says</b> that <b>a courtyard is included</b> as a valid means of acquisition <b>due to</b> the option of acquiring property via <b>agency? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3)” From the term <b>“in his possession [<i>beyado</i>],” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case where the stolen item is found in <b>his hand [<i>yado</i>]. From where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies if it is found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his yard, or</b> in <b>his enclosure? The verse states</b> the repetitive phrase <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>],”</b> to indicate that the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case,</b> i.e., in any location that the stolen item is found. |
| Exodus 22:3 | is found in his hand” | Bava Metzia56b:5 | The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>anywhere that it is written “his hand”</b> the reference <b>is not</b> to <b>his actual hand? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>is found in his hand”</b> (Exodus 22:3): <b>I have</b> derived from here <b>only his hand; from where</b> do I derive that the <i>halakha</i> is the same if the stolen item is found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his courtyard, or</b> in <b>his enclosure? The verse states: “If</b> the theft <b>is found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>]”;</b> the use of the double verb teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case</b> where the stolen item is in his possession. |
| Exodus 22:3 | in his hand” | Gittin 77a:12 | <b>And that is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a thief.</b> It is written: “If the theft be found <b>in his hand”</b> (Exodus 22:3), from which <b>I have</b> derived that one is liable for theft <b>only</b> when the stolen item was found in <b>his hand.</b> But <b>from where</b> do I derive that one is liable for theft even if it was found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his courtyard, or</b> in <b>his enclosure,</b> i.e., if the item reached his domain and he secured it with the intent to steal it? <b>The verse states: “If</b> the theft <b>be found,”</b> indicating that he is liable <b>in any case,</b> whether it was found in his hand or in his domain. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “And it consumed in a field of another” | Bava Kamma14a:12 | <b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this</b> interpretation of Rav Yosef’s <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the courtyard is <b>designated for</b> both of them to keep their <b>produce</b> there, they should not be liable for damage caused by their oxen there, as in order for one to be liable <b>don’t we need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), <b>and</b> since they both have the right to use the courtyard it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “And it consumed in a field of another” | Bava Kamma14a:20 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by saying the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one? <b>If we say</b> the intention of the <i>baraita</i> is that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one <b>at all,</b> but <b>rather</b> it belongs <b>to another</b> person, why should either partner be liable? <b>But don’t I need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which is understood to mean that the consumed produce belongs to the owner of the field in which the act of consumption occurred; <b>and</b> since the injured party does not have any rights to this place it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition? |
| Exodus 22:4 | it is written: “And he set his animal loose” | Bava Kamma17b:3 | <b>And what is the reason</b> for the apparent redundancy in the mishna with regard to Eating? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> First the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Eating by an undomesticated animal and</b> then <b>he teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Eating by a domesticated animal.</b> And it was necessary to state both, as <b>it enters your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written: “And he set his animal loose”</b> (Exodus 22:4), with regard to <b>domesticated animals, yes,</b> the primary category of Eating applies, but with regard to <b>undomesticated animals, no,</b> the primary category of Eating does not apply. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that undomesticated animals</b> are included <b>in the category of domesticated animals</b> in this regard and the owner of an undomesticated animal is liable for damage caused by his animal eating another person’s produce. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “It consumed in the field of another” | Bava Kamma21b:5 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is possible to say <b>that everyone</b> agrees about the <i>halakha</i> in the case of an animal that <b>turns</b> its head, <b>either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. And here they disagree</b> about the exemption inferred from the verse: <b>“It consumed in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which renders the owner of an animal liable for damage classified as Eating. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that only if it ate from private property is its owner liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not</b> when it eats <b>in the public domain. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> it means that even if it ate from the public domain its owner is liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not</b> when it eats <b>in the domain of the one responsible for the damage;</b> only if the animal ate produce of another that was on the property of the animal’s owner, is its owner exempt. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “And it consumed in the field of another” | Bava Kamma23a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where did it eat</b> the cake? <b>If we say that it ate it</b> after placing it <b>on a stack</b> of grain <b>belonging to another,</b> i.e., someone other than the owner of the cake, then he should not be liable for the damage to the cake under the <i>halakhot</i> of Eating, <b>as</b> in order to hold someone liable <b>we require</b> fulfillment of scenario described in the verse: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), meaning that an act of damage classified as Eating must be caused on the property of the injured party, <b>and that is not</b> the case in this instance. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> only in the case <b>where</b> the dog <b>ate</b> the cake after placing it <b>on a stack</b> of grain owned <b>by the owner of the cake,</b> and that is why the dog’s owner is liable, as it ate it while on the property of the injured party. |
| Exodus 22:4 | The verse states | Bava Kamma25b:15 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Eating or Trampling (Exodus 22:4): <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,”</b> meaning that one’s liability for this form of damage is limited to damage caused on the property of the injured party, but <b>not</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain.</b> |
| Exodus 22:4 | he shall pay” | Bava Kamma26a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Eating and Trampling: “The best of his field and the best of his vineyard <b>he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). The intent of the verse is to emphasize that the owner of the ox pays <b>a proper,</b> meaning complete, amount of <b>payment,</b> and not half the cost of the damage. |
| Exodus 22:4 | as the Sages taught | Bava Kamma2b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>Where are Eating and Trampling written</b> in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <b>“And he sends forth,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling,</b> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <b>and likewise it states:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “And it consumed” | Bava Kamma3a:7 | <b>The Master said</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“And it consumed”</b> (Exodus 22:4), <b>this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating. And likewise it states:</b> “And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <b>as one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10). The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the phrase “and it consumed” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Eating is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “As one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone.”</b> The Gemara asks: Were <b>it not for this</b> verse, <b>with regard to what</b> case <b>would you have interpreted</b> that phrase? |
| Exodus 22:4 | and it feed [ uvi’er ] in the field of another” | Bava Kamma55b:13 | Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Eating? As it is written:</b> “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he set his animal loose, <b>and it feed [<i>uvi’er</i>] in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner does not bear liability <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to causing his animal to <b>feed</b> there, by being negligent. |
| Exodus 22:4 | loose [ veshilaḥ ], | Bava Kamma55b:14 | Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Trampling? As it is written:</b> “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, <b>and he set</b> his animal <b>loose [<i>veshilaḥ</i>],</b> and it feed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner is not liable <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to <b>setting</b> his animal <b>loose.</b> |
| Exodus 22:4 | Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “And it feed in another field [ uvi’er bisde aḥer ]” | Bava Kamma58b:3 | <b>Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “And it feed in another field [<i>uvi’er bisde aḥer</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:4). This <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to another field,</b> i.e., relative to the damaged field as a whole and not an appraisal of only the specific garden bed that was damaged. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay” | Bava Kamma59a:6 | The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which means he must pay according to the <b>best</b>-quality <b>field of the injured</b> party <b>or the best</b>-quality <b>vineyard of the injured</b> party. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: The verse comes only</b> to allow <b>injured</b> parties <b>to collect</b> compensation <b>from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land of the one liable to pay for the damage, <b>and</b> by an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference it is derived that this applies <b>to consecrated</b> property. Compensation for damaging consecrated property is paid from one’s best-quality assets. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “And it feed in another’s field” | Bava Kamma59b:5 | § The mishna (55b) teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the animal <b>ate ripe produce,</b> the owner pays the value of the ripe produce eaten. <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion? <b>This that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And it feed in another’s field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to</b> another <b>field, this statement</b> applies specifically with regard to <b>produce</b> that <b>requires a field</b> to grow. For one’s animal eating this <b>produce, which do not require the field</b> in order to ripen further, the animal’s owner <b>must pay</b> their value <b>as they are.</b> |
| Exodus 22:4 | “Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay” | Bava Kamma6b:12 | § The mishna continues: The owner or generator of the component that caused damage is obligated <b>to pay</b> restitution for damage with best-quality land. The one liable for the damage is indebted <b>to pay payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage</b> with his superior-quality land. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to paying damages: <b>“Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). What is the meaning of “his field” and “his vineyard”? It refers to that property of the injured party; the one liable for the damage pays from land of a quality that is commensurate to <b>the best</b>-quality <b>field of</b> the <b>injured</b> party <b>and</b> to <b>the best</b>-quality <b>vineyard of</b> the <b>injured</b> party, even if the property he damaged was of a lesser quality; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Exodus 22:4 | “field” is stated below, | Bava Kamma6b:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The word <b>“field” is stated below,</b> toward the end of the verse: “Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay” (Exodus 22:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“field” is</b> also <b>stated above,</b> at the beginning of that same verse: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another.” <b>Just as</b> the <b>field which is stated above</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party, <b>so too the field stated below</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party. |
| Exodus 22:4 | to Rava: It is written: “The best of his field and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay” | Bava Kamma7a:10 | § The Gemara considers others issues concerning the form in which restitution should be paid: <b>Abaye raises a contradiction</b> and addresses it <b>to Rava: It is written: “The best of his field and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which indicates that from his <b>best</b>-quality land, <b>yes,</b> he shall pay, but from <b>something else, no,</b> he shall not pay. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay” | Bava Kamma7a:9 | <b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say:</b> It is <b>taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), teaches that the appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the injured</b> party. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the one liable for the damage, and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the one liable for the damage.</b> This clearly indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva compensation is collected from the superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage. |
| Exodus 22:4 | the Merciful One states: “The best of his field” | Bava Kamma7b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the answer to the dilemma? When <b>the Merciful One states: “The best of his field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), does the stress in the verse on “his field” serve <b>to exclude</b> only the possibility of appraising land based solely on the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, but land is appraised based on the quality of land in the world at large? <b>Or perhaps,</b> does it serve <b>to exclude</b> the possibility of appraising land based on the quality of land <b>of the world</b> at large <b>as well,</b> and it is sufficient if the land he pays with is his best-quality land? |
| Exodus 22:4 | “Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay” | Gittin 48b:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> When the mishna says: For the betterment of the world, it seems to be referring to all of the cases in the mishna. The Gemara therefore asks: The first clause of the mishna states that compensation for damage is collected from superior-quality land. Is this ordinance also only <b>for the betterment of the world?</b> This <b>is by Torah law, as it is written</b> with regard to one who damages another person’s property: <b>“Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). |
| Exodus 22:4 | “field” is stated below, | Gittin 49a:2 | <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The word <b>“field” is stated below,</b> toward the end of the verse: “Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay” (Exodus 22:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“field” is</b> also <b>stated above,</b> at the beginning of that same verse: “If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field.” <b>Just as</b> the <b>field which is stated above</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party, <b>so too, the field stated below</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party. |
| Exodus 22:4 | “Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay” | Gittin 49b:1 | It is <b>taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), teaches that the appraisal is of <b>the best of the fields of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyards of the injured</b> party. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The appraisal is of <b>the best of the fields of the one who caused the damage, and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyards of the one who caused the damage.</b> This clearly indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva compensation is collected from the superior-quality land belonging to the one who caused the damage. |
| Exodus 22:4 | rely on what is written in the Torah: “Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay” | Gittin 49b:3 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 12:2) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the court <b>appraises land of superior quality for payment to injured</b> parties? It is <b>due to the robbers and due to those who take</b> that which is not theirs <b>by force [<i>ḥamsanin</i>].</b> How so? <b>So that a person will say: Why should I rob and why should I take by force? Tomorrow the court will come down to my property and take my finest field</b> in order to compensate the victim for what I have robbed or taken by force. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>rely on what is written in the Torah: “Of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). <b>Consequently, they said</b> that the court <b>appraises land of superior quality for payment to injured</b> parties. |
| Exodus 22:5 | as it is written: “If fire breaks out” | Bava Kamma22b:10 | <b>Rava said: A verse and a <i>baraita</i></b> both <b>support Rabbi Yoḥanan’s</b> opinion. The <b>verse</b> supporting his opinion is <b>as it is written: “If fire breaks out”</b> (Exodus 22:5), indicating that the fire <b>breaks out on its own;</b> yet the verse continues, <b>“the one who ignited the fire shall pay,”</b> indicating that the fire was ignited by a person. <b>Conclude from</b> the verse that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to damage caused by <b>his arrows,</b> as the resolution of the apparent inconsistency in the verse is that it relates to the individual as if he had himself started the blaze, and that is why he is obligated to pay for the damage. |
| Exodus 22:5 | Fire? As it is written: “The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation” | Bava Kamma55b:12 | Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Fire? As it is written: “The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), which is interpreted to mean that one is exempt from liability <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to actively <b>kindling</b> the fire in another’s property by being negligent. |
| Exodus 22:5 | “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, | Bava Kamma60a:16 | § The Gemara cites an aggadic midrash based on this verse: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Calamity befalls the world only when wicked</b> people are <b>in the world, but</b> the calamity <b>begins only with the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns,</b> so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed” (Exodus 22:5). <b>When does the fire,</b> i.e., calamity, <b>emerge?</b> At a time <b>when the thorns,</b> i.e., the wicked, <b>are found with it. But</b> calamity <b>begins only from the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And a stack of grain is consumed [<i>vene’ekhal</i>].” It is not stated:</b> If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, <b>and consumes [<i>ve’akhal</i>] the stack of grain; rather,</b> it states: <b>“A stack of grain is consumed,”</b> meaning <b>that</b> the <b>stack,</b> i.e., the righteous, <b>has already been consumed</b> before the thorns. |
| Exodus 22:5 | liable, as it is stated: “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed, the one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation” | Bava Kamma60a:8 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>sends</b> forth <b>a fire,</b> i.e., allows it to escape, <b>and it consumes wood, or stones, or earth,</b> he is <b>liable, as it is stated: “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed, the one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), which teaches that he is liable also for destroying the field itself. |
| Exodus 22:5 | “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns” | Bava Kamma60b:13 | Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa continued and <b>said to them: If so, I will say to you a matter that is appropriate to both of you,</b> which contains both <i>halakha</i> and <i>aggada</i>. In the verse that states: <b>“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns”</b> (Exodus 22:5), the term <b>“breaks out”</b> indicates that it breaks out <b>by itself.</b> Yet, the continuation of the verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation,”</b> which indicates that he must pay only if the fire spread due to his negligence. The verse can be explained allegorically: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> that although the fire broke out in the Temple due to the sins of the Jewish people, <b>it is incumbent upon Me to pay</b> restitution <b>for the fire that I kindled.</b> |
| Exodus 22:5 | “The one who kindled the fire shall pay [ shallem yeshallem ] compensation” | Bava Kamma61b:2 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who kindles</b> a fire <b>on his own</b> premises, <b>up to what</b> distance <b>may the fire travel</b> within his property for him to still bear liability for damage caused? <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says:</b> The court <b>views his</b> location where he kindled the fire <b>as if it were in the center of a <i>beit kor</i>.</b> Therefore, if the fire spreads and causes damage farther away than half a <i>beit kor</i>, the one who kindled the fire is exempt, since he could not anticipate that the fire would spread so far. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>sixteen cubits, like</b> the width of <b>a public thoroughfare. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>fifty cubits. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay [<i>shallem yeshallem</i>] compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), to teach that <b>everything is according to the fire.</b> |
| Exodus 22:6 | “If a man gives | Bava Kamma106b:17 | <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“If a man gives</b> his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard, and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The use of the word “man” indicates that the <b>giving</b> of a deposit <b>by a minor is nothing. And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case <b>where he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is</b> still a <b>minor. From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> would be the same in a case where <b>he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., the claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> both done when he is an adult. |
| Exodus 22:6 | “If the thief shall be found, | Bava Kamma106b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to a thief and one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit. According to him, there is a juxtaposition, and one can <b>well</b> derive one from the other. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>both this</b> verse: <b>“If the thief shall be found,</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <b>and: “If the thief shall not be found”</b> (Exodus 22:7), are referring to one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, and neither verse is referring to a thief, <b>what is there to say?</b> |
| Exodus 22:6 | as it is written: | Bava Kamma63a:9 | <b>After all,</b> there is another <b>generalization, and a detail, and a generalization written at the beginning</b> of this passage, <b>as it is written:</b> “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <b>“If a man gives his neighbor”</b> is <b>a generalization. “Money or vessels” is a detail.</b> When the verse concludes <b>“to safeguard,” it has generalized again.</b> |
| Exodus 22:6 | if the thief shall be found | Bava Kamma63b:5 | <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, <b>if the thief shall be found</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole. |
| Exodus 22:6 | “If the thief shall be found | Bava Kamma63b:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah states: <b>“If the thief shall be found</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <b>the verse is speaking of the thief himself.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is speaking <b>about the thief himself, or is it</b> speaking <b>only about one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole? If so, then <b>when</b> the verse then <b>says: “If the thief shall not be found</b>…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:7–8), the case of <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>is</b> already <b>stated. How,</b> then, <b>do I realize</b> the first verse about paying double: <b>“If the thief shall be found,”</b> so that it not be superfluous? It must be that <b>the</b> first <b>verse is speaking of the thief himself.</b> |
| Exodus 22:6 | “if the thief shall be found” | Bava Kamma64b:10 | § Until this point, the Gemara has been discussing the source of the obligation of a thief to pay double payment according to the <i>baraita</i> (63b) that maintains that both verses (Exodus 22:6–7) are referring to a bailee who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> of the two verses <b>is</b> speaking <b>about a thief and one</b> verse <b>is</b> speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole from him, <b>and he derives</b> that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“if the thief shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:6), <b>what does he derive from this</b> verse: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:3)? |
| Exodus 22:6 | a thief from there, | Bava Kamma64b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about a thief</b> himself <b>and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of double payment for <b>a thief from there,</b> i.e., from the verse “if the thief shall be found” (Exodus 22:6), there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> the phrase <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> is required <b>for</b> teaching the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Rava bar Ahilai. But why do I</b> need <b>all these details,</b> “ox,” “donkey,” “sheep,” and “alive”? All the items excluded from double payment, such as land and slaves, are already derived from a different source. |
| Exodus 22:6 | “And it was stolen from the house of the man; | Bava Kamma69b:7 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found a different unattributed</b> mishna, which contradicts the opinion of the pious ones. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna here (62b): <b>One who steals</b> an item <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the thief or to the prior owner. <b>Why</b> not? <b>Granted</b> that <b>he does not pay to the first thief, as</b> the verse states: <b>“And it was stolen from the house of the man;</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), which indicates that the double payment applies in the case of an item “stolen from the house of the man,” i.e., from the owner’s jurisdiction, but <b>not</b> to an item stolen from <b>the thief’s house. But let him pay</b> the double payment <b>to the owner,</b> as it presumably still belonged to the owner when the second thief stole it. |
| Exodus 22:6 | and it was stolen from the house of the man, | Bava Kamma76a:15 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this last ruling? The reason is as it is written: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard <b>and it was stolen from the house of the man,</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The phrase “from the house of the man” indicates that a thief is obligated to pay the double payment only when they are stolen from a person, <b>but not</b> if the item in question was stolen <b>out of</b> the <b>house of the Temple</b> treasury. |
| Exodus 22:6 | raises a contradiction | Bava Kamma93a:14 | § The mishna teaches that if one instructed another: <b>Break my jug,</b> or: <b>Tear my garment,</b> and the other did so, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verses state with regard to bailees: “If a man delivers to his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard” (Exodus 22:6), and: “If a man delivers to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to safeguard” (Exodus 22:9). The Sages derived from these verses that the bailee is liable if the item was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to destroy;</b> if it was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to tear;</b> if it was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to distribute to the poor.</b> This indicates that a bailee is not liable for damage to an item if he was told to tear it, even if the owner did not state that it is on condition to be exempt. |
| Exodus 22:6 | “And it be stolen from the man’s house” | Bekhorot 11a:16 | <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we compare it to consecrated</b> property, then why must the thief pay double the principal? Doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state</b> with regard to the double payment of a thief: <b>“And it be stolen from the man’s house”</b> (Exodus 22:6), indicating: <b>But not</b> when it is stolen <b>from the Temple treasury?</b> In such a case the thief does not pay double. Evidently, a firstborn donkey does not have the status of consecrated property, and if another person redeemed it, it still belongs to the owner. The Gemara concludes: <b>And nothing more</b> remains to be said about this issue, as this is a clear proof. |
| Exodus 22:6 | it is written: “If a man deliver to his neighbor money or vessels to guard | Kiddushin 11b:1 | <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a claim that</b> someone has not returned a deposit or loan, when the defendant admits that only part of the claim is true, <b>it is written: “If a man deliver to his neighbor money or vessels to guard</b> and it be stolen out of the man’s house” (Exodus 22:6). The following verses teach that if the thief is not found, the case is brought to a court, where the defendant must take an oath. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to one who admits to part of a claim (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b): <b>The oath</b> administered <b>by the judges</b> to one who admits to part of a claim is administered only when <b>the claim</b> is for at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>, <b>and the</b> defendant’s <b>admission</b> is to at least <b>the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If every sum of money mentioned in the Torah is referring to Tyrian coinage, how did the Sages arrive at the amount of two <i>ma’a</i> in this case? |
| Exodus 22:6 | “If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard” | Shevuot 39b:10 | <b>And the verses are</b> precise <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as it is written</b> with regard to the case where an oath is administered due to admission to part of a claim: <b>“If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard”</b> (Exodus 22:6). It is derived from the juxtaposition of silver and vessels that <b>just as “vessels,”</b> in the plural, is referring to at least <b>two, so too, “silver”</b> is referring to at least <b>two</b> <i>ma’a</i> of silver. It is derived further that <b>just as silver is an item of substantial value, so too, any item of substantial value</b> is included. <b>And the Merciful One states</b> in the subsequent verses that an oath is administered in a case “where one says: <b>This is it”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., where the defendant admits to only part of the claim of “silver or vessels” and denies the rest of the claim. Evidently, the denial can be for an amount less than two silver <i>ma’a</i>. |
| Exodus 22:6 | the verse states: “If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard” | Shevuot 42a:12 | § The mishna teaches: <b>One does not take an oath concerning the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, and</b> the court <b>does not administer an oath to a minor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers that in the passage from which the <i>halakhot</i> of admission to part of a claim are derived, <b>the verse states: “If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard”</b> (Exodus 22:6). The word “man” indicates that the reference is only to adults, and <b>delivery by a minor is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not recognized as a halakhically significant act, as a minor is not halakhically competent. |
| Exodus 22:7 | and: “If the thief shall not be found” | Bava Kamma106b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to a thief and one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit. According to him, there is a juxtaposition, and one can <b>well</b> derive one from the other. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>both this</b> verse: <b>“If the thief shall be found,</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <b>and: “If the thief shall not be found”</b> (Exodus 22:7), are referring to one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, and neither verse is referring to a thief, <b>what is there to say?</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | the owner of the house shall approach the judges to determine if he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” | Bava Kamma107b:4 | § <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> With regard to an unpaid bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <b>he is not liable</b> to pay double payment <b>unless he misappropriates it,</b> i.e., uses it for his own needs, before taking his oath. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The verse states: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the owner of the house shall approach the judges to determine if he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and the following verse concludes: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor.” <b>By inference,</b> one can learn <b>that if he misappropriated it, he is liable</b> for double payment; <b>that is to say that we are dealing</b> only <b>with</b> a case <b>where he misappropriates it.</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | the owner of the house shall approach the judges if he has not misappropriated | Bava Kamma107b:9 | The Gemara cites an <i>amora</i> who disputes the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> With regard to an unpaid bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <b>once he misappropriated it</b> before he took an oath he is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>This is</b> what <b>the Merciful One is saying,</b> i.e., this is how the verse is to be understood: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the owner of the house shall approach the judges if he has not misappropriated</b> his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7), indicating that this verse speaks specifically with regard to a case where he did not misappropriate the deposit; <b>consequently,</b> if <b>he misappropriated it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from double payment. |
| Exodus 22:7 | the homeowner shall approach the judges | Bava Kamma63b:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the homeowner shall approach the judges</b> to determine if he laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This means that he shall come to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath.</b> Do <b>you say</b> he comes to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath, or is it only for</b> the purpose of facing <b>judgment?</b> The meaning may be determined by means of a verbal analogy. <b>Laying</b> the <b>hand [<i>shliḥut yad</i>],</b> referring to misappropriation, <b>is stated later,</b> in the verse: “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>and laying the hand is stated above,</b> i.e., Exodus 22:7. <b>Just as laying</b> the <b>hand later</b> is referring explicitly <b>to an oath, so too</b> laying the hand <b>here</b> is referring <b>to an oath.</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | “And the master of the house shall approach the judges | Bava Metzia41b:8 | <b>And the other</b> mention is <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And the master of the house shall approach the judges</b> to determine whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This is stated with regard <b>to an oath.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is stated with regard <b>to an oath, or</b> is it stated <b>only</b> with regard <b>to judgment? Misappropriation is stated below,</b> in a later verse in the chapter: “Whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>and misappropriation is stated above,</b> in an earlier verse in the chapter: “Whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). <b>Just as below</b> it is stated explicitly with regard <b>to an oath:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both to determine whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>so too here,</b> it is stated with regard <b>to an oath</b> and not merely for judgment. |
| Exodus 22:7 | “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” | Bava Metzia43b:13 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who intends to misappropriate a deposit</b> and voices that intent in the presence of witnesses, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay for any damage to the deposit from that point forward, <b>and Beit Hillel say:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>only</b> if <b>he</b> actually <b>misappropriates</b> the deposit, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning a bailee: <b>“Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7). If <b>he tilted the</b> deposited <b>barrel and took from it a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of wine for his own use, <b>and</b> the barrel <b>broke,</b> then <b>he pays only</b> for that <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i><b>.</b> If <b>he lifted</b> the barrel <b>and took from it a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of wine, <b>and</b> the barrel <b>broke,</b> since he acquired the barrel by lifting it, <b>he pays the value of</b> the <b>entire</b> barrel. |
| Exodus 22:7 | as it is stated: “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” | Bava Metzia44a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that one is liable to pay for intent to misappropriate a deposit? It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> It is written with regard to misappropriation: <b>“For every matter of [<i>devar</i>] trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The term <i>devar</i>, literally, word, <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is liable</b> to pay <b>for a thought</b> of misappropriation just <b>as</b> he is for <b>an action.</b> One pays for a matter of trespass even if there is no actual trespass. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He is liable</b> to pay <b>only</b> if <b>he</b> actually <b>misappropriates</b> the deposit, <b>as it is stated: “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7). <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: But isn’t it already stated: “For every matter of trespass”? Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: But isn’t it already stated: “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”?</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | is stated: “Whether he has not put his hand | Kiddushin 42b:11 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah uses the inclusive term “every” with regard to one suspected of misappropriating a deposit: <b>“For every matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> This inclusive term “every” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> speech and <b>thought,</b> i.e., intent to misappropriate, <b>like action. And Beit Hillel say: One is liable only if he</b> actually <b>misappropriates it, as</b> it <b>is stated: “Whether he has not put his hand</b> unto his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). |
| Exodus 22:7 | “The owner of the house shall come near the court [ ha’elohim ], | Sanhedrin 2b:5 | The Gemara explains this assertion. With regard to cases of <b>robbery, as it is written</b> with regard to a bailee who accepted a deposit from another and then claims that it was stolen: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near the court [<i>ha’elohim</i>],</b> to see whether he has not put his hand upon his neighbor’s property” (Exodus 22:7). And with regard to cases of personal <b>injury,</b> they are adjudicated in the same manner as cases of robbery, because <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if another <b>injured one’s body</b> and <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if another <b>injured one’s property?</b> Therefore, in order to clarify that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to cases of robbery and injury, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: What are these</b> cases of <b>monetary law?</b> Cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury. But</b> this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply with regard to cases of <b>admissions and loans.</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | “The owner of the house shall come near to the court” | Sanhedrin 3b:16 | <b>Rather, the Merciful One states: “Gather Me seventy men</b> of the Elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16), and this means that <b>from the time of gathering,</b> there must be <b>seventy.</b> Likewise, the verse states: <b>“And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall save”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25), from which it is derived that cases of capital law are adjudicated by twenty-three judges, and this <b>also</b> means that <b>from the time that the congregation judges</b> there must be twenty-three. <b>Similarly,</b> with regard to a case of monetary law, the verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near to the court”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and this means <b>from the time of coming near</b> to judge the cases there must be <b>three</b> judges. Consequently, there is no requirement that the verdict be decided by a majority who could themselves form a court. |
| Exodus 22:7 | “The owner of the house shall come near the court, | Sanhedrin 3b:2 | § The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the fundamental requirement for <b>three</b> judges? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“The owner of the house shall come near the court,</b> to see whether he has not put his hand upon his neighbor’s property” (Exodus 22:7), so <b>there is one</b> judge <b>here.</b> The following verse states: <b>“The cause of both parties shall come before the court,”</b> so <b>there are two</b> judges <b>here.</b> And that verse concludes: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn</b> shall pay double to his neighbor,” so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here,</b> corresponding to the three mentions of the term “the court.” This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> |
| Exodus 22:7 | as it is written: “Then the master of the house shall come near the judges [ ha’elohim ]” | Sanhedrin 56b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the source for the exposition: <b>“God [<i>Elohim</i>],” this</b> alludes to courts of <b>judgment,</b> is clear; <b>as it is written: “Then the master of the house shall come near the judges [<i>ha’elohim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:7). Evidently, judges are called <i>elohim</i>. <b>But</b> with regard to the exposition: <b>“And…commanded,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship, from where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | for any lost item about which one shall say: | Bava Kamma106b:16 | § The Gemara cites a related ruling: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a lost item,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, i.e., he found a lost item, and when the owner requested its return, he claimed that it had been stolen from him, and it became known that he lied and had taken the item himself, <b>he pays double payment. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written</b> in the verse concerning double payment for a thief: “For any matter of trespass, from an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or <b>for any lost item about which one shall say:</b> This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges; the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). It can be seen from here that double payment applies to a false claim of theft even with regard to a lost item. |
| Exodus 22:8 | when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges” | Bava Kamma106b:17 | <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“If a man gives</b> his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard, and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The use of the word “man” indicates that the <b>giving</b> of a deposit <b>by a minor is nothing. And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case <b>where he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is</b> still a <b>minor. From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> would be the same in a case where <b>he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., the claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> both done when he is an adult. |
| Exodus 22:8 | This is it” | Bava Kamma106b:21 | § The Gemara quotes a related ruling: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, <b>he is not obligated</b> to take an oath, nor to pay double payment, <b>until he denies part of</b> the claim <b>and admits to part of</b> the claim. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As the verse states:</b> “About which one shall say: <b>This is it”</b> (Exodus 22:8), indicating an admittance of only this part, but no more. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this <b>disagrees</b> with the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | “For any matter of trespass” | Bava Kamma54b:9 | <b>With regard to the double payment</b> of a thief, it is <b>as we say</b> in a halakhic exegesis of the verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), that it is a general statement which <b>includes any matter</b> of <b>negligence. With regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item,</b> the verse states comprehensively: <b>“For every lost thing of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>unloading</b> a burden, <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal. |
| Exodus 22:8 | as the Sages taught | Bava Kamma62b:13 | § The mishna teaches <b>that the principle of double payment applies</b> both to the theft of something that is alive and to the theft of something that is not alive. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For any matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or for any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges, the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> is <b>a generalization; “whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And when the verse states: <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing,” it then generalizes</b> again. |
| Exodus 22:8 | But how can you say this? But isn’t “garment” written | Bava Kamma62b:17 | The Gemara objects to the question: <b>But how can you say this? But isn’t “garment” written</b> in the list of specified items (Exodus 22:8)? It is impossible to speak of the impurity of carcasses with regard to clothing. The Gemara responds: <b>Say,</b> in response to this objection: <b>We are speaking</b> specifically <b>of animals,</b> and this is the question that was asked: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to animals,</b> an animal <b>whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment, whereas an animal <b>whose carcass does not transmit impurity through contact and carrying,</b> such as a bird, <b>no,</b> a thief would not pay double payment for stealing it? |
| Exodus 22:8 | “For any matter of trespass” | Bava Kamma63a:10 | <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>this</b> later verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), <b>is also coming</b> to state <b>a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization, <b>let the Merciful One write these details,</b> i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment, which are cited in the later verse, <b>together with that</b> previous <b>generalization, and detail,</b> and generalization. <b>Why do I</b> need the latter verse beginning with <b>“for any matter of trespass”? Conclude from it</b> that the word <i>kol</i> <b>is an amplification</b> in this instance, and it includes all animals. |
| Exodus 22:8 | here, | Bava Kamma63a:8 | The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question that the term <b><i>bekhol</i></b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the term <b><i>kol</i> is an amplification. And if you wish, say</b> an alternate answer: The word <b><i>kol</i></b> is usually <b>a generalization. But</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> that is</b> written <b>here,</b> in the verse concerning double payment (Exodus 22:8), is an exception. It is regarded as <b>an amplification,</b> as the Gemara will explain. |
| Exodus 22:8 | he pays double payment, as it is stated: “For any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: | Bava Kamma63b:1 | <b>a lost item</b> that he had found, which he had been obligated to safeguard until it could be returned to its owner, <b>he pays double payment, as it is stated: “For any manner of lost thing about which one shall say:</b> This is it…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). |
| Exodus 22:8 | “The one whom the judges convict | Bava Kamma64b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>both</b> verses are speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who applies this</b> verse: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found,” to the thief himself, from where do we</b> derive that <b>one who incriminates himself</b> is exempt from paying double payment or any other fine? The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that only one who is convicted by the judges on the basis of testimony must pay double, <b>but not one who incriminates himself.</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | fourfold or fivefold payment. | Bava Kamma68b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it, <b>and subsequently slaughtered</b> it, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the owner of the animal, <b>but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The Torah states: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). The word “neighbor” excludes the case of one who steals a consecrated item from the Temple treasury. Since there is no double payment to the Temple treasury there can be no fourfold or fivefold payment either, as the fourfold or fivefold payment is considered an addition to, not a replacement of, the double payment (see 75a). Therefore, a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment to the Temple treasury for slaughtering one of its animals. |
| Exodus 22:8 | “The one whom the judges convict | Bava Kamma75a:7 | Rav asks: But <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to teach this here? This principle is already <b>derived from</b> a different source: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that self-incrimination is insufficient to render one liable for double payment. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the fact that there are two verses to serve as the source for this principle that one who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from paying even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. The second verse teaches this additional novelty. |
| Exodus 22:8 | “For every matter of [ devar ] trespass” | Bava Metzia44a:1 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that one is liable to pay for intent to misappropriate a deposit? It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> It is written with regard to misappropriation: <b>“For every matter of [<i>devar</i>] trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The term <i>devar</i>, literally, word, <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is liable</b> to pay <b>for a thought</b> of misappropriation just <b>as</b> he is for <b>an action.</b> One pays for a matter of trespass even if there is no actual trespass. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He is liable</b> to pay <b>only</b> if <b>he</b> actually <b>misappropriates</b> the deposit, <b>as it is stated: “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7). <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: But isn’t it already stated: “For every matter of trespass”? Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: But isn’t it already stated: “Whether he has misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”?</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | as the Sages taught | Bava Metzia57b:8 | § The mishna teaches: Slaves, documents, land, and consecrated property <b>are not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>payment of double</b> the principal. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For any matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or for any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges, the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to the other” (Exodus 22:8). <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> is <b>a generalization; “whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And when the verse states: <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing,” it then generalizes</b> again. |
| Exodus 22:8 | an oath | Bava Metzia5a:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> Rav Sheshet, with regard to <b>the one who says that</b> in a case where the debtor says: <b>Here you are,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, <b>why was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> a claim of <b>land</b> ownership <b>from</b> the defendant’s obligation to take <b>an oath</b> when he admits part of the claim? The exclusion of land is derived from the verse: “For any matter of trespass, for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, for any lost item about which one shall say: This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges” (Exodus 22:8). <b>But all</b> cases involving one who admits to part of the claim involving <b>land</b> are cases where the defendant effectively says: <b>Here you are,</b> as land always remains in its location. Therefore, the derivation from the verse appears to be unnecessary. |
| Exodus 22:8 | for any lost item about which one shall say: This is it, | Bava Metzia5a:8 | To counter this, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to bailees: “For any matter of trespass, for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, <b>for any lost item about which one shall say: This is it,</b> the claims of both of them shall come before the judges” (Exodus 22:8). This indicates that <b>you obligate</b> the defendant to take an oath based <b>on the admission</b> to part of a claim by <b>his mouth, but you do not obligate him</b> to take an oath based <b>on the testimony of witnesses.</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | “For every matter of trespass” | Kiddushin 42b:11 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah uses the inclusive term “every” with regard to one suspected of misappropriating a deposit: <b>“For every matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> This inclusive term “every” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> speech and <b>thought,</b> i.e., intent to misappropriate, <b>like action. And Beit Hillel say: One is liable only if he</b> actually <b>misappropriates it, as</b> it <b>is stated: “Whether he has not put his hand</b> unto his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). |
| Exodus 22:8 | “He whom the court shall condemn” | Sanhedrin 3b:17 | Therefore, the previous explanation must be rejected. <b>Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: It is stated in the next verse: <b>“He whom the court shall condemn”</b> (Exodus 22:8) in the plural, which means there must be <b>two</b> judges. Consequently, <b>it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>below and it is stated: “The court,”</b> in the verse <b>above. Just as below</b> it is referring to <b>two</b> judges, as the word: “Shall condemn,” is written in the plural, <b>so too above</b> it is referring to <b>two</b> judges, making a total of four. <b>And</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they add another one to them, so there are five</b> judges <b>here.</b> |
| Exodus 22:8 | said, | Sanhedrin 4a:3 | The Gemara explains the basis for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s assertion with regard to each of the <i>tanna’im</i> that he mentioned: With regard to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the proof is <b>that which we have</b> just <b>said,</b> with regard to the interpretation of the verse: “He whom the court shall condemn” (Exodus 22:8) deriving a requirement for five judges in cases of monetary law based on the vocalized plural pronunciation of the term: “Shall condemn.” |
| Exodus 22:8 | This is it” | Shevuot 39b:10 | <b>And the verses are</b> precise <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as it is written</b> with regard to the case where an oath is administered due to admission to part of a claim: <b>“If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard”</b> (Exodus 22:6). It is derived from the juxtaposition of silver and vessels that <b>just as “vessels,”</b> in the plural, is referring to at least <b>two, so too, “silver”</b> is referring to at least <b>two</b> <i>ma’a</i> of silver. It is derived further that <b>just as silver is an item of substantial value, so too, any item of substantial value</b> is included. <b>And the Merciful One states</b> in the subsequent verses that an oath is administered in a case “where one says: <b>This is it”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., where the defendant admits to only part of the claim of “silver or vessels” and denies the rest of the claim. Evidently, the denial can be for an amount less than two silver <i>ma’a</i>. |
| Exodus 22:8 | as the Sages taught | Shevuot 42b:16 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is exempt from the <b>payment of double</b> the principal with regard to the items mentioned in the mishna? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For every matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for clothing, or for any manner of lost thing…he shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). This verse is expounded in the following manner: The phrase <b>“for every matter of trespass” is a generalization;</b> the phrase <b>“whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for clothing” is a detail;</b> and when the verse states: <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing,” it then generalized again.</b> |
| Exodus 22:9 | with it, | Bava Metzia94b:19 | <b>Rather,</b> the liability of a borrower in a case where the animal is captured is derived as follows: The cases where the animal is <b>injured or dies are stated in</b> the passage <b>about a borrower, and</b> similarly the cases where it is <b>injured or dies are stated in</b> the passage <b>about a paid bailee. Just as below,</b> i.e., in the passage in the Torah concerning a paid bailee, the case in which it is <b>captured is</b> included <b>with it,</b> as the verse there states: “If a man deliver to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to safeguard, and it die, or be hurt, or is captured” (Exodus 22:9); <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a borrower, the case where it is <b>captured is</b> included <b>with it.</b> |
| Exodus 22:9 | “And if a man deliver to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, | Nazir 35a:5 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: He derives it from this verse,</b> which deals with a bailee: <b>“And if a man deliver to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep,</b> or any animal to guard, and it dies…the oath of the Lord shall be between them both” (Exodus 22:9). The phrase “a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep” is <b>a detail; “or any animal”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that includes all animals; and in the phrase <b>“to guard”</b> the Torah <b>detailed again.</b> This is <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail.</b> In this case, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail;</b> i.e., items that can be guarded. |
| Exodus 22:9 | as the Sages taught | Shevuot 43a:3 | § The mishna teaches that <b>a paid bailee does not pay</b> for the loss or theft of one of these items. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse introduces the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to a paid bailee with the phrase: “If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any animal to guard” (Exodus 22:9). The phrase <b>“if a man delivers to his neighbor” is a generalization,</b> the phrase <b>“a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep” is a detail,</b> and when the verse states: <b>“Or any animal to safeguard,” it then generalized</b> again. Consequently, this verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> which excludes any item that is not similar to the detail, as delineated in the previous <i>baraita</i> with regard to an unpaid bailee, <b>up to</b> and including the last clause of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>Consecrated</b> property is excluded because it <b>is written</b> in the verse: “If a man delivers to <b>his neighbor.”</b> |
| Exodus 22:10 | “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” | Bava Kamma106a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>But Rav quoted a verse,</b> so how could Rav Naḥman not agree with his statement? The Sages <b>said</b> in response: This <b>verse</b> was not written to teach the ruling of Rav; rather, <b>it comes to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> that <b>all those</b> discussed <b>in the Torah</b> who are required to <b>take oaths, take oaths and do not pay;</b> as the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10), teaching that <b>one who has</b> the obligation <b>to pay is</b> the one who <b>takes an oath,</b> and not the one demanding payment. |
| Exodus 22:10 | and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” | Bava Kamma106a:3 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What</b> is the meaning of Ilfa’s statement that <b>an oath effects acquisition?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>took an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; <b>and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b> Ilfa’s statement that an oath effects acquisition means that the bailee will no longer have to pay monetary restitution, and it does not relate to Rav Sheshet’s statement that the bailee becomes responsible for damage resulting from accidents as soon as he denies the claim. |
| Exodus 22:10 | exempt, as it is stated: “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” | Bava Kamma106a:4 | § Having mentioned Rav’s ruling, the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b> |
| Exodus 22:10 | is stated later, | Bava Kamma63b:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the homeowner shall approach the judges</b> to determine if he laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This means that he shall come to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath.</b> Do <b>you say</b> he comes to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath, or is it only for</b> the purpose of facing <b>judgment?</b> The meaning may be determined by means of a verbal analogy. <b>Laying</b> the <b>hand [<i>shliḥut yad</i>],</b> referring to misappropriation, <b>is stated later,</b> in the verse: “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>and laying the hand is stated above,</b> i.e., Exodus 22:7. <b>Just as laying</b> the <b>hand later</b> is referring explicitly <b>to an oath, so too</b> laying the hand <b>here</b> is referring <b>to an oath.</b> |
| Exodus 22:10 | to judgment? Misappropriation is stated below, | Bava Metzia41b:8 | <b>And the other</b> mention is <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And the master of the house shall approach the judges</b> to determine whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This is stated with regard <b>to an oath.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is stated with regard <b>to an oath, or</b> is it stated <b>only</b> with regard <b>to judgment? Misappropriation is stated below,</b> in a later verse in the chapter: “Whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>and misappropriation is stated above,</b> in an earlier verse in the chapter: “Whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). <b>Just as below</b> it is stated explicitly with regard <b>to an oath:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both to determine whether he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>so too here,</b> it is stated with regard <b>to an oath</b> and not merely for judgment. |
| Exodus 22:10 | “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both” | Shevuot 39b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> designation is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Tarfon says</b> that the verse: <b>“The oath of the Lord shall be between them both”</b> (Exodus 22:10), <b>teaches that</b> the punishment for a false <b>oath applies to both</b> the one who took the oath and the one who administered it to him. |
| Exodus 22:10 | and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” | Shevuot 45a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>All</b> those <b>who take an oath that</b> is legislated <b>by the Torah take an oath and do not pay.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that oaths mandated by Torah law serve only to exempt one from payment? We derive it from the fact <b>that the verse states:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand on his neighbor’s goods; <b>and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10). According to the verse, with regard to <b>he who would</b> otherwise <b>need to pay,</b> it is <b>on him</b> that the obligation to take the <b>oath</b> is imposed. |
| Exodus 22:10 | “the oath of the Lord shall be between them both” | Shevuot 47a:11 | <b>Rava said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Abba; as Rabbi Ami teaches</b> this <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that <b>“the oath of the Lord shall be between them both”</b> (Exodus 22:10), <b>but not between their heirs. What are the circumstances</b> in which one would be liable to take an oath, but his heirs would be exempt? |
| Exodus 22:10 | “The oath of the Lord | Shevuot 47b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav and Shmuel,</b> who hold that one who cannot take an oath does not have to pay, and therefore there is no difference between the heirs and the father, <b>what do they derive from this</b> verse: <b>“The oath of the Lord</b> shall be between them both” (Exodus 22:10)? |
| Exodus 22:10 | “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, | Temurah 3b:16 | The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>even</b> one who utters <b>a true oath</b> is flogged, as this too could be considered exhibiting insufficient fear of God’s name? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written explicitly</b> that a bailee may take an oath in court, as the verse states: <b>“The oath of the Lord shall be between them both,</b> to see whether he has not damaged his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10). |
| Exodus 22:11 | theft, as it is written: “If it is stolen from him, he must pay its owner” | Bava Metzia94b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> a paid bailee is liable in the case of <b>theft, as it is written: “If it is stolen from him, he must pay its owner”</b> (Exodus 22:11). <b>But</b> in a case of <b>loss, from where do we</b> derive that a paid bailee is liable? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“If it is stolen [<i>ganov yigganev</i>],” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a paid bailee is liable if the item he is safeguarding is <b>stolen; from where</b> do I derive he is liable also if it is <b>lost? The verse states: “<i>ganov yigganev</i>,”</b> repeating the verb for emphasis. This teaches that he is liable <b>in any case,</b> i.e., for loss as well as theft. |
| Exodus 22:12 | “If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness, the torn animal he shall not pay” | Bava Kamma10b:16 | <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee who did not fulfill his duty to safeguard it, and the animal was attacked by a wild beast: <b>“If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness, the torn animal he shall not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:12). Rav Kahana expounds the verse to mean that <b>he shall pay</b> only up <b>until</b> the value of the <b>torn animal;</b> but <b>he shall not pay</b> for the <b>torn animal itself.</b> In other words, he pays only the difference in value between the animal before it was injured and its current torn state. If the owner of the injured animal wishes to fully recover his loss he must sell the animal’s carcass and keep the proceeds. |
| Exodus 22:12 | “If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness [ ed ]” | Bava Kamma10b:28 | The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee and was attacked by a wild beast: <b>“If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness [<i>ed</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:12). |
| Exodus 22:13 | “And if [ vekhi ] a man borrow” | Bava Kamma107b:3 | Rava continues: Rami bar Ḥama learns the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a borrower</b> from the verse: <b>“And if [<i>vekhi</i>] a man borrow”</b> (Exodus 22:13). There is a principle that the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous topic.</b> Based on this principle, the <i>halakhot</i> of a borrower are connected to those of the subject of the previous verse, the bailee. Concerning <b>a renter, if</b> Rami bar Ḥama is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like a paid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>a paid bailee; if</b> he is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like an unpaid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>an unpaid bailee.</b> |
| Exodus 22:13 | “And it breaks or dies, | Bava Kamma57b:4 | Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Yosef from that which is taught in another <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a case where one borrows an object or an animal from another: <b>“And it breaks or dies,</b> he shall pay restitution [<i>shalem yeshalem</i>]” (Exodus 22:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the borrower is liable in a case where the object or animal <b>breaks or dies;</b> but <b>from where</b> do I derive that he is also liable if it was <b>stolen or lost? You</b> can <b>state</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as a paid bailee, whom</b> the Torah <b>rendered exempt</b> in a case where the item <b>breaks or dies,</b> is nevertheless <b>liable for</b> a case of <b>theft or loss,</b> then with regard to <b>a borrower, who</b> is <b>liable</b> even if the item <b>breaks or dies, is not it logical that he is liable for theft or loss? And this is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>that has no refutation.</b> |
| Exodus 22:13 | as it is stated: “If its owner is not with him, he shall pay” | Bava Metzia94b:1 | <b>But</b> if one first <b>borrowed the cow and</b> only <b>afterward borrowed</b> the services of <b>the owner or hired him, and</b> the cow <b>died,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay the owner for the cow. This is the <i>halakha</i> even if the owner was working for the borrower at the time, <b>as it is stated: “If its owner is not with him, he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:13). |
| Exodus 22:13 | injured or dies, as it is written: “And if a man borrows from another and it is injured or dies… | Bava Metzia94b:17 | § The mishna cited above states: <b>And the borrower</b> does not take an oath, but <b>pays</b> for <b>every</b> outcome, whether it was stolen or lost, even in a circumstance beyond his control. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the bailee is liable if the animal is <b>injured or dies, as it is written: “And if a man borrows from another and it is injured or dies…</b>he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13). <b>But from where do we</b> derive the liability <b>of a borrower</b> when the animal is <b>captured?</b> |
| Exodus 22:13 | “or” | Bava Metzia94b:21 | <b>Rather,</b> the liability of a borrower in a case where the animal is captured is derived <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The word <b>“or”</b> in the phrase “injured or dies” (Exodus 22:13) serves <b>to include</b> the case in which the animal was <b>captured.</b> |
| Exodus 22:13 | “And when a man borrows from another, and it is injured or dies, if its owner is not with him, he shall pay” | Bava Metzia94b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is clear that the <b>third</b> passage is <b>about a borrower,</b> as the verse <b>explicitly</b> states: <b>“And when a man borrows from another, and it is injured or dies, if its owner is not with him, he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:13). <b>But</b> with regard to the claim of the <i>baraita</i> that the <b>first</b> passage is <b>about an unpaid bailee</b> and the <b>second is about a paid bailee, I could</b> also say the <b>reverse,</b> as the verses do not state which type of bailee they are referring to. |
| Exodus 22:13 | The verse states: “And if he borrows” | Bava Metzia95a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a bailee who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is stolen or lost is derived as follows: <b>The verse states: “And if he borrows”</b> (Exodus 22:13). The conjunctive <b>“and”</b> indicates that the passage detailing the liability of a borrower <b>is adding to the first matter,</b> i.e., it should be seen as a continuation of the previous passage detailing the liability of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>let the</b> case of a paid bailee <b>above be derived from</b> the case <b>below</b> of the borrower, including the exemption from liability in a case in which the services of the owner were borrowed at the same time as the animal. |
| Exodus 22:13 | The verse states: “And if he borrows” | Bava Metzia95a:17 | <b>Rather,</b> it is derived as follows: <b>The verse states: “And if he borrows”</b> (Exodus 22:13). The conjunctive <b>“and”</b> indicates that the passage detailing the liability of a borrower <b>is adding to the first matter,</b> i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> therefore <b>let the</b> case of a paid bailee <b>above be derived from</b> the case <b>below</b> of the borrower, <b>and</b> <i>halakhot</i> applying to the case <b>below,</b> of a borrower, can be derived <b>from the</b> case <b>above,</b> of a paid bailee. |
| Exodus 22:13 | “And it is injured or dies” | Bava Metzia95a:5 | <b>Rather,</b> a borrower’s liability for theft and loss is derived <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“And it is injured or dies”</b> (Exodus 22:13), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a borrower is liable if the animal is <b>injured or dies. From where</b> do I derive that he is liable in a case of <b>theft or loss? You can say</b> it is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a paid bailee, who is exempt from</b> liability in a case in which the animal is <b>injured or dies,</b> is nevertheless <b>liable in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss,</b> then with regard to <b>a borrower, who is liable</b> in a case in which the animal is <b>injured or dies, isn’t it logical that he should</b> also <b>be liable in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss? And this is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>that has no refutation.</b> |
| Exodus 22:13 | that “if its owner is not with him, he shall pay” | Bava Metzia95b:13 | <b>And furthermore,</b> even the second part of Rav Hamnuna’s ruling, that the exemption applies only when the owner was working for the borrower from the time of the borrowing of the animal until the time of the mishap, can be refuted, as <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the implication of that which is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:14), <b>do I not</b> already <b>know</b> what is stated in the next verse, <b>that “if its owner is not with him, he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:13)? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its owner is not with him”?</b> It serves <b>to tell you:</b> If <b>he was with him,</b> i.e., working for him, <b>at</b> the <b>time of borrowing, he does not need to be with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies</b> for the exemption from liability to apply; but if he <b>was with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies, he</b> does <b>need to have been with him at</b> the <b>time of borrowing</b> for the exemption from liability to apply. |
| Exodus 22:13 | The verse states: “And when a man borrows from another… | Bava Metzia96a:7 | <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that the borrower’s exemption from liability is dependent upon the time of the borrowing can be derived from the verse itself: <b>The verse states: “And when a man borrows from another…</b>he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13). The precise formulation of the verse indicates that he borrowed an item from another, <b>but</b> that <b>other</b> person <b>was not with him,</b> i.e., working for him, at the time. It is only in such a case that that verse concludes: <b>“He shall pay.”</b> By inference, when the <b>other person</b> is working <b>with him,</b> the borrower is <b>exempt.</b> Accordingly, it is clear that the critical moment is the time of the borrowing. |
| Exodus 22:14 | as it is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay” | Bava Metzia94a:16 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who borrowed a cow and borrowed</b> the services of <b>its owner with it, or</b> he borrowed a cow and <b>hired its owner with it,</b> or he <b>borrowed</b> the services of <b>the owner or hired him and afterward borrowed the cow;</b> in all such cases, if the cow <b>died,</b> the borrower is <b>exempt</b> from liability. Although a borrower is generally liable to pay if a cow he borrowed dies, here he is exempt, <b>as it is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:14). |
| Exodus 22:14 | “If its owner is with him, | Bava Metzia95a:20 | <b>Accordingly,</b> the verse: <b>“If its owner is with him,</b> he does not pay” (Exodus 22:14), which appears in the passage of a borrower, <b>is not written in reference to an unpaid bailee,</b> and so that exemption from liability does not apply to him. <b>And in addition,</b> the liability for <b>negligence,</b> which appears in the passage of an unpaid bailee, <b>is not written in reference to a paid bailee or a borrower. Accordingly,</b> the <b>liability of a paid bailee and of a borrower</b> in a case of negligence <b>is derived</b> only <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the liability of an unpaid bailee, not from an explicit verse. |
| Exodus 22:14 | From the implication of that which is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay” | Bava Metzia95b:13 | <b>And furthermore,</b> even the second part of Rav Hamnuna’s ruling, that the exemption applies only when the owner was working for the borrower from the time of the borrowing of the animal until the time of the mishap, can be refuted, as <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the implication of that which is stated: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:14), <b>do I not</b> already <b>know</b> what is stated in the next verse, <b>that “if its owner is not with him, he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:13)? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its owner is not with him”?</b> It serves <b>to tell you:</b> If <b>he was with him,</b> i.e., working for him, <b>at</b> the <b>time of borrowing, he does not need to be with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies</b> for the exemption from liability to apply; but if he <b>was with him at</b> the <b>time when</b> the animal is <b>injured or dies, he</b> does <b>need to have been with him at</b> the <b>time of borrowing</b> for the exemption from liability to apply. |
| Exodus 22:14 | “Its owner is with him” | Bava Metzia95b:6 | § <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that the exemption from liability when one borrows an item together with the services of its owner exists only in very specific circumstances: A borrower <b>is always liable, unless</b> the item entrusted to him <b>is a cow and</b> its owner <b>plows with it</b> in the service of the borrower, or it is <b>a donkey and</b> its owner <b>drives it</b> by walking <b>behind it</b> in the service of the borrower, i.e., the owner and his animal are engaged in the same work. <b>And</b> even so, the borrower will not be exempt <b>unless the owner</b> is working for him <b>from</b> the <b>time of the borrowing</b> of the animal <b>until</b> the <b>time when it is injured or dies.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Evidently,</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>holds</b> that the phrase: <b>“Its owner is with him”</b> (Exodus 22:14), <b>teaches</b> that the exemption from liability applies only when the owner is working for the borrower <b>for the entire matter.</b> |
| Exodus 22:15 | who was not betrothed” | Ketubot 38a:10 | <b>If so,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> can be logically inferred, <b>why does the verse state: “Who was not betrothed”?</b> This verse is <b>free,</b> as it is superfluous in its own context, <b>and</b> it is written <b>to liken</b> another case to it, <b>and to derive from it a verbal analogy: It is stated here</b> with regard to a woman who was raped: <b>“Who was not betrothed,” and it is stated below:</b> “And if a man seduce a virgin <b>who was not betrothed”</b> (Exodus 22:15). <b>Just as here,</b> with regard to rape, the Torah specifies that the payment is <b>fifty</b> silver pieces (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>so too below,</b> with regard to seduction, the payment is <b>fifty. And just as below,</b> with regard to seduction, the payment is in <b>shekels,</b> as it is written: “He shall weigh [<i>yishkol</i>] money” (Exodus 22:16), <b>so too here,</b> the payment is in <b>shekels.</b> |
| Exodus 22:15 | “He shall pay a dowry for her to be a wife to him” | Ketubot 40a:1 | <b>for this matter too,</b> marrying the woman against his will, <b>let them be derived from each other.</b> Rav Ashi replied that <b>the verse says</b> with regard to a seducer: <b>“He shall pay a dowry for her to be a wife to him”</b> (Exodus 22:15); <b>“to him”</b> means <b>in accordance with his will.</b> |
| Exodus 22:15 | “He shall pay a dowry for her to be his wife” | Kiddushin 46a:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said to him: If so,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case where intercourse was not performed to effect betrothal, <b>this is what we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a seduced woman: <b>“He shall pay a dowry for her to be his wife”</b> (Exodus 22:15). This teaches <b>that she requires betrothal from him. And if</b> the verse is speaking of one who <b>seduced her for the sake of marriage, why do I</b> need <b>betrothal?</b> The act of intercourse can serve as the betrothal. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case where he seduced her not for the sake of marriage. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> Even if he seduced her for the sake of marriage, <b>she requires</b> an additional <b>betrothal with her father’s consent,</b> since she is a minor and became betrothed without it. |
| Exodus 22:16 | “He shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins” | Ketubot 10a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel say that? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written with regard to a seducer: <b>“He shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins”</b> (Exodus 22:16)? The Torah establishes that <b>this</b> fine <b>will be like the dowry of a virgin,</b> and that <b>the dowry of a virgin</b> will be <b>like this</b> fine, i.e., fifty silver <i>sela</i>, or two hundred dinars. <b>From here the Sages based</b> their determination <b>that a woman’s marriage contract is</b> an obligation <b>by Torah</b> law. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The marriage contract of a woman is not</b> an obligation <b>by Torah law, but</b> is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> |
| Exodus 22:16 | “He shall weigh [ yishkol ] money like the dowry of the virgins” | Ketubot 29b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And Reish Lakish, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not cite</b> the source <b>as Rav Pappa</b> did? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> derivation from the three instances of the term virgin is <b>required by him to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written with regard to a seducer: <b>“He shall weigh [<i>yishkol</i>] money like the dowry of the virgins”</b> (Exodus 22:16), from which it is derived <b>that this</b> fine of a seducer <b>should be</b> a sum of fifty <i>sela</i> <b>like the dowry of the virgins</b> specified in the case of a rapist; <b>and the dowry of the virgins must be</b> paid in <i>sela</i> <b>like this</b> fine of the seducer. Therefore, Reish Lakish holds that no additional matters may be derived from the term virgins. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>Reish Lakish too,</b> isn’t it <b>required by him to</b> teach <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Abaye</b> said? <b>And</b> similarly, for <b>Rav Pappa,</b> isn’t it <b>required by him to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy?</b> |
| Exodus 22:16 | shekels, | Ketubot 38a:10 | <b>If so,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> can be logically inferred, <b>why does the verse state: “Who was not betrothed”?</b> This verse is <b>free,</b> as it is superfluous in its own context, <b>and</b> it is written <b>to liken</b> another case to it, <b>and to derive from it a verbal analogy: It is stated here</b> with regard to a woman who was raped: <b>“Who was not betrothed,” and it is stated below:</b> “And if a man seduce a virgin <b>who was not betrothed”</b> (Exodus 22:15). <b>Just as here,</b> with regard to rape, the Torah specifies that the payment is <b>fifty</b> silver pieces (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>so too below,</b> with regard to seduction, the payment is <b>fifty.

| Exodus 22:16 | “He shall weigh money like the dowry of the virgins” | Ketubot 38b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> derive <b>this conclusion</b> with regard to the amount of the payment for seduction and the type of money used in the payment for rape? The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written with regard to seduction: <b>“He shall weigh money like the dowry of the virgins”</b> (Exodus 22:16), from which it is derived <b>that this</b> fine for seduction <b>will be like the dowry</b> paid <b>to the virgins</b> elsewhere for rape, fifty silver coins, <b>and the dowry</b> paid <b>to the virgins</b> for rape <b>will be like this</b> fine for seduction in shekels. |
| Exodus 22:16 | a woman who was seduced, it is written: “If her father refuses [ maen yemaen ] | Ketubot 39b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>a woman who was seduced, it is written: “If her father refuses [<i>maen yemaen</i>]</b> to give her to him” (Exodus 22:16), and the Sages interpreted: <b>I have only</b> derived that <b>her father</b> can prevent the marriage; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>she herself</b> can do so? <b>The verse states:</b> <i>Maen <b>yemaen</b></i><b>,</b> a double verb indicating that the marriage can be prevented <b>in any case,</b> i.e., she too may do so. |
| Exodus 22:16 | “If her father utterly refuse [ ma’en yima’en ] | Ketubot 44b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida, raised an objection to this</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a seduced young woman: <b>“If her father utterly refuse [<i>ma’en yima’en</i>]</b> to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins” (Exodus 22:16). The double phrase “utterly refuse [<i>ma’en yima’en</i>]” comes <b>to include an orphan for</b> the <b>fine,</b> i.e., if she does not have a father and she herself refuses to marry her seducer, he must pay her the fine. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> This proves that the fact that the girl does not have a father does not exempt her seducer from paying the fine. |
| Exodus 22:16 | “If her father refuses | Kiddushin 46a:2 | § <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue: In the case of <b>a minor girl who became betrothed without her father’s consent, Rav says: Either she or her father is able to prevent</b> the betrothal from taking effect. <b>And Rav Asi says: Her father</b> can prevent it <b>but not she,</b> since she initially agreed. <b>Rav Huna raised an objection to Rav Asi, and some say</b> it was <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> who raised an objection <b>to Rav Asi:</b> The <i>baraita</i> states in the case of a seduced woman: <b>“If her father refuses</b> to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins” (Exodus 22:16). The Sages expounded: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>her father</b> can refuse to give her to the seducer in marriage; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>she herself</b> can also refuse? <b>The verse states: “If he refuses [<i>ma’en yema’en</i>].”</b> The repetition of the verb indicates that the right of refusal exists <b>in any case.</b> Despite the fact that she was seduced, she can change her mind and say that she does not want to marry him. |
| Exodus 22:17 | ben Azzai says: It is stated: “You shall not allow a sorceress to live” | Berakhot 21b:10 | <b>And from where do we derive</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not derive homiletic interpretations</b> from juxtaposed verses <b>throughout the entire Torah? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the punishment of a sorceress, <b>ben Azzai says: It is stated: “You shall not allow a sorceress to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), although the manner of her execution is not specified, <b>and it is stated: “Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18).

| Exodus 22:17 | “You shall not allow a witch to live” | Sanhedrin 60a:1 | <b>“You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18).

| Exodus 22:17 | “You shall not allow a witch to live” | Sanhedrin 67a:19 | The mishna teaches that the case of <b>the warlock is</b> referring to <b>one who performs</b> a real <b>act</b> of sorcery. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), does not refer only to a female who practices sorcery; <b>both a man and a woman</b> are included. <b>If so, why</b> does <b>verse state “a witch”?</b> This is <b>because most women are familiar with witchcraft.</b> |
| Exodus 22:17 | it is stated: “You shall not allow a witch to live” | Sanhedrin 67b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Azzai says</b> that <b>it is stated: “You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), <b>and it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18).

| Exodus 22:18 | As it is written: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 15a:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of the one who</b> actively <b>lies</b> with the animal, i.e., a male who sexually penetrates the animal, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of the one who</b> causes the animal to <b>lie with</b> him, by being penetrated by the animal. There is another verse (Leviticus 20:15) that explicitly addresses a man penetrating the animal sexually; this verse from Exodus is therefore understood to be referring to the case where he causes the animal to penetrate him. <b>And the Merciful One brought</b> this <b>forth</b> using <b>the</b> active <b>term “lies,” to compare one who</b> causes the animal to <b>lie with</b> him <b>to one who</b> actively <b>lies</b> with the animal, in order to teach that <b>just as</b> in a case of <b>one who lies</b> with an animal, <b>he and his animal are</b> to be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b>one who</b> causes an animal to <b>lie with</b> him, <b>he and his animal</b> are to be judged <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. |
| Exodus 22:18 | The verse states: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 54b:6 | <b>We have learned</b> the <b>punishment for one who engages in bestiality</b> actively, but <b>from where</b> do we derive <b>the punishment for one who engages in bestiality</b> passively? <b>The verse states: “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of the one who</b> actively <b>lies</b> with an animal, i.e., a male who sexually penetrates an animal, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of the one who</b> causes an animal to <b>lie with</b> him, by being penetrated by the animal, i.e., any type of intercourse with an animal is punishable by death. |
| Exodus 22:18 | “Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 60a:1 | <b>“You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18).

| Exodus 22:19 | as it is stated: “He that sacrifices to the gods, save to the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed” | Avodah Zarah51a:13 | § <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who slaughters a blemished animal in idolatrous worship that he is exempt?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “He that sacrifices to the gods, save to the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed”</b> (Exodus 22:19). The verse contrasts sacrificing an offering to the Lord with sacrificing an offering to other gods, indicating that <b>the Torah prohibits only</b> sacrificial rites that are <b>comparable to</b> those rites performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, and blemished animals are disqualified from being sacrificed in the Temple. |
| Exodus 22:19 | he shall be utterly destroyed” | Gittin 57b:15 | <b>And they</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son <b>before the emperor,</b> and <b>said to him: Worship the idol.

And so <b>they took him out and killed him.</b> |
| Exodus 22:19 | As the Sages taught | Sanhedrin 60b:8 | The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “One who sacrifices to the gods shall be utterly destroyed, except to the Lord alone” (Exodus 22:19): <b>If it were stated: One who sacrifices shall be utterly destroyed, I would have said</b> that <b>the verse speaks of one who slaughters a sacrificial</b> animal <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, referring to a severe transgression that is stated elsewhere in the Torah. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the gods,”</b> indicating that <b>the verse speaks of one who slaughters</b> an offering <b>to an idol.</b> |
| Exodus 22:19 | save to the Lord only, | Sanhedrin 63a:17 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said to him: But isn’t anyone who links the name of Heaven and something else,</b> a euphemism for an idol, <b>uprooted from the world? As it is stated:</b> “He who sacrifices to the gods, <b>save to the Lord only,</b> shall be utterly destroyed” (Exodus 22:19). The fact that the Jewish people included God in their idolatrous statement could not have saved them from destruction. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Which brought you up”</b> in the plural? The verse teaches <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>desired many gods;</b> they were not satisfied with the golden calf alone. |
| Exodus 22:19 | save unto the Lord only, | Sukkah 45b:7 | § The mishna asks: <b>At the time of their departure</b> at the end of the Festival, <b>what</b> would <b>they say?</b> The mishna answers that they would praise the altar and glorify God. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> in doing so <b>aren’t they joining the name of Heaven and another entity, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Anyone who joins the name of Heaven and another entity is uprooted from the world, as it is stated:</b> “He that sacrifices unto the gods, <b>save unto the Lord only,</b> shall be utterly destroyed” (Exodus 22:19)? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the people <b>are saying</b> when they depart the Temple: <b>To the Lord, we acknowledge</b> that He is our God, <b>and to you,</b> the altar, <b>we give praise; to the Lord, we acknowledge</b> that He is our God, <b>and to you,</b> the altar, <b>we give acclaim.</b> The praise to God and the praise to the altar are clearly distinct. |
| Exodus 22:20 | may not say to him: Remember the deeds of your ancestors, as it is stated: “And a convert shall you neither mistreat, nor shall you oppress him” | Bava Metzia58b:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Just as</b> there is a prohibition against <b>exploitation [<i>ona’a</i>] in buying and selling, so is there <i>ona’a</i> in statements,</b> i.e., verbal mistreatment. The mishna proceeds to cite examples of verbal mistreatment. <b>One may not say to</b> a seller: <b>For how much</b> are you selling <b>this item, if he does not wish to purchase</b> it. He thereby upsets the seller when the deal fails to materialize. The mishna lists other examples: <b>If one is a penitent,</b> another <b>may not say to him: Remember your earlier deeds. If one is the child of converts,</b> another <b>may not say to him: Remember the deeds of your ancestors, as it is stated: “And a convert shall you neither mistreat, nor shall you oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20). |
| Exodus 22:20 | “And you shall neither mistreat a convert” | Bava Metzia59b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to verbal <b>mistreatment, that three prohibitions are written</b> concerning it: <b>“And you shall neither mistreat a convert”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him”</b> (Leviticus 19:33); <b>“And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), <b>and a convert is</b> included in the category of <b>colleague?</b> With regard to <b>one who also oppresses</b> a convert <b>as well, three</b> prohibitions <b>are written:</b> “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, <b>nor oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And you shall not oppress a convert</b> (Exodus 23:9); <b>“And you shall not be to him like a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24). This last prohibition is a general prohibition, <b>in which converts are included.</b> Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. <b>Rather, both this</b> one, who verbally mistreats a convert, <b>and that</b> one, who oppresses him, <b>violate three prohibitions.</b> |
| Exodus 22:20 | which is written: “And you shall not mistreat a convert nor oppress him, because you were strangers in the land of Egypt” | Bava Metzia59b:15 | <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And you shall not mistreat a convert nor oppress him, because you were strangers in the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 22:20)? <b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: A defect that is in you, do not mention</b> it <b>in another.</b> Since the Jewish people were themselves strangers, they are not in a position to demean a convert because he is a stranger in their midst. <b>And this</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: One who has</b> a person <b>hanged in his family [<i>bidyotkei</i>], does not say to another</b> member of his household: <b>Hang a fish for me,</b> as the mention of hanging is demeaning for that family. |
| Exodus 22:23 | Rabbi Eliezer says: By inference, from that which is stated: “My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you” | Bava Metzia38b:14 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: By inference, from that which is stated: “My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you”</b> (Exodus 22:23), <b>I know that their wives</b> shall be <b>widows and their children orphans. Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And your wives shall be</b> widows and your children orphans” (Exodus 22:23)? Why is this clause in the verse necessary? |
| Exodus 22:24 | “And you shall not be to him like a creditor” | Bava Metzia59b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to verbal <b>mistreatment, that three prohibitions are written</b> concerning it: <b>“And you shall neither mistreat a convert”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him”</b> (Leviticus 19:33); <b>“And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), <b>and a convert is</b> included in the category of <b>colleague?</b> With regard to <b>one who also oppresses</b> a convert <b>as well, three</b> prohibitions <b>are written:</b> “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, <b>nor oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And you shall not oppress a convert</b> (Exodus 23:9); <b>“And you shall not be to him like a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24).

The term “My people” teaches that if one of <b>My people,</b> i.e., a Jew, <b>and a gentile</b> both come to borrow money from you, <b>My people take precedence.</b> The term “the poor person” teaches that if <b>a poor person and a rich person</b> come to borrow money, <b>the poor person takes precedence.</b> And from the term: “Who is with you,” it is derived: If <b>your poor person,</b> meaning one of your relatives, <b>and</b> one of <b>the poor of your city</b> come to borrow money, <b>your poor person takes precedence.</b> If it is between one of <b>the poor of your city and</b> one of <b>the poor of another city, the</b> one of <b>the poor of your city takes precedence.</b> |
| Exodus 22:24 | and of: “Do not be to him as a creditor” | Bava Metzia75b:4 | <b>And these</b> people <b>violate a prohibition</b> of interest: <b>The lender, and the borrower, and the guarantor, and the witnesses. And the Rabbis say: Also the scribe</b> who writes the promissory note violates this prohibition. These parties to the transaction <b>violate</b> different prohibtions. Some are in violation of: <b>“You shall not give</b> him your money with interest” (Leviticus 25:37), <b>and of: “Do not take from him</b> interest or increase” (Leviticus 25:36), <b>and of: “Do not be to him as a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24), <b>and of: “And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind, and you shall fear your God; I am the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). |
| Exodus 22:24 | guarantor and the witness violate only: “Do not place interest upon him” | Bava Metzia75b:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> people <b>violate</b> the prohibition of interest. <b>Abaye says:</b> The <b>lender violates all of them,</b> meaning all of the prohibitions listed in the mishna. The <b>borrower violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not lend to your brother with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), as he enables his brother to lend with interest. And they also violate the prohibition: “You may lend to a gentile with interest, but <b>to your brother you shall not lend with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), as well as: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The <b>guarantor and the witness violate only: “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24). |
| Exodus 22:24 | The verse states: “Do not be to him as a creditor” | Bava Metzia75b:8 | § The Gemara cites further statements with regard to loans in general. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he <b>said: From where</b> is it derived that with regard to <b>one who is owed one hundred dinars by another and knows that</b> the borrower <b>does not have</b> the funds to repay him, <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him <b>to pass before</b> the borrower, so as not to embarrass the borrower and cause him discomfort? <b>The verse states: “Do not be to him as a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24). Even if he does not claim the debt from the borrower, his presence reminds the latter of the debt, which distresses him. |
| Exodus 22:24 | and it is written there: “Neither shall you place upon him interest” | Ketubot 46a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Nowhere does the Torah explicitly state that the husband hired false witnesses. The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to a defamer, and the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to the prohibition against charging interest. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a defamer: <b>“And he place wanton charges against her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:14), <b>and it is written there: “Neither shall you place upon him interest”</b> (Exodus 22:24). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to interest, the verse is referring to <b>money, so too here,</b> in the case of a defamer, it is referring to <b>money,</b> thereby indicating that the husband paid money in order to substantiate his false accusation. |
| Exodus 22:25 | “If you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment, | Bava Metzia113b:2 | The Gemara attempts a further proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which the Sages taught: The verse states: <b>“If you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment,</b> you shall restore it to him until the sun goes down” (Exodus 22:25). <b>The verse is speaking of an agent of the court.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>the verse is speaking of an agent of the court, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> referring <b>only to a creditor? When it says: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), the case of <b>a creditor is thereby stated. How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“If you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment”? The verse is speaking of an agent of the court.</b> This indicates that an agent of the court has permission to take collateral. |
| Exodus 22:25 | you shall restore it to him until the sun goes down” | Bava Metzia114b:8 | <b>Rav Sheizevi taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava:</b> With regard to the verse: “And if you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment, <b>you shall restore it to him until the sun goes down”</b> (Exodus 22:25), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a garment</b> worn at <b>night</b> and teaches that the garment is returned during the day; and with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall restore to him the collateral when the sun goes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a garment</b> worn during the <b>day.</b> Rava <b>said to him:</b> This statement is puzzling, as with regard to a garment worn <b>in the day, why do I</b> need it <b>at night, and</b> as for a garment worn <b>at night, why do I</b> need it <b>in the day?</b> What purpose is served by giving back the garments at such times? |
| Exodus 22:25 | take as collateral [ ḥavol taḥbol ] | Bava Metzia31b:5 | The Gemara brings another derivation from a compound verb written with regard to returning collateral: “If you <b>take as collateral [<i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>]</b> your neighbor’s garment, you shall restore it to him until the sun sets” (Exodus 22:25). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to return his garment before sunset in a case where the lender <b>took collateral with the sanction of the court. From where</b> do I derive the obligation to return his garment each night even in a case where the lender <b>took collateral without the sanction of the court? The verse states: “<i>Ḥavol taḥbol</i>,”</b> to teach that he must return it <b>in any case.</b> |
| Exodus 22:27 | it is written: “And you shall not curse a leader among your people” | Bava Batra4a:1 | Herod <b>placed a garland</b> made <b>of porcupine</b> hide <b>on</b> Bava ben Buta’s head, which <b>pricked his eyes out. One day</b> Herod <b>came and sat before him</b> without identifying himself in order to test him. <b>He,</b> Herod, <b>said: See, Master, what this evil slave</b> Herod <b>is doing.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: What should I do to him?</b> Herod <b>said to him:</b> The <b>Master should curse him.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> But <b>it is written: “Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). Herod <b>said to him: He is not a king,</b> since he rules illegally. Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: And</b> even if <b>he were merely a rich man</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And do not curse a rich person in your bedchamber”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). <b>And</b> even <b>were he only a leader</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And you shall not curse a leader among your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27). |
| Exodus 22:27 | nor curse a ruler of your people” | Bava Kamma94b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>due to the honor of their father they are obligated to return</b> the item or money? <b>I will read here</b> the verse: “You shall not revile God, <b>nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which the Sages inferred that the prohibition against cursing a ruler is in effect only <b>with regard to</b> a ruler that <b>acts as</b> a member of <b>your people,</b> i.e., in accordance with Torah law. One who curses a wicked ruler does not violate this prohibition. Similarly, if one’s father is wicked, the mitzva to honor him should not apply. Why would his children have to return items that he stole due to his honor? |
| Exodus 22:27 | we inform him, as it is written: “Nor curse a ruler among your people” | Bava Metzia48b:3 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>we inform him, as it is written: “Nor curse a ruler among your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which it is derived that it is prohibited to curse a ruler or any other member of the Jewish people. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>we curse him,</b> and the prohibition against cursing is not a concern, <b>as it is written: “Among your people,”</b> from which it is derived that the prohibition applies only <b>with regard to one who performs an action</b> befitting <b>your people,</b> not one who reneges on a transaction after the money is paid. |
| Exodus 22:27 | “Nor curse a ruler of your people” | Bava Metzia62a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And these</b> children, <b>are they obligated</b> to take action <b>due to</b> the obligation to uphold <b>their father’s honor? Read</b> and apply <b>here</b> the verse: <b>“Nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which it is inferred that this prohibition applies only <b>to one who performs an action</b> becoming of <b>your people.</b> The actions of the father, who lent money with interest, were unbecoming of the Jewish people. Why then, must his sons uphold his honor? |
| Exodus 22:27 | “And a leader in your people you may not curse” | Makkot 8b:16 | The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, a slave and a Samaritan are exiled and flogged due to a Jew;</b> either of them is <b>exiled</b> in a case <b>where he killed</b> a Jew unintentionally, <b>and flogged</b> in a case <b>where he cursed</b> the Jew, thereby violating a Torah prohibition. <b>But</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a Jew is exiled and flogged due to a Samaritan, granted,</b> the Jew is <b>exiled</b> in a case <b>where</b> he <b>killed</b> the Samaritan unintentionally, <b>but</b> the Jew <b>is flogged for</b> violating <b>what</b> prohibition? <b>For cursing</b> the Samaritan? Isn’t that prohibition derived from the verse: <b>“And a leader in your people you may not curse”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which it is inferred that the prohibition is in effect only <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>performs an action</b> characteristic <b>of your people,</b> who comports himself as an observant, God-fearing Jew? Even if the conversion of the Samaritans was valid, they regularly violate numerous prohibitions, and they do not comport themselves as observant Jews. |
| Exodus 22:27 | from here: “You shall not curse God” | Sanhedrin 56a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> word <b><i>nokev</i> is a term for blessing,</b> i.e., cursing? The Gemara answers that it is derived from the statement of Balaam, who was sent by Balak to curse the Jewish people: <b>“How shall I curse [<i>ekkov</i>] whom God has not cursed?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against cursing God is derived <b>from here: “You shall not curse God”</b> (Exodus 22:27). |
| Exodus 22:27 | The verse states: “You shall not blaspheme judges [ elohim ], | Sanhedrin 66a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>We have learned</b> the <b>punishment</b> of one who curses his parent; <b>from where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against doing so derived? <b>The verse states: “You shall not blaspheme judges [<i>elohim</i>],</b> nor curse a king of your people” (Exodus 22:27). <b>If his father was a judge,</b> cursing him <b>is included in</b> the prohibition of: <b>“You shall not blaspheme judges,”</b> as it is prohibited for all people to curse a judge. <b>And if his father was a king,</b> cursing him <b>is included in</b> the prohibition of: <b>“Nor curse a king of your people.”</b> |
| Exodus 22:27 | This works out well according to the one who says | Sanhedrin 66a:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that in the verse: “You shall not blaspheme <i>elohim</i>” (Exodus 22:27), the word <b>“<i>elohim</i>” is non-sacred,</b> as it is referring to judges. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the word is <b>sacred,</b> as it is referring to God, <b>what can be said?</b> If the verse is not superfluous, as it is needed to state a special prohibition with regard to God, how is the prohibition against cursing one’s parents derived from it? |
| Exodus 22:27 | is exempt: As the verse states: “Nor curse a ruler of your people” | Sanhedrin 85a:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, this is the reason that</b> another <b>is exempt: As the verse states: “Nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which it is inferred that this prohibition applies only <b>with regard to one who performs an action of “your people,”</b> i.e., an action befitting a Jew. There is no prohibition against cursing one whose actions are inconsistent with the conduct appropriate for a Jew. |
| Exodus 22:27 | and blessing is stated above | Yevamot 101a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who exempts</b> the son from punishment? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Blessing is stated below</b> (Leviticus 20:9), with regard to cursing parents, <b>and blessing is stated above</b> (Exodus 22:27), with regard to cursing God. The Sages used the word blessing as a euphemism for cursing, as it was their custom to avoid uncouth language. <b>Just as</b> the statement <b>above,</b> in Exodus, is referring to a curse <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> as God is One, <b>so too</b> the statement <b>below,</b> in Leviticus, is referring exclusively to a curse of a parent <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> i.e., when there is no doubt with regard to his identity. <b>And striking is juxtaposed with cursing.</b> Just as one is not liable for cursing when it is unclear who his father is, the same applies to striking. |
| Exodus 22:27 | “You shall not curse a ruler of your people” | Yevamot 22b:7 | It states in the mishna that a child who is a <i>mamzer</i> <b>is liable</b> to receive punishment <b>if he strikes</b> his father or curses him. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> should he be liable? <b>Read here</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), which is interpreted to imply that the prohibition against cursing applies only <b>to one who acts according to the deeds of your people.</b> However, this father must have engaged in sexual relations with a woman who was forbidden to him in order to have a child who is a <i>mamzer</i>. Therefore, he did not act according to the deeds of the people. In that case, why should this son be liable to receive punishment for hitting him or cursing him? |
| Exodus 22:28 | Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina? The verse states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses” | Temurah 4a:3 | § It was stated (3a): <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: Also one who</b> separates <b><i>teruma</i> prior to</b> the separation of <b>the first fruits</b> is liable to be flogged. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason for</b> the prohibition mentioned by <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina? The verse states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses”</b> (Exodus 22:28). When the verse states: <b>The fullness of the harvest, these are</b> the <b>first fruits;</b> and when the verse states: <b>“And the outflow of your presses,” this is <i>teruma</i>. And</b> the verse <b>says: “You shall not delay,”</b> i.e., do not delay the separation of the first fruits by separating <i>teruma</i> beforehand. |
| Exodus 22:28 | which the Merciful One states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses” | Temurah 5b:14 | The Gemara objects: But <b>isn’t there</b> the case of one who separated <b><i>teruma</i> prior to the</b> separation of the <b>first fruits,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses”</b> (Exodus 22:28)? The verse was expounded earlier (4b) as teaching that one must separate first fruits before separating <i>teruma</i>. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:6): If <b>one</b> separates <i>teruma</i> <b>prior</b> to the separation of the first fruits, <b>although he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done,</b> and produce has the status of <i>teruma</i>. This appears to refute the opinion of Rava. |
| Exodus 22:29 | the verse states: “So you shall do | Bekhorot 26b:13 | <b>Rather, Rava says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of both a firstborn sheep and a firstborn ox are juxtaposed with the <i>halakha</i> of a firstborn child, which teaches that both require at least thirty days. But since <b>the verse states: “So you shall do</b> with your oxen” (Exodus 22:29), <b>the verse adds an extra</b> act of <b>doing for you in</b> the case of <b>your oxen.</b> In other words, the verse requires that the owner take care of an ox for additional time before giving it to the priest. |
| Exodus 22:29 | the verse states: “So you shall do | Bekhorot 56a:2 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But this</b> verse, which juxtaposes the firstborn son to an animal, <b>is written with regard to</b> redemption of <b>a firstborn,</b> not with regard to animal tithe. The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “So you shall do</b> with your oxen, and with your sheep: Seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me” (Exodus 22:29). <b>If</b> this <b>is not</b> needed <b>for</b> the <b>matter of firstborn</b> animals, <b>which do not</b> require <b>any action</b> to sanctify them <b>as</b> the animal is already <b>consecrated when</b> it leaves <b>the womb, apply it to the matter of animal tithe,</b> where an animal is sanctified only when the owner counts it as the tenth animal. |
| Exodus 22:29 | you shall do” | Bekhorot 56a:9 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: I saw Rabbi Yoḥanan in a dream,</b> which is a sign that <b>I am saying a proper matter</b> in explaining his opinion. <b>The verse states:</b> “So <b>you shall do”</b> (Exodus 22:29); <b>the verse excludes</b> purchased animals from animal tithe only <b>at the time of doing,</b> i.e., from the time the animals are fit to be sacrificed in the Temple. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim raised an objection to Rabbi Elazar</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The exemption of <b>a purchased</b> animal <b>applies</b> even <b>to</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, i.e., before it is eight days old and fit to be sacrificed in the Temple. By the same token, the exemption should also apply to a fetus, despite the fact that it is not yet fit to be sacrificed. |
| Exodus 22:29 | “So shall you do with your ox and with your sheep; | Chullin 81a:3 | <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>The night</b> after the seventh day is fit <b>for consecration,</b> which is permitted at that time, while <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> is fit <b>for effecting acceptance,</b> and only then may it be sacrificed on the altar. The Gemara answers that <b>another verse is</b> also <b>written</b> that specifies this positive mitzva: <b>“So shall you do with your ox and with your sheep;</b> seven days shall it be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me” (Exodus 22:29). |
| Exodus 22:29 | “Its mother” | Niddah 40a:16 | The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> more <b>reasonable for</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a consecrated animal <b>from a firstborn</b> animal, rather than from the <i>halakha</i> of childbirth, <b>as</b> it is written with regard to a consecrated animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), and it is likewise written <b>with regard to</b> a firstborn animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Exodus 22:29). The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, he should derive</b> it <b>from human</b> births, <b>as</b> that would be a derivation of the <i>halakha</i> concerning consecrated animals that are <b>ordinary,</b> i.e., not firstborns, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning human births of children that are <b>ordinary,</b> and not firstborns. |
| Exodus 22:30 | states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field” | Bekhorot 10a:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is forbidden and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted, <b>as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where the verse mentions being holy just as the other verse did, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted. |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field” | Chullin 102b:11 | § The Gemara discusses the source of the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> even if it is not an entire limb. |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field” | Chullin 102b:12 | <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibitions of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and</b> of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living.</b> And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 22:30 | And it is stated below: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals in the field [ tereifa ]; | Chullin 115b:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals in the field [<i>tereifa</i>];</b> you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as below it is prohibited</b> to eat a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>so too here it is prohibited</b> to eat meat cooked in milk. |
| Exodus 22:30 | states elsewhere: “And you shall be holy people to Me; | Chullin 116a:7 | The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna,</b> which states that meat cooked in milk is prohibited for benefit, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> it is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as it is stated: “For you are a holy people</b> to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). And the verse <b>states elsewhere: “And you shall be holy people to Me;</b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). |
| Exodus 22:30 | from the fact that the Merciful One states you shall not eat that an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [ tereifa ], | Chullin 37a:8 | <b>Rather,</b> the fact that its meat is permitted is derived <b>from the fact that the Merciful One states you shall not eat that an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> as it is written: “And you shall not eat any animal that was mauled in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]” (Exodus 22:30). From here, one learns <b>by inference</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted. As, if it enters your mind</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is prohibited, now</b> that an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>that is not lacking</b> any limb <b>is prohibited,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> to state that <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> an animal that was mauled and lacking body parts, is prohibited? |
| Exodus 22:30 | “You shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals [ tereifa ] in the field” | Chullin 42a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Where is there an allusion in the Torah to</b> the prohibition of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> The Gemara interjects: <b>Where</b> is there an allusion? Doesn’t the Torah state explicitly: <b>“You shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30)? <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>Where is there an allusion in the Torah to</b> the principle <b>that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live? As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the last clause: This is the principle: Any</b> animal that was injured such <b>that</b> an animal in <b>a similar</b> condition <b>could not live</b> for an extended period is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>;</b> one learns <b>by inference that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live.</b> If so, <b>from where do we</b> derive this? |
| Exodus 22:30 | flesh that is torn of animals [ tereifa ] in the field” | Chullin 47b:6 | <b>Rav Kahana says:</b> If the lung has an appearance <b>like the liver,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it has an appearance <b>like flesh,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And your mnemonic</b> to remember that the latter is a <i>tereifa</i> is the verse: “You shall not eat any <b>flesh that is torn of animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). |
| Exodus 22:30 | as the verse states: “And flesh, in the field, a tereifa , you shall not eat” | Chullin 68a:4 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states: “And flesh, in the field, a <i>tereifa</i>, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). A <i>tereifa</i> is an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months; its consumption is prohibited even if it is ritually slaughtered. The Gemara interprets the verse as teaching a principle: <b>Once flesh</b> whose permitted status is dependent on being within a certain area, e.g., sacrificial meat within the Temple courtyard, <b>has gone outside of its boundary,</b> i.e., the area in which it is permitted, which the verse describes as being “in the field,” <b>it becomes</b> permanently <b>prohibited,</b> like a <i>tereifa</i>. Likewise, the permitted status of a fetus is dependent on its being within the womb when the mother animal is slaughtered. Accordingly, if any part of the fetus leaves the womb before the slaughter, it is rendered permanently prohibited. |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And flesh, in the field, a tereifa , you shall not eat” | Chullin 68b:11 | <b>Rav Yehuda said to Ulla: But Rav and Shmuel both say</b> the <b>limb itself is prohibited;</b> how can you say otherwise? Ulla <b>said to him: Who will give us</b> some <b>of the dust of</b> the graves of <b>Rav and Shmuel and we will fill our eyes</b> with it; such is the greatness of those Sages. <b>But</b> I follow the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Initially one would assume <b>all</b> flesh that is permitted due to being within a certain boundary, e.g., a fetus inside its mother’s womb, the flesh of offerings of the most sacred order within the Temple courtyard, and the flesh of offerings of lesser sanctity within Jerusalem, <b>was included</b> in the verse: <b>“And flesh, in the field, a <i>tereifa</i>, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). The verse is interpreted to teach that if such flesh leaves its boundaries it is rendered forbidden, even should it subsequently return. |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And flesh that is torn in the field, you shall not eat” | Chullin 73b:12 | § <b>Rav Yosef said: Take</b> the statement <b>that Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef</b> says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says, i.e., that the slaughter of an animal does not render a hanging limb as though it had already fallen off prior to the slaughter, <b>in your hand,</b> i.e., accept it as correct, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> this opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And flesh that is torn in the field, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). This serves <b>to include</b> the case of <b>the limb or the flesh that was</b> partially cut off but was still <b>hanging on a domesticated animal or on an undomesticated animal or on a bird, and one slaughtered</b> them; it is derived <b>that they are prohibited</b> as limbs severed from a living animal. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to the ruling of this <i>baraita</i>: |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And you shall be holy men to Me” | Kiddushin 57b:10 | The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it states there</b> with regard to the prohibition of an unslaughtered animal carcass: <b>“And you shall be holy men to Me”</b> (Exodus 22:30). Since both verses employ the term “holy” he derives: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an animal carcass, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as the Torah explicitly states that it may be sold to a gentile, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. |
| Exodus 22:30 | you shall cast it to the dogs” | Kiddushin 58a:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may not slaughter</b> a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if he did slaughter</b> it, <b>he may cast it before the dogs,</b> i.e., derive benefit from it. <b>The verse states:</b> “Therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; <b>you shall cast it to the dogs”</b> (Exodus 22:30), which teaches that although one is prohibited from eating the meat of a <i>tereifa</i>, one may derive benefit from it. The word “it” serves to emphasize and exclude: <b>You may cast it,</b> i.e., a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>to the dogs, but you may not cast non-sacred</b> animals <b>that have been slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> as it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them. |
| Exodus 22:30 | “And any flesh torn of animals in the field you shall not eat” | Makkot 18a:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him also be flogged for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>“And any flesh torn of animals in the field you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). From the term “in the field,” a general <i>halakha</i> is derived: <b>Once the flesh emerged outside its partition</b> and is in the field, e.g., sacrificial meat that was taken outside the Tabernacle curtains that demarcate the courtyard, there is a prohibition, and the flesh is <b>forbidden.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This matter,</b> the prohibition against eating sacrificial flesh outside the partition of the Temple courtyard, applies only in a case <b>where</b> the flesh <b>is fit</b> for consumption <b>inside</b> the courtyard. <b>Here,</b> in the case of a burnt-offering, <b>where</b> the flesh <b>is not fit</b> for consumption <b>inside</b> the courtyard <b>either,</b> as it is not permitted for anyone to partake of a burnt-offering, there is no specific prohibition that applies to a non-priest partaking of the flesh outside the courtyard. |
| Exodus 22:30 | and anyone who testifies a false testimony, it is fit to throw him to the dogs, as it is written: “To the dog you shall cast it” | Makkot 23a:5 | <b>And Rav Sheshet says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, and anyone who accepts malicious speech</b> as the truth, <b>and anyone who testifies a false testimony, it is fit to throw him to the dogs, as it is written: “To the dog you shall cast it”</b> (Exodus 22:30), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“You shall not accept [<i>lo tissa</i>] a false report;</b> do not join with the wicked to be a false witness” (Exodus 23:1). In addition to prohibitions against false testimony and against accepting malicious speech, Rav Sheshet <b>also reads into</b> the verse the meaning: <b>You shall not relate [<i>lo tassi</i>]</b> a false report. |
| Exodus 22:30 | states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [ tereifa ] in the field” | Menachot 101b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where being a holy people is also mentioned, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted.</b> |
| Exodus 22:30 | you shall cast it to the dogs” | Pesachim 118a:13 | <b>And Rav Sheshet</b> further <b>said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who speaks slander, and anyone who accepts</b> and believes the <b>slander</b> he hears, <b>and anyone who testifies falsely about another, it is fitting to throw him to the dogs, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field, <b>you shall cast it to the dogs”</b> (Exodus 22:30), <b>and afterward it is written: “You shall not utter [<i>tisa</i>] a false report;</b> put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness” (Exodus 23:1). Uttering rumors is here equated to delivering false testimony. Furthermore, <b>read into</b> the verse as though it stated: <b>Do not cause</b> a false report <b>to be accepted [<i>tasi</i>],</b> i.e., do not lead others to accept your false reports. |
| Exodus 22:30 | you shall cast it to the dogs” | Pesachim 21b:11 | <b>However, according to Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that the word “or” <b>comes to</b> teach that the <b>matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written, from where does he derive</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions</b> of eating <b>mentioned in the Torah that it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> as well? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it</b> from another verse. It is stated with regard to an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]: “And you shall be sacred men to Me, therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; <b>you shall cast it to the dogs”</b> (Exodus 22:30). |
| Exodus 22:30 | you shall cast it to the dog” | Pesachim 23b:11 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from where Rabbi Yehuda derives it,</b> i.e., <b>from</b> the verse: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; <b>you shall cast it to the dog”</b> (Exodus 22:30). Rabbi Yehuda expounded that one may throw it to a dog, but one may not throw any of the other prohibited items mentioned in the Torah to a dog. From this he infers that it is prohibited to derive benefit from leavened bread on Passover or from other similar items. |
| Exodus 22:30 | And it is stated there: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; | Pesachim 24b:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection. Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> that has been cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated there: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me;</b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]; you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat in milk, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it. |
| Exodus 22:30 | states: “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field” | Zevachim 82b:8 | The Gemara explains that one does not derive this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as the verse <b>states: “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). The apparently superfluous term “in the field” teaches a general <i>halakha</i>: <b>Once meat has left</b> and been removed <b>outside of its boundary,</b> i.e., the area in which it is permitted to consume it, it <b>has become prohibited.</b> |
| Exodus 23:1 | witness” | Bava Kamma72b:9 | The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <b>Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively</b> because it is <b>from that time when he testified</b> that <b>he is</b> considered <b>a wicked man, and the Torah said: “Do not put</b> your hand with <b>the wicked</b> to be an unrighteous <b>witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: Do not allow a wicked man to serve as a witness. |
| Exodus 23:1 | “You shall not accept [ lo tissa ] a false report; | Makkot 23a:5 | <b>And Rav Sheshet says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, and anyone who accepts malicious speech</b> as the truth, <b>and anyone who testifies a false testimony, it is fit to throw him to the dogs, as it is written: “To the dog you shall cast it”</b> (Exodus 22:30), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“You shall not accept [<i>lo tissa</i>] a false report;</b> do not join with the wicked to be a false witness” (Exodus 23:1). In addition to prohibitions against false testimony and against accepting malicious speech, Rav Sheshet <b>also reads into</b> the verse the meaning: <b>You shall not relate [<i>lo tassi</i>]</b> a false report. |
| Exodus 23:1 | and afterward it is written: “You shall not utter [ tisa ] a false report; | Pesachim 118a:13 | <b>And Rav Sheshet</b> further <b>said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who speaks slander, and anyone who accepts</b> and believes the <b>slander</b> he hears, <b>and anyone who testifies falsely about another, it is fitting to throw him to the dogs, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field, <b>you shall cast it to the dogs”</b> (Exodus 22:30), <b>and afterward it is written: “You shall not utter [<i>tisa</i>] a false report;</b> put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness” (Exodus 23:1).

| Exodus 23:1 | , | Sanhedrin 27a:10 | <b>Abaye says</b> he is <b>disqualified because he is wicked, and the Merciful One states: Do not put the wicked</b> in a position to serve as <b>a witness. And Rava says</b> that he is <b>fit</b> because for one to be disqualified from bearing witness <b>we require</b> him to be <b>a wicked person</b> guilty <b>of</b> specifically <b>a monetary transgression</b> [<b><i>deḥamas</i></b>]<b>,</b> e.g., robbery. This is because the verse: “Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous [<i>ḥamas</i>] witness” (Exodus 23:1) alludes to such a transgression. |
| Exodus 23:1 | a wicked man. And the Torah stated: “Do not put your hand with the wicked | Sanhedrin 27a:2 | The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <b>Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively</b> because it is <b>from that time when he testified</b> that <b>he is</b> considered <b>a wicked man. And the Torah stated: “Do not put your hand with the wicked</b> to be an unrighteous witness” (Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Do not</b> allow <b>a wicked man</b> to serve as <b>a witness.</b> |
| Exodus 23:1 | from here: From “you shall not bear [ tissa ] | Sanhedrin 7b:15 | <b>Rav Kahana says</b> the litigant’s responsibility may be derived <b>from here: From “you shall not bear [<i>tissa</i>]</b> a false report” (Exodus 23:1). Although conjugated in this manner the verb would seem to be addressed to the judges, commanding them not to lend credence to a false report, the term may also be read as: <b>You shall not deliver [<i>tassi</i>]</b> a false report, conjugated so that it addresses the litigants and the witnesses. |
| Exodus 23:1 | witness” | Sanhedrin 9b:8 | But if the one who was sodomized testified that the accused sodomized him <b>with his consent,</b> he is testifying that <b>he</b> himself is <b>wicked,</b> having been complicit in the forbidden act, <b>and the Torah said: “Do not put</b> your hand with <b>a wicked</b> person to be an unrighteous <b>witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1). Therefore, the testimony is rejected. <b>Rava says: A person is his own relative and</b> therefore may not testify about himself. Therefore, <b>a person cannot render himself wicked</b> by his own testimony. As a result, he is deemed credible with regard to the sodomizer, but not with regard to himself. He remains a valid witness to convict the sodomizer in combination with another. |
| Exodus 23:1 | “You shall not accept [ lo tissa ] | Shevuot 31a:12 | <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a litigant shall not explain</b> the rationale behind <b>his statements to the judge before the other litigant comes</b> to court? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.” Rav Kahana teaches</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> that which is written: <b>“You shall not accept [<i>lo tissa</i>]</b> a false report” (Exodus 23:1), which he interprets as though it is written: <b>You shall not cause</b> others [<i>lo tassi</i>] to accept a false report. |
| Exodus 23:1 | And the Torah said: “Put not your hand with the wicked to be a corrupt witness” | Yevamot 25a:13 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>Didn’t Rav Yosef say:</b> With regard to one who testified that <b>so-and-so sodomized me against my will,</b> then <b>he</b> who testified to being the victim of the sexual assault <b>and another</b> bystander witness can <b>combine</b> as a pair of witnesses in order <b>to put</b> the assailant <b>to death</b> for homosexual intercourse. But if he testified: I was <b>willingly</b> sodomized by so-and-so, then <b>he is wicked</b> by his own admission, since he willingly transgressed. <b>And the Torah said: “Put not your hand with the wicked to be a corrupt witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1). If one renders himself unfit as a witness by admitting to murder, how can his testimony be accepted to permit the wife to remarry? |
| Exodus 23:2 | the Torah was already given at Mount Sinai, we do not regard a Divine Voice, as You already wrote at Mount Sinai, in the Torah: “After a majority to incline” | Bava Metzia59b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and said:</b> It is written: <b>“It is not in heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:12). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the relevance of the phrase <b>“It is not in heaven”</b> in this context? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> Since <b>the Torah was already given at Mount Sinai, we do not regard a Divine Voice, as You already wrote at Mount Sinai, in the Torah: “After a majority to incline”</b> (Exodus 23:2). Since the majority of Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, the <i>halakha</i> is not ruled in accordance with his opinion. The Gemara relates: Years after, <b>Rabbi Natan encountered Elijah</b> the prophet and <b>said to him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do at that time,</b> when Rabbi Yehoshua issued his declaration? Elijah <b>said to him:</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>smiled and said: My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.</b> |
| Exodus 23:2 | “After the majority to incline” | Chullin 11a:2 | § After discussing the role of presumptive status in determining <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara discusses the role of the majority. <b>From where is this matter that the Sages stated: Follow the majority,</b> derived? The Gemara is surprised at the question: <b>From where do we</b> derive it? Obviously, it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly: <b>“After the majority to incline”</b> (Exodus 23:2). |
| Exodus 23:2 | to bring three more | Sanhedrin 17a:17 | § The mishna derives the <i>halakha</i> that there are twenty-three judges on a lesser Sanhedrin from the verses: “And the congregation shall judge,” and: “And the congregation shall save” (Numbers 35:24–25). The mishna understands that the term “congregation” is referring to ten judges, so that the two congregations, one in each verse, total twenty judges. The mishna then asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to bring three more</b> judges to the court? The mishna answers: The implication of the verse: “You shall not follow a multitude to convict” (Exodus 23:2), is that your inclination after a majority to exonerate is not like your inclination after a majority to convict, and a conviction must be by a majority of two. |
| Exodus 23:2 | as it is written: “Do not answer in a cause [ riv ]” | Sanhedrin 18b:9 | § Having mentioned this <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara turns its attention to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: A king is not seated on the Sanhedrin, nor</b> is <b>a king or a High Priest</b> seated <b>on</b> a court for <b>intercalating the year.</b> The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a king on the Sanhedrin,</b> the source is <b>as it is written: “Do not answer in a cause [<i>riv</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:2), which is explained to mean: <b>Do not answer to a great person [<i>rav</i>].</b> Therefore, one whose stature will make the other judges afraid to contradict him may not be appointed to the Sanhedrin. |
| Exodus 23:2 | is stated: “You shall not follow a multitude to convict” | Sanhedrin 2a:16 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to bring three more</b> judges to the court? <b>From the implication of that</b> which <b>is stated: “You shall not follow a multitude to convict”</b> (Exodus 23:2), <b>I</b> would <b>derive that</b> I may not convict a person on the basis of a majority but <b>I should follow</b> the majority <b>to exonerate. If so, why is it stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“To incline after a multitude,”</b> from which it can be understood that the majority is followed in all cases? In order to resolve the apparent contradiction it must be explained: <b>Your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to exonerate is not like your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to convict. Your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to exonerate</b> can result in a verdict <b>by</b> a majority of <b>one</b> judge. But <b>your inclination</b> after the majority <b>to convict</b> a transgressor must be <b>by</b> a more decisive majority of at least <b>two.</b> Therefore, the court must have at least twenty-two judges. |
| Exodus 23:2 | Rav Aḥa bar Pappa says: The verse states: “Neither shall you answer in a cause [ al riv ]” | Sanhedrin 36a:14 | § The mishna teaches that in cases of <b>capital law,</b> the judges <b>commence</b> issuing their opinions <b>from the side</b> benches, where the least significant judges sit. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pappa says: The verse states: “Neither shall you answer in a cause [<i>al riv</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:2), and the Sages interpret: <b>Neither shall you answer after</b> the <b>Master [<i>al rav</i>],</b> i.e., do not dispute the opinion of the greatest among the judges. Therefore, were the judges to commence issuing their opinions from the greatest of them, and he would say that the accused is liable, no judge would acquit him. |
| Exodus 23:2 | the verse states: “To incline after a multitude to pervert justice” | Sanhedrin 3b:6 | <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoshiya accept</b> the principle that <b>a court</b> must be composed of <b>an odd</b> number of judges? <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “To incline after a multitude to pervert justice”</b> (Exodus 23:2)? The meaning is that <b>the Torah is saying</b> to you: <b>Make for yourself a court</b> that is composed of an odd number of judges, that will perforce <b>incline</b> in one direction, so that there will always be a majority that can be followed. |
| Exodus 23:3 | but isn’t it written: “Neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause” | Chullin 134a:14 | <b>If we say</b> that it means that one should do justice <b>in judgments,</b> i.e., a judge should sway judgments in favor of the afflicted and destitute, <b>but isn’t it written: “Neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause”</b> (Exodus 23:3)? <b>Rather,</b> the verse is teaching that in cases of uncertainty with regard to gifts left for the poor, <b>be righteous with that which is yours and give it to</b> the poor. Why, then, is the <i>halakha</i> stringent in the case of gifts left for the poor but lenient with regard to gifts to priests? |
| Exodus 23:4 | verse states: “If you encounter | Bava Metzia33a:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“If you see</b> the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden…you shall release it with him” (Exodus 23:5). I <b>might</b> have thought one is obligated <b>even</b> if he sees the animal <b>from a distance;</b> therefore <b>the</b> previous <b>verse states: “If you encounter</b> your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall return it to him” (Exodus 23:4). <b>If</b> the Torah had written only: <b>“If you encounter,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one is obligated to unload the burden only if there was <b>an actual encounter;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “If you see.” And what is seeing in which there is</b> an element of <b>encounter? The Sages calculated</b> it as <b>one of seven and a half</b> portions, i.e., two-fifteenths, <b>of a <i>mil</i>, and that is</b> the measure of <b>a <i>ris</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 23:5 | you shall release it [ azov ta’azov ] with him” | Bava Metzia31a:19 | § The Gemara cites additional derivations from compound verb forms. “If you see the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden, you shall forgo passing him by; <b>you shall release it [<i>azov ta’azov</i>] with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is obligated to help unload the fallen animal in a case where <b>its owner is with it. From where</b> is the obligation to unload it in a case <b>where its owner is not with it</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Azov ta’azov</i>,”</b> indicating that there is an obligation to unload it <b>in any case.</b> |
| Exodus 23:5 | unloading, with regard to which it is written: “You shall release it with him” | Bava Metzia32a:17 | § The mishna teaches: There is <b>a mitzva by Torah law to unload</b> a burden, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it? <b>If we say</b> that it means: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it <b>at all; what is different</b> about <b>unloading, with regard to which it is written: “You shall release it with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5)? With regard to <b>loading as well, isn’t it written: “You shall lift them with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4)? |
| Exodus 23:5 | defined? Here it is written: “Collapsed under its burden” | Bava Metzia32a:21 | <b>And the Rabbis</b> could ask: <b>Why</b> does Rabbi Shimon say that <b>the verses are not</b> clearly <b>defined? Here it is written: “Collapsed under its burden”</b> (Exodus 23:5), clearly referring to the case of a burden that needs unloading, and <b>there it is written: “Fallen down by the way”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4), <b>indicating</b> that both the animals <b>and their burdens are</b> lying <b>on the way</b> and are in need of loading. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> explains that the verses are not defined because the phrase <b>“fallen down by the way”</b> could be understood as <b>indicating</b> that the animals are fallen <b>with their burdens upon them,</b> and referring to unloading. |
| Exodus 23:5 | you shall release it [ azov ta’azov ] | Bava Metzia32a:6 | If <b>one unloaded</b> a burden from an animal collapsing under its weight <b>and</b> then later <b>loaded</b> it onto the animal, and later <b>unloaded and loaded</b> it again, <b>even</b> if this scenario repeats itself <b>four or five times,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to continue unloading and loading, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If you see the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden, you shall forgo passing him by; <b>you shall release it [<i>azov ta’azov</i>]</b> with him” (Exodus 23:5). It is derived from the verse that one is obligated to perform the action as needed, even several times. |
| Exodus 23:5 | you shall forgo | Bava Metzia32b:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If one encounters <b>the animal of a gentile</b> collapsed under <b>the burden of a Jew,</b> he may refuse to unload the burden, as it is written: “If you see the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden, <b>you shall forgo</b> passing him by; you shall release it with him” (Exodus 23:5). By employing the phrase “you shall forgo,” the verse indicates that there are circumstances in which one may forgo unloading the animal. The Gemara reasons: And <b>if you say</b> that the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law, why</b> is there the option of: <b>“You shall forgo”?</b> The Torah <b>should have</b> commanded only: <b>“You shall release it</b> with him.” The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> say that the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law,</b> and <b>there</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of loading,</b> where suffering of animals is not a factor. |
| Exodus 23:5 | burden, one need not attend to it, as it is stated: “Under its burden” | Bava Metzia32b:4 | The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Know that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: If there was</b> a burden <b>upon</b> the animal <b>greater than</b> its typical <b>burden, one need not attend to it, as it is stated: “Under its burden”</b> (Exodus 23:5). Rabbi Yosei holds that the obligation to unload an animal is with regard to <b>a burden that</b> the animal <b>can bear;</b> does this <b>not</b> indicate <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>he must attend to it</b> to unload a burden that is greater than its typical burden? <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling; is it <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law?</b> |
| Exodus 23:5 | with him” | Bava Metzia32b:6 | The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Know that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>not by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in <b>the former clause</b> of the mishna: If the owner <b>went, and sat, and said</b> to a passerby: <b>Since</b> there is <b>a mitzva</b> incumbent <b>upon you to unload</b> the burden, <b>unload</b> it, the passerby is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “You shall release it <b>with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5). <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals</b> is <b>by Torah law, what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if <b>its owner is</b> working <b>with</b> the passerby <b>and what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if <b>its owner is not</b> working <b>with</b> the passerby? The animal suffers in both cases. |
| Exodus 23:5 | “If you see | Bava Metzia33a:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“If you see</b> the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden…you shall release it with him” (Exodus 23:5). I <b>might</b> have thought one is obligated <b>even</b> if he sees the animal <b>from a distance;</b> therefore <b>the</b> previous <b>verse states: “If you encounter</b> your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall return it to him” (Exodus 23:4). <b>If</b> the Torah had written only: <b>“If you encounter,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one is obligated to unload the burden only if there was <b>an actual encounter;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “If you see.” And what is seeing in which there is</b> an element of <b>encounter? The Sages calculated</b> it as <b>one of seven and a half</b> portions, i.e., two-fifteenths, <b>of a <i>mil</i>, and that is</b> the measure of <b>a <i>ris</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 23:5 | permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “If you see the donkey of he who hates you lying under its load” | Pesachim 113b:4 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Although one who sees another committing a sin should not testify against him by himself, <b>he is</b> nonetheless <b>permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “If you see the donkey of he who hates you lying under its load”</b> (Exodus 23:5). The Gemara clarifies this verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of he <b>who hates you</b> mentioned in the verse? <b>If you say</b> it is referring to <b>a gentile who hates</b> you, <b>but wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase: <b>He who hates, of</b> which the Torah <b>spoke, is a Jew who hates</b> you, <b>not a gentile who hates</b> you? |
| Exodus 23:6 | Rav Aḥa bar Pappa says: As the verse states: “You shall not incline the judgment of your poor in his cause” | Sanhedrin 36b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pappa says: As the verse states: “You shall not incline the judgment of your poor in his cause”</b> (Exodus 23:6). He explains: <b>You may not incline the judgment of,</b> i.e., exert effort to find liable, <b>your poor, but you may incline the judgment of an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned.</b> The reason for the procedural differences between cases of monetary law and cases of capital law is to render it more likely that one accused of a capital transgression will be acquitted. This is not a factor when judging the ox. |
| Exodus 23:7 | to her: A fair and attractive bride? But the Torah states: “Keep you from a false matter” | Ketubot 17a:1 | One recites praise of <b>the bride as she is,</b> emphasizing her good qualities. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One recites: <b>A fair and attractive bride. Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the bride <b>was lame or blind,</b> does <b>one say</b> with regard <b>to her: A fair and attractive bride? But the Torah states: “Keep you from a false matter”</b> (Exodus 23:7). <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai:</b> According <b>to your statement,</b> with regard to <b>one who acquired an inferior acquisition from the market,</b> should another <b>praise it</b> and enhance its value <b>in his eyes or condemn it</b> and diminish its value <b>in his eyes? You must say</b> that <b>he should praise it</b> and enhance its value <b>in his eyes</b> and refrain from causing him anguish. <b>From here the Sages said: A person’s disposition should always be empathetic with mankind,</b> and treat everyone courteously. In this case too, once the groom has married his bride, one praises her as being fair and attractive. |
| Exodus 23:7 | capital law, | Sanhedrin 33b:5 | § The mishna teaches that in cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court brings the accused back to be judged again with a claim to acquit him, but does not bring him back to be judged with a claim to find him liable. To explain the terms “innocent” and “righteous” in the verse: “And the innocent and the righteous you shall not slay” (Exodus 23:7), <b>the Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to one who is <b>leaving the court</b> having been found <b>liable, and someone said: I have</b> the ability <b>to teach</b> a reason to <b>acquit him, from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the court <b>brings</b> the accused <b>back</b> to be judged again? <b>The verse states: The innocent you shall not slay,</b> and the accused may in fact be innocent. |
| Exodus 23:7 | isn’t it written: “And the innocent [ naki ] and righteous you shall not slay” | Sanhedrin 43a:23 | Then <b>they brought Nakai in</b> to stand trial. Nakai <b>said</b> to the judges: <b>Shall Nakai be executed?</b> But <b>isn’t it written: “And the innocent [<i>naki</i>] and righteous you shall not slay”</b> (Exodus 23:7)? <b>They said to him: Yes, Nakai shall be executed, as it is written: “In secret places he kills the innocent [<i>naki</i>]”</b> (Psalms 10:8). |
| Exodus 23:7 | the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter” | Shevuot 30b:13 | <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a judge should not engage in advocacy [<i>saneigeron</i>] for his</b> own <b>statements</b> and devise various pretexts to justify his erroneous rulings? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter”</b> (Exodus 23:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a judge that a student</b> who is <b>an ignoramus should not sit before him</b> to discuss the proceedings? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b> When an ignorant student engages in the proceedings, he is apt to cause the judge to err in judgment. |
| Exodus 23:7 | as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter” | Shevuot 31a:5 | <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a student whose teacher said to him: You know concerning me that</b> even <b>if</b> one were to <b>give me one hundred</b> times <b>one hundred dinars, I would not fabricate</b> a claim. Now, <b>I have one hundred dinars in the possession of so-and-so,</b> to whom I lent money, <b>but I have only one witness</b> of the two required to testify <b>about</b> the loan and enable me to collect payment; <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the student <b>shall not join with</b> the other witness and testify? It is derived <b>as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter”</b> (Exodus 23:7). |
| Exodus 23:8 | “And you shall take no bribe” | Ketubot 105a:10 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall take no bribe”</b> (Exodus 23:8); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>If</b> it comes <b>to teach that</b> one should <b>not acquit the guilty and</b> one should <b>not convict the innocent</b> due to a bribe, <b>it is already stated: “You shall not wrest judgment”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:19). <b>Rather,</b> this verse teaches that <b>even</b> if the purpose of the bribe is <b>to</b> ensure that one <b>acquit the innocent and convict the guilty, the Torah</b> nevertheless <b>says: “And you shall take no bribe.”</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for a judge to receive anything from the litigants, even if there is no concern at all that justice will be perverted. |
| Exodus 23:8 | blind their eyes, as it is stated: “For a bribe blinds those who have sight” | Ketubot 105a:15 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Come and see how blind are the eyes of those who accept bribes,</b> and how they ruin themselves. If <b>a person has pain in his eyes,</b> he <b>gives a doctor money,</b> and even then <b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>he will be healed</b> or <b>whether he will not be healed. And</b> yet those judges <b>take</b> the <b>value</b> of <b>a <i>peruta</i>,</b> a small amount of money as a bribe, <b>and</b> actively <b>blind their eyes, as it is stated: “For a bribe blinds those who have sight”</b> (Exodus 23:8). |
| Exodus 23:8 | But how could he do so? Isn’t it written: “And you shall take no bribe” | Ketubot 105a:8 | The Gemara relates: The Sage <b>Karna would take an <i>istera</i>,</b> a small coin, <b>from the innocent party, and an <i>istera</i> from the guilty party,</b> i.e., he would charge both parties that came to him for judgment, <b>and</b> then <b>he would judge their case.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But how could he do so? Isn’t it written: “And you shall take no bribe”</b> (Exodus 23:8), which indicates that a judge may not take money from either of the two litigants? |
| Exodus 23:8 | The Sages taught: “And you shall take no bribe” | Ketubot 105b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught: “And you shall take no bribe”</b> (Exodus 23:8). <b>It is not necessary to say</b> that this includes <b>bribery</b> by means of <b>money; however, even verbal bribery,</b> assisting by means of speech, <b>is also prohibited.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a bribe is not necessarily monetary is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And you shall take no profit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of bribing with words?</b> |
| Exodus 23:9 | “And you shall not oppress a convert | Bava Metzia59b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to verbal <b>mistreatment, that three prohibitions are written</b> concerning it: <b>“And you shall neither mistreat a convert”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And when a convert lives in your land, you shall not mistreat him”</b> (Leviticus 19:33); <b>“And you shall not mistreat, each man his colleague”</b> (Leviticus 25:17), <b>and a convert is</b> included in the category of <b>colleague?</b> With regard to <b>one who also oppresses</b> a convert <b>as well, three</b> prohibitions <b>are written:</b> “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, <b>nor oppress him”</b> (Exodus 22:20); <b>“And you shall not oppress a convert</b> (Exodus 23:9); <b>“And you shall not be to him like a creditor”</b> (Exodus 22:24). This last prohibition is a general prohibition, <b>in which converts are included.</b> Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. <b>Rather, both this</b> one, who verbally mistreats a convert, <b>and that</b> one, who oppresses him, <b>violate three prohibitions.</b> |
| Exodus 23:11 | perforce. When it is written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow [ untashtah ]” | Bava Metzia39a:1 | The Gemara explains: <b>Abandoned</b> property <b>[<i>netushim</i>];</b> this is referring to property that the owners vacated <b>perforce. When it is written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow [<i>untashtah</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:11), that is <b>expropriation by</b> edict of <b>the King</b> of the Universe. <b>Forsaken</b> property <b>[<i>retushim</i>];</b> this is referring to property that the owners vacated <b>of their</b> own <b>volition, as it is written: “A mother was forsaken [<i>rutasha</i>] with her sons”</b> (Hosea 10:14), indicating that the mother was left with the sons, as all the men left. |
| Exodus 23:11 | permitted during the Sabbatical Year? Isn’t it written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow” | Moed Katan3a:10 | Incidental to this discussion, the Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> light <b>hoeing</b> under olive trees in fact <b>permitted during the Sabbatical Year? Isn’t it written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow”</b> (Exodus 23:11), and it is taught with regard to this verse: <b>“You shall let it rest” from light hoeing, “and lie fallow” from clearing</b> the field of <b>stones.</b> This indicates that light hoeing is indeed prohibited during the Sabbatical Year. |
| Exodus 23:11 | “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow” | Sukkah 44b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is hoeing</b> olive groves <b>permitted</b> during the Sabbatical Year? <b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow”</b> (Exodus 23:11); meaning <b>you shall let it rest from hoeing, and lie fallow from clearing</b> the field of <b>rocks?</b> Apparently, hoeing is prohibited during the Sabbatical Year. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: There are two</b> types of <b>hoeing, one</b> whose objective is <b>to seal cracks</b> in the ground <b>and one to enhance the trees’ health. Enhancing the trees’ health is prohibited; sealing cracks is permitted,</b> as it is merely to prevent the trees from dying and not to accelerate their growth. |
| Exodus 23:12 | “And the son of your maidservant will be refreshed” | Yevamot 48b:4 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may maintain slaves that are not circumcised</b> under one’s control; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: One may not maintain</b> such slaves, even for a moment. <b>Rabbi Yishmael said to him: But it says</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“And the son of your maidservant will be refreshed”</b> (Exodus 23:12). The verse prohibits a Jewish master from allowing his slave to perform labor on Shabbat. The Gemara will explain that this is referring to an uncircumcised slave. It is therefore apparent that it is permitted to keep such a slave. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: The verse speaks of one who purchases a slave at twilight</b> on the eve of Shabbat <b>and</b> therefore <b>does not have the opportunity to circumcise him</b> before the onset of Shabbat. |
| Exodus 23:12 | “And the stranger [ ger ]” | Yevamot 48b:6 | The verse continues: <b>“And the stranger [<i>ger</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:12). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>a gentile who observes certain mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>].</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>this is a <i>ger toshav</i>, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only a righteous convert [<i>ger tzedek</i>],</b> who is a Jew in every sense? <b>When it says</b> elsewhere: <b>“And your stranger [<i>ger</i>] that is within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:13), <b>a righteous convert is</b> already <b>mentioned. How,</b> then, <b>do I uphold</b> the verse <b>“And the stranger [<i>ger</i>]”?</b> It must be that <b>this is a <i>ger toshav</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 23:13 | idol worship; and the Torah states: “Neither let it be heard out of your mouth” | Bekhorot 2b:19 | The Gemara responds: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> with regard to that which the mishna states: <b>One who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile, <b>where it</b> also <b>does not teach:</b> Although he is not permitted to do so, <b>so too,</b> should it be derived <b>that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to enter into such a partnership? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel’s father say: It is prohibited for a person to enter</b> into <b>a partnership with a gentile lest</b> their joint ventures lead them to quarrel and his gentile partner <b>will be obligated to take an oath to him and he will take an oath in the name of his</b> object of <b>idol worship; and the Torah states: “Neither let it be heard out of your mouth”</b> (Exodus 23:13), which includes causing a gentile to take an oath in the name of an idol. |
| Exodus 23:13 | and it is written there: “And make no mention of the name of the other gods” | Sanhedrin 109a:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: All of</b> those factions <b>intended</b> to build the tower <b>for the sake of idol worship. It is written here: “And let us make a name for us”</b> (Genesis 11:4), <b>and it is written there: “And make no mention of the name of the other gods”</b> (Exodus 23:13). <b>Just as there,</b> the connotation of “name” <b>is idol worship, so too here,</b> the connotation of “name” <b>is idol worship.</b> |
| Exodus 23:13 | “And make no mention of the name of the other gods, | Sanhedrin 63b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the meaning of the verse: <b>“And make no mention of the name of the other gods,</b> neither let it be heard out of your mouth” (Exodus 23:13), is <b>that a person may not say to another: Wait for me next to such and such</b> an object of <b>idol worship.</b> The meaning of the statement <b>“neither let it be heard out of your mouth”</b> is <b>that</b> one <b>may not vow in</b> the <b>name of</b> an idol, <b>nor affirm</b> his statement by an oath <b>in its name, nor cause others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>to vow in its name or affirm</b> their statements by an oath <b>in its name.</b> |
| Exodus 23:13 | “And in all that I said to you, take heed” | Shabbat 18a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>baraita</i> prohibited a mill and permitted other prohibited labor? <b>Rabba said: Because it makes noise</b> and the public will hear the mill grinding on Shabbat. Although no prohibited labor is being performed, doing so displays contempt for Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages prohibited it. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: <b>And let the Master say</b> a better reason, <b>due to the</b> obligation to ensure the <b>resting of utensils.</b> Even the utensils of a Jewish person may not be used for prohibited labor on Shabbat. <b>As it was taught</b> in halakhic midrash, the <i>Mekhilta</i>: That which is stated: <b>“And in all that I said to you, take heed”</b> (Exodus 23:13), is an allusion to matters mentioned in the Oral Torah. It comes <b>to include the resting of utensils</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The reason for the prohibition of the mill on Shabbat is <b>due to the resting of utensils.</b> |
| Exodus 23:14 | times [ regalim ] | Arakhin 19b:8 | It is further taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above: His <b>leg [<i>regel</i>] until the knee,</b> which indicates that the term <i>regel</i> is defined as the foot until the knee. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It is written in the Torah with regard to the obligation to ascend to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festivals: “Three <b>times [<i>regalim</i>]</b> you shall keep a feast for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14). The term <i>regalim</i>, legs, serves to <b>exclude people with artificial legs [<i>ba’alei kabbayin</i>]</b> from this obligation. According to the <i>baraita</i>, one who has a stump in place of his foot is exempt from the pilgrimage. This indicates the term <i>regel</i> is referring to the foot, up to the ankle, not to the entire area below the knee. |
| Exodus 23:14 | from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is stated: “Three times [ regalim ]” | Chagigah 2a:2 | <b>Who</b> has the status of <b>a minor</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Any</b> child <b>who is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders and ascend from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: Any</b> child <b>who is unable to hold his father’s hand and ascend</b> on foot <b>from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is stated: “Three times [<i>regalim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:14). Since the term for feet is <i>raglayim</i>, Beit Hillel infer from here that the obligation to ascend involves the use of one’s legs. |
| Exodus 23:14 | times [ regalim ] | Chagigah 3a:11 | <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said: One who is lame in one leg is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three <b>times [<i>regalim</i>]</b> shall you keep a feast for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14).Since the term for feet is <i>raglayim</i>, it can be inferred from here that the obligation to ascend involves the use of both of one’s legs. |
| Exodus 23:14 | The Sages taught: “Times [ regalim ]” | Chagigah 4a:13 | The mishna further taught: <b>And the lame, and the blind, and the sick, and the old</b> are all exempt from the mitzva of appearance. <b>The Sages taught: “Times [<i>regalim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:14) alludes to the use of one’s feet [<i>raglayim</i>], and therefore it <b>excludes people with artificial legs.</b> Although they are able to walk, they are exempt from traveling, as they do not have feet. <b>Alternatively,</b> the term <b>“<i>regalim</i>”</b> comes to <b>exclude the lame, the sick, the blind, the old, and one who is unable to ascend on his</b> own <b>feet.</b> The Gemara asks: The last category of <b>one who is unable to ascend on his feet,</b> comes <b>to add what?</b> The <i>baraita</i> already taught that the lame and the sick are exempt. <b>Rava said:</b> It comes <b>to add</b> |
| Exodus 23:14 | Festivals [ regalim ] | Yevamot 103a:11 | It was taught in the mishna that if one’s leg was amputated <b>from the knee down</b> and his <i>yevama</i> performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with him, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that comments on the pilgrimage one makes to Jerusalem during a Festival. The Torah states: “Three <b>Festivals [<i>regalim</i>]</b> you shall celebrate for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14). The <i>baraita</i> comments on the verse: Festivals are referred to in the verse as <i>regalim</i>, which literally means feet, indicating that one must actually make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem by foot [<i>regel</i>] during the Festival, which comes to <b>exclude people who have prostheses.</b> This indicates that a prosthetic foot is not called a <i>regel</i>, which seems to contradict the mishna that allows <i>ḥalitza</i> on a prosthetic from the knee down. |
| Exodus 23:15 | the burnt offering of appearance, | Bekhorot 51b:8 | <b>Rav Dimi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> says: The verse states concerning the redemption of the firstborn: <b>“And every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty”</b> (Exodus 34:20). <b>And</b> therefore this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between <b>“empty”</b> and <b>“empty,” from</b> the passage discussing <b>the burnt offering of appearance,</b> which every pilgrim must bring on a Festival. With regard to the burnt offering of appearance it states: “And none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 23:15). <b>Just as</b> in the case of the <b>burnt offering of appearance one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for the loss of the offering, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>redemption of the firstborn one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for its loss as well. |
| Exodus 23:15 | As the Sages taught: “You shall observe the festival of Passover seven days” | Chagigah 18a:5 | The Gemara proceeds to ask: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived; what is the biblical source for this prohibition? <b>As the Sages taught: “You shall observe the festival of Passover seven days”</b> (Exodus 23:15). This <b>teaches that the performance of labor is prohibited during the intermediate Festival days,</b> as “observe” denotes a negative commandment; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiyya. Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary,</b> as it does not accord with the straightforward meaning of the verse. Rather, it is learned from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: <b>If the performance of labor</b> on the <b>first and seventh</b> days of Passover, <b>which are not preceded and followed by sanctity</b> as the days before the first day and after the seventh day are weekdays, <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited, is it not right that</b> on the days of <b>the intermediate Festival days, which are preceded and followed by sanctity,</b> i.e., the first and last days of the Festival, <b>the performance of labor should be prohibited?</b> |
| Exodus 23:15 | And they may not appear empty-handed, because it is stated: “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed” | Chagigah 7a:10 | Reish Lakish <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Three times a year the Jewish people were commanded to ascend on the pilgrimage Festival: On Passover, on <i>Shavuot</i>, and on <i>Sukkot</i>. They may not appear partially,</b> i.e., only some of the people, <b>because it is stated: “All your males”</b> (Exodus 23:17). <b>And they may not appear empty-handed, because it is stated: “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed”</b> (Exodus 23:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> That too is referring to <b>the main</b> day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival.</b> |
| Exodus 23:15 | matza | Kiddushin 34a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> this an established <b>principle?</b> But <b>there are</b> the mitzvot of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> on the first night of Passover (Exodus 23:15), of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival (Deuteronomy 16:9–11), and <b>assembly</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). <b>And</b> each of these is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are obligated</b> in them. <b>And furthermore,</b> one can raise a difficulty as follows: <b>But there are</b> the mitzvot of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7), <b>procreation</b> (Genesis 1:28), <b>and redemption of the firstborn</b> (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which <b>is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are exempt</b> from them. |
| Exodus 23:16 | “And the Festival of harvest” | Chagigah 18a:2 | <b>And Reish Lakish said,</b> providing a different proof: From the very name of the day: <b>“And the Festival of harvest”</b> (Exodus 23:16), we can learn the following: <b>On which Festival do you celebrate and harvest? You must say it is <i>Shavuot</i>. When</b> exactly does this apply? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>on the Festival day</b> itself, <b>is harvesting permitted on a Festival? Rather, is</b> it <b>not</b> referring to the day of <b>redress?</b> |
| Exodus 23:16 | “the Festival of gathering” | Chagigah 18a:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> to Reish Lakish: <b>However, if that is so,</b> you should likewise say with regard to <b>“the Festival of gathering”</b> (Exodus 23:16): On <b>which Festival is there gathering? You must say it is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. When</b> exactly? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>on the Festival day</b> itself, <b>is labor permitted on a Festival? Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to the intermediate Festival days.</b> But on <b>the intermediate Festival days,</b> too, <b>is it permitted?</b> One may perform only work that, if neglected, would result in irretrievable loss. <b>Rather,</b> you must explain that “the Festival of gathering” is referring to the season of the year, i.e., the <b>Festival that occurs during the time of gathering. Here too:</b> “The Festival of harvest” means <b>a Festival that occurs during the time of</b> harvest. |
| Exodus 23:16 | which you sow | Menachot 71a:6 | <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the source of the <i>halakha</i> is the verse: “And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, <b>which you sow</b> in the field” (Exodus 23:16). This verse is referring to grain <b>from the time of sowing,</b> i.e., from when the grain takes root. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: If so,</b> then <b>even though</b> the grain <b>had not taken root</b> it should be permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering. The verse mentions grain at the time of sowing, but it does not indicate that it is necessary for that grain to have taken root in order to be permitted by the <i>omer</i>. Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in reply: <b>Wise one [<i>sudni</i>]</b>! <b>It is written: “In the field,”</b> which indicates that the verse is referring to freshly sown produce that has become part of the field, i.e., it has taken root. |
| Exodus 23:16 | “And the festival of the harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you will sow in the field” | Menachot 84b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the two loaves <b>precede</b> the bringing of the <b>first fruits</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “And you shall make for yourself a festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, the first fruits of the wheat harvest”</b> (Exodus 34:22). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes the bringing of the first fruits of the wheat harvest. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the <b>first fruits of the wheat harvest. From where</b> do I derive that they also precede the bringing of the first fruits of <b>the barley harvest? The verse states</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“And the festival of the harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you will sow in the field”</b> (Exodus 23:16). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes all forms of first fruits that are sown in the field, which includes barley. |
| Exodus 23:16 | verse states: “In the field” | Menachot 84b:5 | From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the bringing of the first fruits <b>that</b> sprouted from seeds <b>you sowed,</b> as the verse states: “Which you will sow.” <b>From where</b> do I derive that they precede even the bringing of first fruits <b>that sprouted by themselves? The</b> continuation of that <b>verse states: “In the field”</b> (Exodus 23:16). The term is superfluous and serves to include even produce that sprouted by itself. |
| Exodus 23:16 | “The first fruits of your labors” | Menachot 84b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the offering of the two loaves <b>is to precede</b> both <b>the</b> bringing of <b>libations</b> from grapes of the new crop <b>and</b> the bringing of the first <b>fruits of the tree? It is stated here,</b> with regard to the two loaves: <b>“The first fruits of your labors”</b> (Exodus 23:16), <b>and it is stated there</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“When you gather in the products of your labors from the field.” Just as there,</b> the term “your labors” is referring both to fruits used for <b>the libations and the fruit of the tree, so too, here,</b> the term is referring to both fruits used for <b>the libations and the fruit of the tree.</b> |
| Exodus 23:16 | as it is written: “And the festival of gathering, which is at the end of the year, | Rosh Hashanah13a:2 | The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And the festival of gathering, which is at the end of the year,</b> when you have gathered in your labors out of the field” (Exodus 23:16). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“gathering”? If we say</b> that it means: <b>A Festival that comes at the time of gathering</b> the crops, <b>isn’t it</b> already <b>written: “When you have gathered</b> in your labors”? There is no need to repeat this a second time. |
| Exodus 23:16 | It is written: “The Festival of Ingathering” | Sanhedrin 13b:4 | <b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> it can be explained that <b><i>Aḥerim</i> are standing in</b> the season of <b>Tishrei, and</b> were discussing <i>Sukkot</i> as opposed to Passover. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> hold</b> that <b>we require all of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, including <b>the Festival</b> on the <b>first</b> day, to take place in the new season. Since <i>Sukkot</i> begins on the fifteenth of Tishrei, the equinox must fall no later than the fourteenth. The Gemara asks: How is it possible to say that <b>the Festival</b> on the <b>first</b> day must also be in the new season? <b>It is written: “The Festival of Ingathering”</b> (Exodus 23:16), which is referring to the time when the crops are gathered. This can refer only to the intermediate days of <i>Sukkot</i>, since it is prohibited to gather crops on a Festival. The Gemara answers: They interpret the verse to mean: <b>The Festival that comes at the time of ingathering,</b> meaning in the autumn. |
| Exodus 23:17 | appearance, as it is stated: | Arakhin 2b:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> This is one possible explanation for what is added by the general statement of the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a, according to Ravina. |
| Exodus 23:17 | will appear [ yera’e ] | Chagigah 2a:6 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dehavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three occasions in the year all your males <b>will appear [<i>yera’e</i>]</b> before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). Since there are no vowels in the text, this can be read as: All your males <b>will see [<i>yireh</i>]</b> the Lord God. This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to be seen: Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both one’s eyes, so too</b> the obligation <b>to be seen</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> Therefore, one who is blind in one eye is not obligated in the mitzva of appearance in the Temple. |
| Exodus 23:17 | occasions [ pe’amim ] | Chagigah 3a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the term <b>“<i>regalim</i>” is necessary</b> to <b>exclude people with artificial legs.</b> Although these people are capable of walking, as they do not have two natural legs they are exempt from ascending to the Temple. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from:</b> “Three <b>occasions [<i>pe’amim</i>]</b> in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). The term <i>pe’amim</i> can also mean legs, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the term <b>“<i>pe’amim</i>”: <i>Pe’amim</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>legs. And so it says: “The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps [<i>pa’amei</i>] of the needy”</b> (Isaiah 26:6), <b>and it says: “How beautiful are your feet [<i>fe’amayikh</i>] in sandals, daughter of the prince”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2). |
| Exodus 23:17 | the verse states: “Before the Lord God” | Chagigah 4a:10 | § The mishna taught that <b>women and slaves who are not emancipated</b> are exempt from the mitzva of appearance. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, women</b> are exempt, <b>as we said</b> earlier that this is derived from the phrase: “Your males.” <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>slaves, from where do we</b> derive that they are exempt? <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Before the Lord God”</b> (Exodus 23:17). This indicates that <b>one who has only one Master</b> is obligated, which <b>excludes this</b> slave, <b>who has another master.</b> |
| Exodus 23:17 | The Sages taught, | Chagigah 4a:3 | § The mishna taught: <b>And a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite</b> are exempt from the mitzva of appearance in the Temple. <b>The Sages taught,</b> with regard to the verse: “Three occasions in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17), had the verse simply said <b>“males,”</b> this would serve <b>to exclude women</b> from this mitzva. By specifying <b>“your males,”</b> it comes <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite</b> as well. Furthermore, when the verse adds <b>“all your males,”</b> this serves <b>to include</b> male <b>minors.</b> |
| Exodus 23:17 | shall appear [ yera’e ] | Chagigah 4b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dehavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: One who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three times a year all your males <b>shall appear [<i>yera’e</i>]</b> before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). Since there are no vowels in the text, this can be read as: All your males <b>will see [<i>yireh</i>]</b> the Lord God. This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to be seen: Just as one comes to see with both his eyes, so too</b> the obligation <b>to be seen</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with both his eyes.</b> Therefore, one who is blind in one eye is exempt from the mitzva of appearance in the Temple. |
| Exodus 23:17 | because it is stated: “All your males” | Chagigah 7a:10 | Reish Lakish <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Three times a year the Jewish people were commanded to ascend on the pilgrimage Festival: On Passover, on <i>Shavuot</i>, and on <i>Sukkot</i>. They may not appear partially,</b> i.e., only some of the people, <b>because it is stated: “All your males”</b> (Exodus 23:17). <b>And they may not appear empty-handed, because it is stated: “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed”</b> (Exodus 23:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> That too is referring to <b>the main</b> day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival.</b> |
| Exodus 23:17 | may not appear partially, | Chagigah 7a:17 | § Earlier the <i>baraita</i> taught: The people <b>may not appear partially,</b> as the verse states: “All your males” (Exodus 23:17). <b>Rav Yosef thought to say: One who has ten sons</b> should <b>not let five ascend now and</b> the other <b>five tomorrow.</b> Rather, they must all ascend to the Temple together. |
| Exodus 23:17 | your males | Kiddushin 34b:2 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to bring a burnt-offering on pilgrimage Festivals, <b>which is a positive, time-bound mitzva. And the reason</b> women are exempt from this obligation is <b>that the Merciful One writes,</b> with regard to this mitzva: “Three times in the year all of <b>your males</b> shall appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17), which serves <b>to exclude women.</b> It may be derived from here that <b>if that were not so, women</b> would be <b>obligated.</b> This indicates that women are not necessarily exempt from every positive, time-bound mitzva. |
| Exodus 23:17 | as it is stated: | Sanhedrin 4b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the words: <b>“Shall see”</b> and <b>“shall appear” are</b> written in <b>an identical</b> matter, <b>and</b> nevertheless the Sages <b>disagree</b> about which reading is authoritative. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima: One who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear in the Temple and to sacrifice an offering on the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> |
| Exodus 23:18 | cannot enter your mind, as it is written: “The fat of My Festival feast [ ḥagi ] shall not remain all night until the morning” | Chagigah 10b:4 | The Gemara raises a difficulty. But <b>perhaps this is what the Merciful One said:</b> Slaughter animals so that you can <b>eat, drink, and celebrate a Festival before Me,</b> but no offerings are necessary. The Gemara answers: This <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is written: “The fat of My Festival feast [<i>ḥagi</i>] shall not remain all night until the morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18). <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that it is</b> referring to a regular <b>Festival feast</b> and not an offering, <b>does a Festival feast have</b> forbidden <b>fats?</b> |
| Exodus 23:18 | Rav Idi bar Avin raises an objection | Chullin 30a:3 | <b>Rav Idi bar Avin raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 63a) to the opinion that halakhic slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion. If one slaughters an animal for the sake of the Paschal offering on the fourteenth of Nisan after noon while he has leaven in his possession, he is flogged for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread” (Exodus 23:18). If he slaughtered the animal not for the sake of the Paschal offering, he is exempt from receiving lashes. <b>And</b> if he slaughtered the animal <b>during the festival</b> of Passover <b>for</b> the <b>sake</b> of the Paschal offering with leaven in his possession, <b>he is exempt,</b> because it is a disqualified Paschal offering, as it was slaughtered beyond its appointed time. But if he slaughtered the animal during the Festival <b>not for</b> the <b>sake</b> of the Paschal offering, but rather as a peace offering, <b>he is liable</b> for slaughtering the animal with leaven in his possession. |
| Exodus 23:18 | “Neither may the fat of My festive-offering remain overnight until morning” | Pesachim 59b:6 | <b>Rav Kahana raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Neither may the fat of My festive-offering remain overnight until morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18), which indicates <b>that</b> the fat <b>may not remain overnight</b> and <b>into the morning</b> hours, <b>but it may remain all through the night.</b> However, in another verse <b>it is written: “And he shall burn upon it the fat of the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), and it is interpreted: <b>Upon it you shall complete all the offerings,</b> which indicates that the fats of all the offerings brought during the day must be burned before the daily afternoon offering. |
| Exodus 23:18 | As it is written: “My sacrifice [ zivḥi ],” “My sacrifice [ zivḥi ],” two times, | Pesachim 64a:6 | It was further stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: On the fourteenth</b> of Nisan one is liable for sacrificing <b>the Paschal lamb</b> with leaven in his possession, but he is not liable for sacrificing other offerings with leaven; however, during the Festival one is liable for sacrificing any offering with leaven in his possession. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “My sacrifice [<i>zivḥi</i>],” “My sacrifice [<i>zivḥi</i>],” two times,</b> as first it is written: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice [<i>zivḥi</i>] with leavened bread” (Exodus 23:18) and then it is written again: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice [<i>zivḥi</i>] with leavened bread” (Exodus 34:25). If the two instances of the word <i>zivḥi</i> are combined, their letters may be rearranged to <b>read: A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],</b> and: <b>My sacrifices [<i>zevaḥai</i>].</b> This indicates that the law applies both to the Paschal lamb and to the rest of the sacrifices. |
| Exodus 23:18 | neither shall the fat of my Festival offering be left over until morning” | Pesachim 71a:12 | <b>Rav Kahana said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the sacrificial parts of the Festival peace-offering of the fifteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., those portions of the offering that are consumed on the altar, <b>are disqualified when left overnight</b> on the first night after the offering is slaughtered, despite the fact that the meat of the offering may be consumed for an additional day? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall not offer the blood of My offering with leaven; <b>neither shall the fat of my Festival offering be left over until morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18), <b>and, juxtaposed with it</b> is the word <b>first,</b> in the verse: “The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God” (Exodus 23:19). This comes <b>to say</b> to us <b>that the morning</b> mentioned in the first verse is the <b>first morning</b> after the offering has been sacrificed. |
| Exodus 23:19 | in milk | Avodah Zarah74a:3 | <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> also applies to <b>birds</b> designated for the purification <b>of a leper</b> (Leviticus 14:1–6), <b>and the</b> shorn <b>hair of a nazirite</b> (Numbers 6:18), <b>and a firstborn donkey</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>and meat</b> that was cooked <b>in milk</b> (Exodus 23:19), <b>and the scapegoat</b> of Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:7–10), <b>and</b> the meat of <b>a non-sacred</b> animal <b>that was slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> All of <b>these</b> are <b>forbidden</b> themselves, <b>and any amount</b> of them <b>renders</b> a mixture <b>forbidden.</b> |
| Exodus 23:19 | your land | Bava Batra81a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “The choicest first fruits of <b>your land</b> you shall bring” (Exodus 23:19)? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> fruit bought by a Jew that was grown on the <b>land of a gentile</b> in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, <b>which You,</b> Lord, <b>have given me”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:10)? If he purchased the fruit, then the land on which it grew was not given to him by God. The Gemara answers that the phrase “which You have given me” can mean <b>that You have given me money, and with that</b> money <b>I bought</b> this fruit. |
| Exodus 23:19 | “them” | Menachot 57b:19 | The Gemara explains: The term <b>“them”</b> indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those offerings that come from leaven or honey and which are called: “An offering of first produce.” This category consists of first fruits, which are brought from dates and other sweet fruit and which are called: “The choicest first fruits of your land” (Exodus 23:19), and the two loaves, which are leaven and are the first meal offerings brought from the new crop each year. In other words, it is with regard to <b>this</b> category <b>that</b> the verse <b>amplifies for you</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>ramp</b> of the altar is considered <b>like</b> the <b>altar</b> itself. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>other items,</b> e.g., the meat of sin offerings and guilt offerings, the ramp of the altar is <b>not</b> treated like the altar itself. |
| Exodus 23:19 | first, | Pesachim 71a:12 | <b>Rav Kahana said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the sacrificial parts of the Festival peace-offering of the fifteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., those portions of the offering that are consumed on the altar, <b>are disqualified when left overnight</b> on the first night after the offering is slaughtered, despite the fact that the meat of the offering may be consumed for an additional day? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall not offer the blood of My offering with leaven; <b>neither shall the fat of my Festival offering be left over until morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18), <b>and, juxtaposed with it</b> is the word <b>first,</b> in the verse: “The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God” (Exodus 23:19). This comes <b>to say</b> to us <b>that the morning</b> mentioned in the first verse is the <b>first morning</b> after the offering has been sacrificed. |
| Exodus 23:19 | in its mother’s milk [ baḥalev ]” | Sanhedrin 4a:15 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s assertion that all of the above disputes are based on the question of whether the traditional consonantal text or the vocalized text of the Torah is authoritative: <b>Is there</b> a Sage <b>who does not accept</b> the principle that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat <b>in its mother’s milk [<i>baḥalev</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:19). One <b>might</b> have thought the verse should be read as prohibiting the cooking of the young goat <b>in the fat [<i>beḥelev</i>]</b> of the mother, and there is no prohibition against cooking the meat with milk. |
| Exodus 23:19 | the verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat” | Sanhedrin 4b:16 | It is therefore apparent that even when there is no difference in the way the words are written, some say that the tradition, not the vocalization, is authoritative. <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The reason all agree that there is a prohibition to cook a young goat in its mother’s milk and not in its mother’s fat is that <b>the verse states: “You shall not cook a young goat”</b> (Exodus 23:19). The verse teaches that the action <b>the Torah prohibited</b> is in <b>the manner of cooking,</b> which is generally done in a liquid such as milk and not in a solid substance such as fat. |
| Exodus 23:20 | “Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way” | Bava Kamma93a:1 | <b>“Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way”</b> (Exodus 23:20), indicating that an angel was sent in place of God to guard the Jewish people. |
| Exodus 23:25 | from here, | Bava Kamma92b:3 | Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The verse states: “And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you” (Exodus 23:25). Rava explicates: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God”; this</b> is referring to the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i> and prayer. “And He will bless your bread and your water”; this</b> is referring to <b>bread</b> dipped <b>in salt, and a flask of water</b> drunk after the bread, in the mornings. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> the remainder of the verse applies: <b>“And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.”</b> |
| Exodus 23:25 | “And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water” | Bava Metzia107b:11 | Rava <b>said to him: You said to me</b> that it is derived <b>from there, but I say to you</b> that it is derived <b>from here,</b> a different verse: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25), which he interprets as follows: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God,” this</b> refers to the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i> and</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> both of which constitute daily service of God. <b>“And He will bless your bread and your water,” this</b> refers to <b>bread with salt and a large jug of water</b> consumed after morning prayers. <b>From that</b> point <b>onward,</b> the rest of the verse: <b>“And I will take sickness away from your midst,”</b> will be fulfilled. |
| Exodus 23:25 | is not necessary, as it says: “And He will bless your bread and your water” | Berakhot 48b:7 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> That source for the obligation to recite a blessing beforehand <b>is not necessary, as it says: “And He will bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25); <b>do not read: And He will bless [<i>uveirakh</i>], rather: And you will bless [<i>uvareikh</i>]. And when is it called bread? Before it is eaten.</b> |
| Exodus 23:25 | blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your bread and your water” | Eruvin 65a:21 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanin bar Pappa said: Anyone in whose house wine does not flow like water is not</b> yet <b>included</b> in the Torah’s <b>blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25). The water mentioned in this verse actually refers to wine, as learned in the following manner: <b>Just as bread</b> is something <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> i.e., one is permitted to buy bread with money used to redeem second-tithe, <b>so</b> too the word <b>water</b> in the verse is referring to a liquid <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money. And what is that?</b> It is <b>wine,</b> as one may buy wine with second-tithe money, but one may not buy water; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the verse <b>calls it “water.”</b> |
| Exodus 23:26 | This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill” | Kiddushin 38a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>Moses was born on the seventh of Adar?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today,”</b> since Moses could have said simply: I am one hundred and twenty years old. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”?</b> One can learn from it that Moses was born on that date, i.e., he was exactly one hundred and twenty years old. <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26). |
| Exodus 23:26 | from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill” | Rosh Hashanah11a:12 | The Gemara continues: <b>The one who said</b> that <b>in Nisan</b> the Patriarchs <b>were born</b> also holds that <b>in Nisan they died. The one who says</b> that <b>in Tishrei they were born</b> also holds that <b>in Tishrei they died, as it is stated</b> about Moses on the day of his death: <b>“And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today,”</b> since it is clear that Moses was speaking on that day, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”?</b> It is to teach that Moses was speaking precisely, as if to say: <b>Today my days and years are</b> exactly <b>filled</b> and completed. This comes <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and fills the years of the righteous from day to day</b> and <b>from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26). Similarly, the Patriarchs merited that their years be fulfilled to the day, and so they died on the same date they were born. |
| Exodus 23:26 | to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is written: “The number of your days I will fill” | Sotah 13b:16 | The verse relates what Moses said to the Jewish people at the end of his life: <b>“And he said to them: I am a hundred and twenty years old this day;</b> I can no longer go out and come in; and the Lord has said to me: You shall not go over this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 31:2). The wording is problematic, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the term <b>“this day.”</b> Moses said it in order to indicate: On <b>this day, my days and years have been completed</b> to be precisely one hundred and twenty, in order <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is written: “The number of your days I will fill”</b> (Exodus 23:26), indicating that the righteous will live out their years fully. |
| Exodus 23:26 | Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days” | Yevamot 49b:7 | The Gemara expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said:</b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him.</b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said:</b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6). |
| Exodus 23:27 | no entity was able to stand before them. And anyone who stood before them was immediately struck with diarrhea, as it is stated: “I will send My terror before you, and will confound all the people that you encounter” | Sotah 36a:2 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the entrance of the Jewish people into Eretz Yisrael: <b>Come and see how many miracles were performed on that day: The Jewish people crossed the Jordan, and they arrived at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal,</b> which are <b>more than sixty <i>mil</i></b> from the river, <b>and</b> on that day <b>no entity was able to stand before them. And anyone who stood before them was immediately struck with diarrhea, as it is stated: “I will send My terror before you, and will confound all the people that you encounter”</b> (Exodus 23:27). |
| Exodus 23:28 | not? But isn’t it written: “And I will send the hornet before you, | Sotah 36a:8 | It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:10): The <b>hornet [<i>tzira</i>] did not cross</b> the Jordan <b>with them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did it <b>not? But isn’t it written: “And I will send the hornet before you,</b> which shall drive out the Hivites, and the Canaanites” (Exodus 23:28)? |
| Exodus 23:33 | “They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you to sin against Me, | Gittin 45a:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the residents of the Land of Canaan: <b>“They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you to sin against Me,</b> for you will serve their gods; for they will be a snare to you” (Exodus 23:33). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the verse is</b> also <b>speaking of a gentile who accepted upon himself not to</b> engage in <b>idol worship,</b> and is teaching that such a gentile may not dwell in Eretz Yisrael as well; therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall not deliver to his master a slave who escaped to you from his master”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16). The <i>baraita</i> understands that the verse is speaking in metaphoric terms about a gentile who has come to Eretz Yisrael, escaping his idolatrous past. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is this gentile’s <b>remedy? “He shall dwell with you in your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:17). This teaches that as long as he accepts upon himself not to engage in idol worship, he may remain in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Exodus 24:1 | “And to Moses He said: Come up to the Lord” | Sanhedrin 38b:19 | <b>Rav Naḥman says: This one,</b> i.e., any person, <b>who knows</b> how <b>to respond to the heretics</b> as effectively <b>as Rav Idit should respond</b> to them, <b>but if</b> he does <b>not</b> know, he <b>should not respond</b> to them. The Gemara relates: <b>A certain heretic said to Rav Idit:</b> It <b>is written</b> in the verse concerning God: <b>“And to Moses He said: Come up to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 24:1). The heretic raised a question: <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>Come up to Me.</b> Rav Idit <b>said to him: This</b> term, “the Lord,” in that verse <b>is</b> referring to the angel <b>Metatron, whose name is like the name of his Master, as it is written:</b> “Behold I send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Take heed of him and obey his voice; do not defy him; for he will not pardon your transgression, <b>for My name is in him”</b> (Exodus 23:20–21). |
| Exodus 24:5 | as it is written: “And they sacrificed peace-offerings | Chagigah 6a:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, what is different</b> about <b>the Festival peace</b>-offering, <b>that it existed before the speech</b> of God, <b>as it is written: “And they sacrificed peace-offerings</b> of bulls to the Lord” (Exodus 24:5)? The burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> is <b>also</b> mentioned, as <b>isn’t it written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And they sacrificed burnt</b>-offerings”? |
| Exodus 24:5 | ” | Chagigah 6b:12 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raises a dilemma: This verse, how is it written,</b> i.e., how should it be understood? Should the following verse be read as two separate halves, with the first part consisting of: <b>“And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, and they sacrificed burnt-</b>offerings<b>”</b> (Exodus 24:5), which were <b>sheep;</b> and the second part consisting of the rest of the verse: <b>“And they sacrificed peace-</b>offerings <b>of bulls to the Lord,”</b> i.e., these peace-offerings alone were bulls? <b>Or perhaps both of these</b> were <b>bulls,</b> as the term: “Bulls,” refers both to the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings. |
| Exodus 24:5 | a burnt offering and a peace offering | Keritot 8b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a meal offering and peace offering, that</b> if the convert brings these he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as it is written:</b> “And if a stranger dwell with you, or whosoever may be among you, throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord; <b>as you do, so he shall do”</b> (Numbers 15:14). From this verse it is derived: <b>Just as you</b> brought <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> when you entered the covenant on Mount Sinai, as it is stated: “And they sacrificed burnt offerings, and they sacrificed peace offerings” (Exodus 24:5), <b>so too, a convert</b> must bring <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering.</b> |
| Exodus 24:5 | the sprinkling of blood, as it is written: “And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, | Keritot 9a:9 | The Gemara continues: And granted as well, they entered the covenant through <b>the sprinkling of blood, as it is written: “And he sent the young men of the children of Israel,</b> and they sacrificed burnt offerings, and they sacrificed peace offerings” (Exodus 24:5). The Gemara asks: <b>But from where do we</b> derive that <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath was also part of the process of entering the covenant? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Moses took half the blood</b>…<b>and sprinkled it on the people”</b> (Exodus 24:6–8), <b>and there is no sprinkling</b> of sacrificial blood <b>without immersion.</b> |
| Exodus 24:5 | And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt and in other lands, was four hundred years. | Megillah 9a:16 | Instead of: “And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years” (Exodus 12:40), which when read literally is imprecise, for they did not dwell in Egypt that long, they wrote: <b>And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt and in other lands, was four hundred years.</b> Instead of: “And he sent the youth of the children of Israel, who brought burnt-offerings” (Exodus 24:5), which evokes the question of why young men were sent to perform that service, they wrote: <b>And he sent the elect [<i>za’atutei</i>] of the children of Israel.</b> The same term was substituted again several verses later, rendering the verse: “And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand” (Exodus 24:11), as: <b>And upon the elect of the children of Israel He laid not His hand.</b> |
| Exodus 24:5 | “And he sent the young men of the children of Israel who sacrificed burnt-offerings” | Yoma 52b:7 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And in the Torah</b> itself, <b>are there no</b> other examples of indeterminate punctuation? <b>But there is</b> this <b>dilemma that Rav Ḥisda raised</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And he sent the young men of the children of Israel who sacrificed burnt-offerings”</b> (Exodus 24:5); were these burnt-offerings <b>sheep,</b> and when the verse continues: <b>“And sacrificed peace-offerings of bulls to the Lord,”</b> these peace-offerings alone were bulls? <b>Or perhaps these and these</b> were <b>bulls,</b> as the word “bulls” is referring both to the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings? This is another verse whose punctuation is unclear. The Gemara rejects this contention: This is not difficult; <b>according to Rav Ḥisda</b> it <b>was uncertain</b> how to read the verse, but the interpretation was <b>obvious to Isi ben Yehuda.</b> |
| Exodus 24:5 | “And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, | Zevachim 115b:6 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Until the Tabernacle was established,</b> private altars were permitted and the sacrificial service was performed by the firstborn. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina was sitting before Rav Ḥisda and was reading</b> this verse with regard to the revelation at Sinai: <b>“And he sent the young men of the children of Israel,</b> who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord” (Exodus 24:5). The young men referred to in the verse were the firstborn of the Jewish people. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Asi said: They sacrificed</b> the offerings <b>and</b> then <b>ceased</b> to serve; after that day, the firstborn no longer performed the sacrificial service. |
| Exodus 24:5 | and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord” | Zevachim 116a:12 | § In describing the sacrificial service before the Tabernacle was constructed, <b>the Master said: And all</b> offerings brought before the construction of the Tabernacle were <b>sacrificed</b> as <b>burnt offerings.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Burnt offerings, yes,</b> were sacrificed, but <b>peace offerings</b> were <b>not</b> sacrificed. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> with regard to the offerings that were sacrificed at Mount Sinai at the time of the giving of the Torah, <b>it is written:</b> “And they offered burnt offerings, <b>and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 24:5). This event occurred prior to the construction of the Tabernacle. <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>All</b> offerings <b>sacrificed</b> were either <b>burnt offerings or peace offerings.</b> |
| Exodus 24:7 | “We will hear” | Gittin 7a:18 | With regard to the above verse, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“This shall no more be the same”? Rabbi Avira interpreted</b> this verse <b>homiletically. Sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Ami, and sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Asi: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people</b> at the time of the destruction of the Temple: <b>“Remove the mitre and take off the garland,” the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> is <b>this</b> the appropriate treatment <b>for the Jewish people, who,</b> at the giving of the Torah <b>at Sinai, preceded</b> the statement of: <b>“We will do” to</b> the statement: <b>“We will hear”</b> (Exodus 24:7)? |
| Exodus 24:7 | A certain Sadducee said to him: Hasty people who put your mouths before your ears, | Ketubot 112a:17 | § <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended to Eretz Yisrael he could not find a ferry to cross</b> the Jordan River. <b>He took hold of a rope</b> that was strung across as a makeshift bridge <b>and crossed</b> the Jordan. <b>A certain Sadducee said to him: Hasty people who put your mouths before your ears,</b> when you said at the time of the giving of the Torah: “We will do” before “we will hear” (Exodus 24:7), <b>you remain hasty</b> to this day. Why couldn’t you wait a little longer to cross the river on a ferry? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a place where Moses and Aaron did not merit</b> entering; <b>who is to say that I will merit</b> seeing this land? I hurried across before anything might occur to prevent my entrance into Eretz Yisrael. |
| Exodus 24:8 | “And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people” | Yevamot 46b:4 | <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua derived it <b>from here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the formation of the covenant at Sinai: <b>“And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people”</b> (Exodus 24:8), <b>and it is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that there is no</b> ritual <b>sprinkling without immersion.</b> Therefore, our forefathers also must have immersed at Sinai, and consequently that is also an essential requirement for all conversions. |
| Exodus 24:9 | every court that has stood from the days of Moses until now. As it is stated: “Then Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel” | Rosh Hashanah25a:5 | Rabbi Yehoshua then <b>came to Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas,</b> who <b>said to him: If we come to debate</b> and question the rulings of <b>the court of Rabban Gamliel, we must debate</b> and question the rulings of <b>every court that has stood from the days of Moses until now. As it is stated: “Then Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel”</b> (Exodus 24:9). <b>But why were the names of these</b> seventy <b>Elders not specified? Rather,</b> this comes <b>to teach that every</b> set of <b>three</b> judges <b>that stands</b> as <b>a court over the Jewish people</b> has the same status <b>as the court of Moses.</b> Since it is not revealed who sat on that court, apparently it is enough that they were official judges in a Jewish court. |
| Exodus 24:10 | to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the sapphire stone, and the sapphire stone is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet | Chullin 89a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about sky-blue from all other colors</b> such that it was specified for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because sky-blue</b> dye <b>is similar</b> in its color <b>to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the sapphire stone, and the sapphire stone is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet</b> the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness” (Exodus 24:10). This verse shows that the heavens are similar to sapphire, <b>and it is written:</b> “And above the firmament that was over their heads was <b>the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). Therefore, the throne is similar to the heavens. The color of sky blue dye acts as an indication of the bond between the Jewish people and the Divine Presence. |
| Exodus 24:10 | and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness” | Menachot 43b:13 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about <i>tekhelet</i> from all</b> other <b>types of colors</b> such that it was chosen for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because <i>tekhelet</i> is similar</b> in its color <b>to</b> the <b>sea, and</b> the <b>sea is similar to</b> the <b>sky, and</b> the <b>sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated:</b> “And they saw the God of Israel; <b>and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10), indicating that the sky is like a sapphire brickwork. <b>And it is written: “The likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). |
| Exodus 24:10 | to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness” | Sotah 17a:24 | It is <b>because sky-blue</b> dye <b>is similar</b> in its color <b>to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10). This verse shows that the heavens are similar to sapphire, <b>and it is written:</b> “And above the firmament that was over their heads was <b>the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). Therefore, the throne is similar to the heavens. The color of sky blue dye acts as an indication of the bond between the Jewish people and the Divine Presence. |
| Exodus 24:10 | the altar itself, as it is written: “Like the very sky for purity [ latohar ]” | Yoma 15b:1 | Rather, <i>tohoro</i> means <b>on</b> top of <b>the altar itself, as it is written: “Like the very sky for purity [<i>latohar</i>]”</b> (Exodus 24:10). <i>Tohoro</i> refers to the top of the altar after the ashes of the incense are cleared and the pure gold is visible. |
| Exodus 24:10 | altar, as it is written: “And the like of the very heaven for clearness [ letohar ]” | Yoma 59a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection: When he sprinkles</b> on the inner altar, <b>he sprinkles neither on top of the ash nor on top of the coals; rather, he rakes</b> and removes <b>the coals to both sides and sprinkles.</b> This indicates that this sprinkling was performed on top of the altar, not on its side. <b>Rather, Rabba bar Rav Sheila</b> retracted his previous interpretation and said: On <i>tohoro</i> of the altar means <b>on the exposed</b> area <b>of</b> the <b>altar, as it is written: “And the like of the very heaven for clearness [<i>letohar</i>]”</b> (Exodus 24:10), which shows that <i>tohar</i> is an expression of clarity. |
| Exodus 24:10 | as it is written: “Like the very clear [ latohar ] sky” | Zevachim 38b:1 | <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>middle</b> of the side <b>of the altar, as people say: Clear noon [<i>tihara</i>],</b> that is the middle <b>of the day?</b> Accordingly, the root <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>reish</i> denotes the middle; in the one case, the middle of the day, and in the other case, halfway up the altar. Now, since the blood was sprinkled on the altar seven times, inevitably some of the blood landed above the midpoint and some of it landed below the midpoint. <b>Rava bar Sheila said: No,</b> that is not the meaning of <i>tohoro</i>. Rather, <i>tohoro</i> means <b>on the revealed</b> part, i.e., the top, of the altar, <b>as it is written: “Like the very clear [<i>latohar</i>] sky”</b> (Exodus 24:10). <i>Tohoro</i> is referring to the top of the altar when it has been revealed, after the ashes of the incense are cleared and the pure gold is visible. |
| Exodus 24:11 | “And they beheld God, and they ate and drank” | Berakhot 17a:12 | <b>Rav was wont to say:</b> <br><b>The World-to-Come is not like this world.</b> <br><b>In the World-to-Come there is no eating, no drinking,</b> <br><b>no procreation, no</b> business <b>negotiations,</b> <br><b>no jealousy, no hatred, and no competition.</b> <br><b>Rather, the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads, enjoying the splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated:</b> <br><b>“And they beheld God, and they ate and drank”</b> (Exodus 24:11), meaning that beholding God’s countenance is tantamount to eating and drinking. |
| Exodus 24:11 | And he sent the elect [ za’atutei ] of the children of Israel. | Megillah 9a:16 | Instead of: “And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years” (Exodus 12:40), which when read literally is imprecise, for they did not dwell in Egypt that long, they wrote: <b>And the residence of the children of Israel, who resided in Egypt and in other lands, was four hundred years.</b> Instead of: “And he sent the youth of the children of Israel, who brought burnt-offerings” (Exodus 24:5), which evokes the question of why young men were sent to perform that service, they wrote: <b>And he sent the elect [<i>za’atutei</i>] of the children of Israel.</b> The same term was substituted again several verses later, rendering the verse: “And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand” (Exodus 24:11), as: <b>And upon the elect of the children of Israel He laid not His hand.</b> |
| Exodus 24:12 | it says: “And I will give [ ve’etna ] you the stone tablets, and the Torah and the mitzva, | Berakhot 48b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> with regard to Grace after Meals continues: <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for <b>Grace after Meals. From where</b> is the obligation to recite <b>the blessing of the Torah</b> derived? Several answers are offered: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> from Grace after Meals: <b>Over</b> food, which is an aspect of <b>temporal life, one recites a blessing, all the more so</b> one recites a blessing over the Torah, which is <b>eternal life. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Naḥmani,</b> the <b>student of Rabbi Yishmael, says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: This</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>is not necessary,</b> as this <i>halakha</i> can be derived from the same verse from which Grace after Meals is derived, <b>as it states: “For the good land that He gave [<i>natan</i>] you,” and below,</b> with regard to the Torah, <b>it says: “And I will give [<i>ve’etna</i>] you the stone tablets, and the Torah and the mitzva,</b> which I have written, that you may teach them” (Exodus 24:12). Here, just as giving with regard to the good land requires a blessing, giving with regard to the Torah requires a blessing. |
| Exodus 24:12 | and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the mitzva that I have written that you may teach them” | Berakhot 5a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> God said to Moses, “Ascend to me on the mountain and be there, <b>and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the mitzva that I have written that you may teach them”</b> (Exodus 24:12), meaning that God revealed to Moses not only the Written Torah, but all of Torah, as it would be transmitted through the generations. <br><b>The “tablets” are the ten commandments</b> that were written on the tablets of the Covenant, <br><b>the “Torah” is the five books of Moses.</b> <br><b>The “mitzva” is the Mishna,</b> which includes explanations for the mitzvot and how they are to be performed. <br><b>“That I have written” refers to the Prophets and Writings,</b> written with divine inspiration. <br><b>“That you may teach them” refers to the Talmud,</b> which explains the Mishna. <br>These explanations are the foundation for the rulings of practical <i>halakha</i>. This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>all</b> aspects of Torah <b>were given to</b> Moses <b>from Sinai.</b> |
| Exodus 24:13 | and it shall be a righteousness for you | Bava Metzia82a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him and is considered its owner as long as the item is in his possession? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “You shall return the pledge to him when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be a righteousness for you</b> before the Lord your God” (Exodus 24:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak infers: <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire the collateral,</b> then <b>from where is the righteousness</b> involved in returning it? In this case, the creditor would not be giving up anything of his own. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires the collateral.</b> |
| Exodus 24:14 | “Whoever has a cause, let him come near [ yiggash ] to them” | Bava Kamma46b:5 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant? As it is stated</b> in the Torah when Moses appointed Aaron and Hur to judge the people: <b>“Whoever has a cause, let him come near [<i>yiggash</i>] to them”</b> (Exodus 24:14). This is interpreted to mean that whoever has a claim against another <b>should submit [<i>yaggish</i>] proof to them.</b> According to this interpretation, this verse demonstrates clearly that the claimant is responsible for supplying the proof. |
| Exodus 24:16 | as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day | Taanit 28b:9 | According to <b>the one who said</b> that the Ten Commandments <b>were given on the seventh</b> of Sivan, <b>they were given on the seventh, and on the seventh Moses ascended</b> to Mount Sinai, <b>as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day</b> out of the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16), <b>and it is written: “And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and he went up into the mount, and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights”</b> (Exodus 24:18). The calculation is as follows: There were <b>twenty-four</b> days remaining <b>in Sivan, plus</b> the first <b>sixteen days of Tammuz,</b> which <b>comes to forty</b> days. |
| Exodus 24:16 | from Sinai, as it is written: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered him [ vaykhasehu ] six days, and He called to Moses on the seventh day | Yoma 3b:14 | Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>Rather, from where do</b> you, <b>Master, derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of sequestering before Yom Kippur? Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> I derive it <b>from Sinai, as it is written: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered him [<i>vaykhasehu</i>] six days, and He called to Moses on the seventh day</b> from the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16). The masculine suffix <i>hu</i> in <i>vaykhasehu</i> can be interpreted either as him, referring to Moses, or as it, referring to the mountain. <b>Now, since it states: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day,” what is</b> derived from the previous explicit mention of <b>six days? These</b> six days are mentioned as <b>a paradigm,</b> from which a general principle is derived <b>that anyone who enters the camp of the Divine Presence,</b> the site of the revelation at Mount Sinai, or the place where the Divine Presence rests, the Holy of Holies, <b>requires</b> prior <b>sequestering for six</b> days of sanctification. |
| Exodus 24:16 | Moses ascended in the cloud, and was covered in the cloud, and was sanctified in the cloud, in order to receive the Torah for the Jewish people in sanctity, as it is stated: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai | Yoma 4a:10 | § And a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that sequestering is derived from Sinai: <b>Moses ascended in the cloud, and was covered in the cloud, and was sanctified in the cloud, in order to receive the Torah for the Jewish people in sanctity, as it is stated: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai</b> and the cloud covered him six days, and He called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16). <b>This was an incident</b> that occurred <b>after the</b> revelation of <b>the Ten Commandments</b> to the Jewish people, and these six days <b>were the beginning</b> of the <b>forty days</b> that Moses was on the mountain (see Exodus 24:18); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> The opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili corresponds to that of Reish Lakish; Moses withdrew for six days before receiving permission to stand in the presence of God. |
| Exodus 24:16 | as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day” | Yoma 4b:3 | § Apropos the interpretation of the verse with regard to revelation, the Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what do Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that their dispute is parallel <b>to the dispute between these</b> other <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the sixth</b> day <b>of the month</b> of Sivan, <b>the Torah,</b> the Ten Commandments, <b>was given to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It was <b>on the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> the month. According to the <b>one who said</b> that it was <b>on the sixth,</b> the Torah <b>was given on the sixth,</b> which is the day of the revelation of the Ten Commandments, <b>and on the seventh</b> day of the month Moses <b>ascended</b> the mountain, <b>as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day”</b> (Exodus 24:16). According to the <b>one who said</b> that the Torah was given <b>on the seventh</b> of the month, <b>it was given on the seventh and Moses ascended on the seventh, as it is written: “And he called to Moses on the seventh day.”</b> |
| Exodus 24:18 | and it is written: “And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and he went up into the mount, and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights” | Taanit 28b:9 | According to <b>the one who said</b> that the Ten Commandments <b>were given on the seventh</b> of Sivan, <b>they were given on the seventh, and on the seventh Moses ascended</b> to Mount Sinai, <b>as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day</b> out of the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16), <b>and it is written: “And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and he went up into the mount, and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights”</b> (Exodus 24:18). The calculation is as follows: There were <b>twenty-four</b> days remaining <b>in Sivan, plus</b> the first <b>sixteen days of Tammuz,</b> which <b>comes to forty</b> days. |
| Exodus 24:18 | “And Moses came into the cloud” | Yoma 4b:9 | <b>Rabbi Zerika raised a contradiction between verses before Rabbi Elazar, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in one place: <b>“And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud dwelt on it”</b> (Exodus 40:35), as Moses was unable to enter the cloud. <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“And Moses came into the cloud”</b> (Exodus 24:18). <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, grabbed Moses and brought him into the cloud</b> since he could not enter on his own. |
| Exodus 25:2 | “Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering” | Avodah Zarah23b:10 | § Earlier, Sheila provided a rationale for Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling that a red heifer may not be purchased from gentiles. The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Sheila teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “Speak unto the children of Israel that they take to you</b> a red heifer” (Numbers 19:2). This indicates that <b>the children of Israel take</b> the red heifer, <b>but gentiles do not take</b> the red heifer. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse states with regard to the donations for the Tabernacle: <b>“Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering”</b> (Exodus 25:2), <b>so too</b> one can claim <b>that</b> only <b>the children of Israel take</b> an offering for God, <b>but gentiles do not take</b> an offering, and that no items for the Temple service may be purchased from gentiles. |
| Exodus 25:2 | matter. | Avodah Zarah24a:2 | The Gemara answers that the phrase <b>“onyx stones”</b> (Exodus 25:7) <b>concluded</b> discussion of that <b>matter.</b> In other words, almost all the items listed in Exodus, chapter 25, for the contributions to the Tabernacle, are joined by the conjunction “and.” Before the verse mentions the stones for the ephod, it states “onyx stones,” without the conjunction “and.” This omission serves to disconnect these stones from the earlier phrase: “That they take” (Exodus 25:2), which means that the disqualification of items purchased from gentiles for use in the Temple derived from this phrase does not apply to the items listed after that point, including the stones of the ephod. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it</b> subsequently <b>written: “And stones to be set,”</b> by <b>which the verse goes back and combines</b> the list, so that the earlier verse applies once more? Accordingly, it should be prohibited to purchase any of the items listed in the verse from gentiles. |
| Exodus 25:2 | A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu: Your God is a priest, as it is written: “That they take for Me an offering [ teruma ]” | Sanhedrin 39a:14 | <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu: Your God is a priest, as it is written: “That they take for Me an offering [<i>teruma</i>]”</b> (Exodus 25:2), and <i>teruma</i> is given to the priests. He asked, sarcastically: <b>When He buried Moses, in what</b> ritual bath <b>did He immerse?</b> A priest who contracts impurity from a corpse must immerse in order to be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if you would say</b> that He immersed <b>in water, but isn’t it written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand”</b> (Isaiah 40:12), that all waters of the world fit in the palm of God, so He could not immerse in them. |
| Exodus 25:7 | “onyx stones” | Avodah Zarah24a:2 | The Gemara answers that the phrase <b>“onyx stones”</b> (Exodus 25:7) <b>concluded</b> discussion of that <b>matter.</b> In other words, almost all the items listed in Exodus, chapter 25, for the contributions to the Tabernacle, are joined by the conjunction “and.” Before the verse mentions the stones for the ephod, it states “onyx stones,” without the conjunction “and.” This omission serves to disconnect these stones from the earlier phrase: “That they take” (Exodus 25:2), which means that the disqualification of items purchased from gentiles for use in the Temple derived from this phrase does not apply to the items listed after that point, including the stones of the ephod.

Accordingly, it should be prohibited to purchase any of the items listed in the verse from gentiles. |
| Exodus 25:8 | from here: “And let them make Me a Temple that I may dwell among them” | Eruvin 2b:1 | <b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the ark</b> and the other sacred objects in the Tabernacle, as the sons of Kehat carried only the sacred vessels and not the Tabernacle itself. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle. |
| Exodus 25:8 | And ultimately it is written: “And let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them” | Ketubot 62b:9 | The proof for this is that <b>initially it is written: “You bring them and plant them</b> in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place that You, O Lord, have made for You to dwell in” (Exodus 15:17), which indicates that God’s original intention was to build a Temple for the Jewish people after they had entered Eretz Yisrael. <b>And ultimately it is written: “And let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), i.e., even while they were still in the desert, which indicates that due to their closeness to God, they enjoyed greater affection and He therefore advanced what would originally have come later. |
| Exodus 25:8 | from here: “And let them make Me a Temple, that I may dwell among them” | Shevuot 16b:4 | The Gemara questions its previous assumption: <b>Granted, the Temple is</b> also <b>called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), where the reference is to the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people have settled in their land. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that the Tabernacle is</b> also <b>called Temple? If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward”</b> (Numbers 10:21), <b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the Ark</b> and the other sacred vessels. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle, as immediately afterward <b>it is written: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 25:9). |
| Exodus 25:8 | “And let them make Me | Temurah 31b:7 | § The mishna teaches that the Temple treasurer <b>does not give craftsmen compensation from</b> money designated for purchasing animals consecrated for the altar. The Gemara asks: It may be inferred from the mishna <b>that consecrations for Temple maintenance are given</b> to craftsmen. From where is this <i>halakha</i> derived? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states,</b> with regard to the mitzva to build the Tabernacle: <b>“And let them make Me</b> a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8). The verse indicates that the Tabernacle can be constructed <b>from</b> that which is <b>Mine,</b> i.e., consecrated property. Consequently, consecrated property may be used to pay the wages of a craftsman for work performed in the service of the Tabernacle. |
| Exodus 25:9 | and so shall you do” | Sanhedrin 16b:4 | § The mishna teaches: <b>They may extend the city</b> of Jerusalem or the courtyards of the Temple only on the basis of a court of seventy-one judges. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya says: The verse states: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle</b> and the pattern of all its vessels, <b>and so shall you do”</b> (Exodus 25:9). “And so shall you do” means <b>for future generations;</b> just as the Tabernacle was fashioned in all of its details according to Moses’ instructions, so too later, the Temple is fashioned according to the instructions of the Great Sanhedrin, whose members stand in place of Moses. |
| Exodus 25:9 | and so shall you do” | Shevuot 15a:1 | <b>and so shall you do”</b> (Exodus 25:9). The final words: “And so shall you do,” are superfluous and serve to teach: As was done in the Tabernacle, so shall you do <b>in</b> future <b>generations.</b> |
| Exodus 25:9 | it is written: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle” | Shevuot 16b:4 | The Gemara questions its previous assumption: <b>Granted, the Temple is</b> also <b>called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), where the reference is to the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people have settled in their land. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that the Tabernacle is</b> also <b>called Temple? If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward”</b> (Numbers 10:21), <b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the Ark</b> and the other sacred vessels. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle, as immediately afterward <b>it is written: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 25:9). |
| Exodus 25:10 | from here: “Two cubits [ amatayim ] and a half shall be its length” | Sanhedrin 29a:35 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya says</b> that the idea that one who adds, subtracts can also be proven <b>from here: “Two cubits [<i>amatayim</i>] and a half shall be its length”</b> (Exodus 25:10). Without the letter <i>alef</i> at the beginning of the word <i>amatayim</i>, it would be read <i>matayim</i>, which would mean two hundred cubits. The addition of the <i>alef</i> therefore reduces this term to only two cubits. |
| Exodus 25:10 | as it is written: “And they shall make an Ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height” | Sukkah 5a:5 | The Gemara wonders about the proof offered: <b>Granted,</b> the height of the <b>Ark</b> was <b>nine</b> handbreadths, <b>as it is written: “And they shall make an Ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height”</b> (Exodus 25:10), and one and a half cubits equal nine handbreadths. <b>However, from where do we</b> derive the fact that the thickness of the <b>Ark cover</b> was one <b>handbreadth?</b> The Torah never states its dimensions explicitly, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina taught:</b> For <b>all the vessels that Moses crafted</b> for the Tabernacle, <b>the Torah provided</b> in <b>their</b> regard <b>the dimension of their length, the dimension of their width, and the dimension of their height.</b> However, for the <b>Ark cover,</b> the Torah <b>provided the dimension of its length and the dimension of its width;</b> but the Torah <b>did not provide the dimension of its height.</b> |
| Exodus 25:10 | “And they shall make an ark of acacia wood” | Yoma 3b:3 | <b>Abba Ḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Elazar</b> that <b>one verse says: “And make you an ark of wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), indicating that it should be from your own property; <b>and one verse says</b> on the same subject: <b>“And they shall make an ark of acacia wood”</b> (Exodus 25:10), meaning from the Jewish people. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> contradiction be resolved? <b>Here,</b> the verse is referring <b>to a time when the Jewish people perform the will of God</b> and they are credited with building the Ark of the Covenant. <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to a time when the Jewish people do not perform the will of God,</b> and construction of the Ark is attributed to Moses alone. According to that opinion, there is no difference between the offerings of Yom Kippur and other offerings. |
| Exodus 25:10 | and it is written: “And they shall make an Ark of acacia wood” | Yoma 72b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction: It is written: “And you shall make for yourself a wooden Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), implying that Moses alone was commanded to construct the Ark; <b>and it is written: “And they shall make an Ark of acacia wood”</b> (Exodus 25:10), implying that the Jewish people were all commanded to be involved in its construction. The apparent resolution to this contradiction is that although only Moses actually constructed the Ark, everyone was required to support the endeavor. So too, <b>from here</b> it is derived with regard <b>to a Torah scholar that the members of his town should perform his work for him</b> to support him and allow him to focus on his studies, since it is also the town’s responsibility to enable him to study. |
| Exodus 25:11 | is written | Yoma 72b:7 | § The Gemara presents a number of statements based on the idea that the Ark symbolizes the Torah: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction:</b> According to the way the word crown <b>is written</b> in the Torah (Exodus 25:11), without vowels, it should be pronounced <b><i>zar</i>,</b> meaning strange, <b>but</b> according to the traditional vocalization <b>we read</b> it as <b><i>zeir</i>,</b> meaning crown. These two ways of understanding the word appear to contradict each other. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: The two understandings apply to two different situations: If one <b>is deserving</b> by performing mitzvot, <b>it becomes a crown [<i>zeir</i>] for him;</b> but if one <b>is not deserving,</b> the Torah <b>will be a stranger [<i>zara</i>] to him</b> and he will forget his studies. |
| Exodus 25:11 | “From within and from without you shall cover it” | Yoma 72b:9 | The verse states concerning the Ark: <b>“From within and from without you shall cover it”</b> (Exodus 25:11). <b>Rava said:</b> This alludes to the idea that <b>any Torah scholar whose inside is not like his outside,</b> i.e., whose outward expression of righteousness is insincere, <b>is not</b> to be considered <b>a Torah scholar.</b> |
| Exodus 25:15 | they shall not be removed | Makkot 22a:8 | <b>Abaye objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate one who loosens the breastplate from upon the ephod</b> in the course of plowing, <b>or one who removes the staves of the Ark</b> of the Covenant. <b>And its prohibition is from here:</b> “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; <b>they shall not be removed</b> from it” (Exodus 25:15), while the relevant verse with regard to the breastplate is: <b>“And the breastplate shall not be loosened</b> from the ephod” (Exodus 28:28). |
| Exodus 25:15 | it is written: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be removed from it” | Yoma 72a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be removed from it”</b> (Exodus 25:15), implying the staves should remain there permanently. But in another verse <b>it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings”</b> (Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. <b>How is this</b> contradiction resolved? The staves <b>could be removed</b> from their position, i.e., they were loosened, but <b>did not come out.</b> The staves were wider at their ends and thinner in the middle. Therefore, once they had been forced into the rings, although they could be shifted, they would not be removed entirely. |
| Exodus 25:15 | “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; | Yoma 72a:11 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark;</b> they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they should not move from their place</b> at all; therefore; <b>the verse states: “And its staves shall be put into the rings”</b> (Exodus 27:7). <b>If</b> it had stated: <b>And its staves shall be put,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they are inserted and removed</b> entirely; therefore, <b>the verse states: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark;</b> they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). <b>How is this? They could be removed</b> from their position, but <b>did not come out.</b> |
| Exodus 25:15 | they shall not be removed | Yoma 72a:9 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who detaches the breastplate from upon the ephod</b> or <b>one who removes the staves of the Ark</b> from their rings transgresses a Torah prohibition and <b>is flogged, as it is stated:</b> “And the breastplate <b>shall not be detached</b> from the ephod” (Exodus 28:28),and it is also stated: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; <b>they shall not be removed</b> from it” (Exodus 25:15). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to this:</b> But <b>perhaps when the Merciful One said</b> this in the Torah, the intention was <b>to strengthen them and make them fast so that</b> the breastplate <b>not become detached</b> from the ephod <b>and</b> the staves <b>not be removed.</b> He suggests that the Torah was giving an explanation, not a prohibition. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: In order that it not become detached, and: In order that they not be removed?</b> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition. |
| Exodus 25:20 | “And their faces were toward the House,” isn’t it written: “With their faces one toward the other” | Bava Batra99a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> they stood as described in the verse: <b>“And their faces were toward the House,” isn’t it written: “With their faces one toward the other”</b> (Exodus 25:20). How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>They were angled sideways</b> so that they turned both to each other and toward the Sanctuary, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Onkelos the Convert said</b> that the <b>cherubs were</b> of the <b>form of children,</b> as the verse states: “And in the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of the form of children; and they overlaid them with gold” (II Chronicles 3:10), <b>and their faces were angled sideways</b> toward the Ark of the Covenant, <b>like a student taking leave of his teacher.</b> |
| Exodus 25:20 | as it is written: “Toward the Ark cover shall be the faces of [ penei ] the cherubs” | Sukkah 5b:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the face of the <b>cherub</b> in the Tabernacle and the Temple, <b>as it is written: “Toward the Ark cover shall be the faces of [<i>penei</i>] the cherubs”</b> (Exodus 25:20), and their faces were presumably smaller than one handbreadth. |
| Exodus 25:20 | And it is written: “And the cherubs shall spread out their wings upward, screening [ sokhekhim ] the Ark cover with their wings” | Sukkah 5b:9 | And to calculate: <b>How many</b> cubits high <b>was the Tabernacle?</b> It was <b>ten cubits, as it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a beam”</b> (Exodus 26:16). <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>do these</b> ten cubits contain? They contain <b>sixty handbreadths. And one third of that</b> total <b>is how many?</b> It is <b>twenty handbreadths. Subtract</b> from this figure <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>of the Ark and the Ark cover</b> upon which the cherubs stood, and <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>remain,</b> which was the height of each individual cherub. <b>And it is written: “And the cherubs shall spread out their wings upward, screening [<i>sokhekhim</i>] the Ark cover with their wings”</b> (Exodus 25:20). Here <b>the Merciful One is referring to</b> the wings using the terminology of <b>roofing [<i>sekhakha</i>]</b> specifically <b>when</b> they are <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>above</b> the Ark cover. This is a source that the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is placed at least ten handbreadths high. |
| Exodus 25:22 | “And there I will meet with you, and I will speak to you from above the Ark cover, | Rosh Hashanah31a:15 | The Gemara cites the sources for each of these stages: <b>From the Ark cover</b> the Divine Presence traveled <b>to the cherub,</b> and <b>from</b> one <b>cherub to</b> the other <b>cherub, and from the</b> second <b>cherub to the threshold, as it is written</b> with regard to Moses in the Tabernacle: <b>“And there I will meet with you, and I will speak to you from above the Ark cover,</b> from between the two cherubs” (Exodus 25:22). <b>And it is written: “And He rode upon a cherub, and flew”</b> (II Samuel 22:11), which indicates that the glory of the Divine Presence can rest upon one cherub. <b>And it is written: “And the glory of the God of Israel had ascended from the cherub, on which it was, to the threshold of the House”</b> (Ezekiel 9:3), i.e., the Divine Presence moved from the cherub to the threshold. |
| Exodus 25:22 | Initially, it was written: “I will meet with you there and I will speak with you from above the Ark Cover” | Sanhedrin 7a:14 | There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was saying</b> about his marriage <b>as he walked: When our love was strong, we</b> could have <b>slept on</b> a bed that was <b>the width of a sword. Now that our love is not strong, a bed of sixty cubits</b> is <b>not sufficient for us. Rav Huna said: Verses</b> are <b>written</b> that convey these sentiments. <b>Initially, it was written: “I will meet with you there and I will speak with you from above the Ark Cover”</b> (Exodus 25:22), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Ark</b> of the Covenant was itself <b>nine</b> handbreadths high, <b>and</b> the <b>Ark Cover</b> was one <b>handbreadth</b> thick. <b>There</b> is a total height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>here.</b> At first, when God had great affection for Israel, the Divine Presence was revealed within the confines of this limited space. |
| Exodus 25:22 | here. And it is written: “I will meet with you there and I will speak with you from above the Ark cover” | Sukkah 4b:17 | And this is what they taught: The <b>Ark</b> of the Covenant was itself <b>nine</b> handbreadths high, as it is stated explicitly in the Torah that it was one and a half cubits high and the cubit used to measure Temple vessels consisted of six handbreadths. <b>And</b> the <b>Ark cover</b> was one <b>handbreadth</b> thick. <b>There</b> is a total height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>here. And it is written: “I will meet with you there and I will speak with you from above the Ark cover”</b> (Exodus 25:22), |
| Exodus 25:25 | frame, | Menachot 96b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the Table’s decorated <b>frame,</b> which ran around its perimeter and was one handbreadth wide, as the verse states: “And you shall make for it a frame of a handbreadth” (Exodus 25:25)? Since the arrangements are placed on the Table’s frame, they rise one additional handbreadth above the Table. |
| Exodus 25:25 | handbreadth | Niddah 26b:5 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b>frame</b> of the Table in the Temple, which is one <b>handbreadth</b> wide, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 25:25)? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not dealing with</b> matters <b>that are written</b> in the Torah. The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there the Ark Cover,</b> which is one <b>handbreadth</b> thick, and its measure is not written explicitly in the Torah? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not dealing with consecrated</b> items. |
| Exodus 25:25 | “And you shall make unto it a border of a handbreadth around” | Sukkah 5a:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>Go out and learn from the smallest</b> dimension mentioned in connection with any <b>of the</b> Tabernacle <b>vessels, as it is stated</b> with regard to the shewbread table: <b>“And you shall make unto it a border of a handbreadth around”</b> (Exodus 25:25). <b>Just as there,</b> the frame measures one <b>handbreadth, so too, here,</b> the thickness of the Ark cover measures a single <b>handbreadth.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive</b> the thickness of the Ark cover <b>from</b> the <b>vessels themselves,</b> the smallest of which measures a cubit. The Gemara answers: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> If there are two possible sources from which to derive the dimension of the Ark cover, then without conclusive proof one may not presume that the Torah intended to teach the larger dimension. Rather, the presumption is that the Torah is teaching the smaller dimension, which is included in the larger measure. |
| Exodus 25:29 | “And you shall make its dishes and its pans, uksotav umnakkiyyotav , | Menachot 97a:5 | § The mishna describes the shewbread Table (96a): <b>There were four panels of gold there,</b> which split up at their upper ends, above the Table, and there were twenty-eight rods that rested upon the panels. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ketina said: The verse states</b> with regard to the Table: <b>“And you shall make its dishes and its pans, <i>uksotav umnakkiyyotav</i>,</b> with which it shall be covered; of pure gold you shall make them” (Exodus 25:29). |
| Exodus 25:30 | always” | Chagigah 26b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that they would say to the <i>am ha’aretz</i> priests: <b>Be careful lest you touch the table,</b> as explained above, <b>or the candelabrum,</b> as the Gemara will explain. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> regarding <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>what is the reason he did not teach</b> that they were instructed not to touch the <b>candelabrum</b> as well? The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to the table it is written:</b> “Shewbread before Me <b>always”</b> (Exodus 25:30), indicating that the table holding the shewbread must always be in its place, whereas <b>with regard to the candelabrum it is not written “always,”</b> and therefore it can be removed for immersing. |
| Exodus 25:30 | “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread [ leḥem panim ] before Me always” | Menachot 96a:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The following letters are a mnemonic so <b>that you will not err</b> and forget the dimensions of the two loaves: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>dalet</i>.</b> The numerical value of the letter <i>zayin</i> is seven and the numerical value of the letter <i>dalet</i> is four. The mnemonic therefore represents the length of seven handbreadths, the width of four handbreadths, and the height of four fingerbreadths, respectively. The following letters are a mnemonic for the dimensions of the shewbread: <b><i>Yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>zayin</i>,</b> which stand for the length of ten handbreadths, the width of five handbreadths, and the height of seven fingerbreadths, respectively. <b>Ben Zoma says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall set upon the Table shewbread [<i>leḥem panim</i>] before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30). The term <b><i>leḥem panim</i></b> indicates <b>that it should have</b> vertical <b>sides [<i>panim</i>]</b> rather than a rounded shape. |
| Exodus 25:30 | before Me always” | Menachot 99b:11 | <b>Those bringing</b> the new shewbread <b>into</b> the Sanctuary <b>stand in the north and their faces are to the south, and those removing</b> the old shewbread <b>stand in the south and their faces are to the north. These</b> priests <b>draw</b> the old shewbread from the Table <b>and those</b> priests <b>place</b> the new shewbread on the Table, <b>and for</b> each <b>handbreadth of this</b> old shewbread that is removed from the Table a <b>handbreadth of that</b> new shewbread is placed upon the Table, so that the Table is never without loaves upon it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread <b>before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30). |
| Exodus 25:30 | before Me always” | Menachot 99b:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yosei, even if the priest first removes the old shewbread entirely, and only then places the new shewbread upon the Table, this fulfills the requirement that the shewbread always be on the Table. Moreover, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if the priest <b>removed the old</b> shewbread on the <b>morning</b> of Shabbat, <b>and arranged the new</b> shewbread toward <b>evening,</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that. Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread <b>before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30)? This means <b>that</b> the <b>Table should not be left overnight without bread</b> upon it. |
| Exodus 25:30 | before Me continuously” | Shabbat 133b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> the Sages of <b>Neharde’a say:</b> This ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who disagree</b> with <b>Rabbi Yosei. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Four priests would enter</b> the Sanctuary every Shabbat to arrange the showbread, <b>two</b> of whom <b>had two orders</b> of six loaves each <b>in their hands, and two had two bowls</b> of frankincense <b>in their hands. And four</b> priests <b>would precede them; two</b> came <b>to take</b> the <b>two orders</b> of bread left on the table from the previous week, <b>and two</b> came <b>to take</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense. Next, <b>those bringing</b> the loaves and bowls <b>into</b> the Sanctuary <b>would stand in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>facing south, while those carrying</b> the loaves and bowls <b>out would stand in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>facing north. These slide</b> the old bread along the table, <b>and these place</b> the new bread on the table, and as a result, <b>the handbreadth of this one would be alongside the handbreadth of that one,</b> so that the requisite amount of bread would always be present on the table, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall place on the table showbread <b>before Me continuously”</b> (Exodus 25:30). |
| Exodus 25:31 | be made” | Menachot 28a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work <b>will</b> the Candelabrum <b>be made”</b> (Exodus 25:31), <b>to include other types of metal.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the expression “will be made” serves <b>to include</b> a Candelabrum fashioned from <b>fragments</b> of gold? The Gemara answers: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as</b> the term of <b>being,</b> which indicates an indispensable requirement, <b>is written with regard to</b> the command that the Candelabrum be <b>a beaten work,</b> i.e., fashioned from a single block and not from different fragments, as it is stated: “Shall be of one beaten work” (Exodus 25:36). |
| Exodus 25:31 | a beaten work, | Menachot 28a:11 | The Gemara challenges: But the term <b>“will be made” is also written with regard to</b> the command that the Candelabrum be <b>a beaten work,</b> as it is written: “Of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31). The Gemara answers: The term <b>“beaten work”</b> appears in Exodus 25:31, and the term <b>“beaten work”</b> appears again in Exodus 25:36, <b>to</b> demonstrate that this requirement is <b>indispensable.</b> |
| Exodus 25:31 | its goblets, its knobs, and its flowers” | Menachot 28a:14 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>What interpretation</b> is referenced above? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold will it be made, with all these vessels”</b> (Exodus 25:39); this verse teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold,</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent;</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent.</b> Similarly, the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work shall the Candelabrum be made, even its base, its shaft, <b>its goblets, its knobs, and its flowers”</b> (Exodus 25:31), teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers,</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers.</b> |
| Exodus 25:31 | Sage interpret | Menachot 28b:5 | Rav Yosef <b>said to him: What,</b> in <b>your opinion,</b> is the explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? Rav Pappa, son of Rav Ḥanin, <b>said to him: Both</b> this <b>Sage and</b> that <b>Sage interpret</b> the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The verse begins with a generalization: “And you will make a Candelabrum,” followed by a detail: “Of pure gold,” which is then followed by a generalization: “Will the Candelabrum be made.” According to the hermeneutic principle of generalizations and details, this teaches that any item that is similar to the detail is also deemed fit. |
| Exodus 25:31 | interprets | Menachot 28b:8 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details. “And you will make a Candelabrum of”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as the material of the Candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; and by then stating: <b>“Of beaten work will the Candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>then makes a generalization.</b> The result is <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization,</b> from which <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail,</b> leading to this conclusion: <b>Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined</b> as a type <b>of metal, so too, all</b> other types <b>of metal</b> may be used in fashioning the Candelabrum. |
| Exodus 25:31 | interprets | Sukkah 50b:6 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> the verse “And you shall make a candelabrum of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details. “And you shall make a candelabrum of,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as the material of the candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold,”</b> that is <b>a detail,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; <b>“of beaten work shall the candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>then generalized</b> again. The result is <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization,</b> from which <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>that are similar to the detail; just as the detail is explicit</b> that the candelabrum is crafted <b>from</b> gold, which is <b>a metal, so too all</b> other materials used in crafting the candelabrum must be <b>of metal.</b> The candelabrum is a prototype for all other Temple service vessels. |
| Exodus 25:33 | and it is written: “Three goblets made like almond blossoms in one branch, a knob, and a flower; | Menachot 28b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> there were <b>twenty-two goblets</b> on the Candelabrum, <b>as it is written: “And in the Candelabrum four goblets</b> made like almond blossoms” (Exodus 25:34), <b>and it is written: “Three goblets made like almond blossoms in one branch, a knob, and a flower;</b> and three goblets made like almond blossoms in the other branch, a knob, and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the Candelabrum” (Exodus 25:33).

| Exodus 25:33 | branches, | Menachot 29a:1 | <b>and</b> the <b>eighteen of the</b> six <b>branches; this</b> equals <b>twenty-two</b> goblets.

In addition to these eight knobs, the verse states: <b>“And a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it, <b>and a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it, <b>and a knob</b> under two branches of one piece with it” (Exodus 25:35); <b>this</b> equals <b>eleven</b> knobs. |
| Exodus 25:33 | branches, | Menachot 29a:2 | <b>But from where do we</b> derive that the Candelabrum contained <b>nine flowers?</b> According to the verse there are the <b>two flowers of its</b> main shaft, as it is written: “And its flowers” (Exodus 25:34), <b>and the six of</b> the six <b>branches,</b> as it is written: “In one branch, a knob and a flower” (Exodus 25:33), meaning that <b>there are eight,</b> not nine, flowers on the Candelabrum. <b>Rav Shalman said</b> in response: <b>It is written: “It was a beaten work, from the base to the flower”</b> (Numbers 8:4), which teaches that there was a ninth flower near the base. |

| Exodus 25:34 | “ Meshukkadim ” | Yoma 52b:2 | The second uncertain case is the term: <b>“<i>Meshukkadim</i>”</b> (Exodus 25:34). This verse can be read: “And in the candelabrum four cups made like almond blossoms [<i>meshukkadim</i>]”; or as: “Its knops and its flowers made like almond blossoms [<i>meshukkadim</i>].” In other words, the term <i>meshukkadim</i> can be read either with the first part or the last part of the verse. |
| Exodus 25:35 | and a knob | Menachot 29a:1 | <b>and</b> the <b>eighteen of the</b> six <b>branches; this</b> equals <b>twenty-two</b> goblets.

| Exodus 25:36 | a beaten work, | Menachot 28a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work <b>will</b> the Candelabrum <b>be made”</b> (Exodus 25:31), <b>to include other types of metal.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the expression “will be made” serves <b>to include</b> a Candelabrum fashioned from <b>fragments</b> of gold? The Gemara answers: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as</b> the term of <b>being,</b> which indicates an indispensable requirement, <b>is written with regard to</b> the command that the Candelabrum be <b>a beaten work,</b> i.e., fashioned from a single block and not from different fragments, as it is stated: “Shall be of one beaten work” (Exodus 25:36). |
| Exodus 25:36 | being: | Menachot 28a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the absence of any of the seven branches of the Candelabrum prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written concerning them</b> a term of <b>being:</b> “Their knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with it” (Exodus 25:36), and a term of being indicates an indispensable requirement. |
| Exodus 25:36 | unfit? As it is written | Menachot 28a:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i> 1:18): The <b>Candelabrum was fashioned from</b> a complete <b>block [<i>ha’eshet</i>] and from gold.</b> If they <b>fashioned it from fragments [<i>hagerutaot</i>]</b> of gold then it is <b>unfit,</b> but if they fashioned it <b>from other types of metal</b> rather than gold, it is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>different</b> about a Candelabrum made <b>from fragments</b> of gold, that it is rendered <b>unfit? As it is written</b> with regard to it: “Their knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold” (Exodus 25:36), employing the term <b>“beaten [<i>miksha</i>]” and</b> a term of <b>being,</b> indicating that it is an indispensable requirement. But accordingly, a Candelabrum fashioned from <b>other types of metal</b> should be rendered unfit <b>as well,</b> since the verse states that it is made from <b>gold and</b> uses a term of <b>being.</b> |
| Exodus 25:39 | “Of a talent of pure gold will it be made, with all these vessels” | Menachot 28a:14 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>What interpretation</b> is referenced above? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold will it be made, with all these vessels”</b> (Exodus 25:39); this verse teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold,</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent;</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with the precise weight of <b>a talent.</b> Similarly, the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work shall the Candelabrum be made, even its base, its shaft, <b>its goblets, its knobs, and its flowers”</b> (Exodus 25:31), teaches that if the Candelabrum is <b>fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> it must be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers,</b> and if it is <b>not fashioned</b> of <b>gold</b> but of other types of metal, then it does <b>not</b> need to be <b>fashioned</b> with <b>goblets, knobs, and flowers.</b> |
| Exodus 25:39 | talent | Menachot 29a:5 | § <b>It is written: “And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold [<i>mikhlot zahav</i>]”</b> (II Chronicles 4:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b><i>mikhlot zahav</i>? Rav Ami says:</b> It is a reference to the fact <b>that</b> the Candelabrum and its vessels <b>exhausted [<i>kilattu</i>] all of Solomon’s pure [<i>sagur</i>] gold [<i>zahav</i>],</b> which was used in its fashioning in such great quantities. <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav said: Solomon made ten Candelabrums, and for each and every one he brought one thousand talents of gold, and they placed</b> the gold <b>in the furnace</b> to refine it <b>one thousand times, until they reduced</b> the gold <b>to</b> one <b>talent</b> for each Candelabrum, as it is stated: “Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made” (Exodus 25:39). |
| Exodus 25:39 | “Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned | Menachot 88b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the exposition of <b>this verse, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned</b> with all these vessels” (Exodus 25:39), <b>we learned about the</b> frame of the <b>Candelabrum that</b> it <b>is produced from the</b> gold <b>talent. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include its lamps,</b> that they should also be fashioned together with the frame from the same talent? <b>The verse states:</b> “It shall be fashioned <b>with all these vessels.”</b> This indicates that not only the frame, but also additional parts should be fashioned from the same talent. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even its tongs and its pans.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “It</b> shall be fashioned.” The additional word “it” teaches that only the frame and the lamps are to be fashioned from the gold talent. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Neḥemya.</b> |
| Exodus 25:40 | “And see that you make them after their pattern, which is being shown to you in the mount” | Menachot 29a:12 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: An Ark of fire and a Table of fire and a Candelabrum of fire descended from the Heavens, and Moses saw</b> their format <b>and fashioned</b> the vessels for the Tabernacle <b>in their likeness. As it is stated</b> after the command to fashion these items: <b>“And see that you make them after their pattern, which is being shown to you in the mount”</b> (Exodus 25:40). |
| Exodus 26:7 | “Eleven [ ashtei esrei ] curtains” | Sanhedrin 29a:36 | <b>Rav Ashi says</b> another example: In the verse: <b>“Eleven [<i>ashtei esrei</i>] curtains”</b> (Exodus 26:7), without the letter <i>ayin</i> at the beginning of the phrase it would read <i>shtei esrei</i>, twelve. Therefore, the additional letter <i>ayin</i> reduces the amount from twelve to eleven. |
| Exodus 26:9 | as it is written: “And you shall double the sixth curtain over the front of the tent” | Shabbat 98b:9 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states, <b>“And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side of what remains</b> of the length of the curtains of the tent shall hang over the sides of the Tabernacle, on this side and on that side to cover it” (Exodus 26:13). What remains of the length of the curtains is <b>to cover the cubit of the sockets;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> It is <b>to cover the cubit of the beams. Place their width across the length</b> of the <b>Tabernacle. How much was</b> their width? It was <b>forty-four</b> cubits. <b>Subtract thirty for the roof,</b> and <b>fourteen remain. Subtract two for the doubling</b> of the sixth curtain, <b>as it is written: “And you shall double the sixth curtain over the front of the tent”</b> (Exodus 26:9), and <b>twelve remain.</b> |
| Exodus 26:12 | the half curtain that remained shall hang | Shabbat 98b:10 | <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the beams narrowed to a fingerbreadth, and therefore the top of the beams did not take up any of the width of the curtains, which enabled the curtain to cover the entire wall of the Tabernacle with part of the curtain on the ground, it is understandable why <b>it is written:</b> “And as for the overhanging part that remained from the curtains of the tent, <b>the half curtain that remained shall hang</b> over the back of the Tabernacle” (Exodus 26:12). <b>However,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who maintains that it is necessary for the width of the curtains to cover the thickness at the top of the beams, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>shall hang?</b> The Gemara answers: It means that <b>it will hang more than the others.</b> In his opinion, this curtain is two cubits longer than the other curtains covering the Tabernacle. With regard to this, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: To what is the Tabernacle similar?</b> It is similar <b>to a woman walking in the marketplace with her skirts following after her.</b> |
| Exodus 26:13 | “And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side of what remains | Shabbat 98b:9 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states, <b>“And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side of what remains</b> of the length of the curtains of the tent shall hang over the sides of the Tabernacle, on this side and on that side to cover it” (Exodus 26:13). What remains of the length of the curtains is <b>to cover the cubit of the sockets;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> It is <b>to cover the cubit of the beams. Place their width across the length</b> of the <b>Tabernacle. How much was</b> their width? It was <b>forty-four</b> cubits. <b>Subtract thirty for the roof,</b> and <b>fourteen remain. Subtract two for the doubling</b> of the sixth curtain, <b>as it is written: “And you shall double the sixth curtain over the front of the tent”</b> (Exodus 26:9), and <b>twelve remain.</b> |
| Exodus 26:14 | “And you shall make a covering for the tent | Shabbat 28a:2 | <b>And</b> perhaps <b>say: Just as below,</b> in the Tabernacle, there were <b>beams</b> supporting the tent, <b>so too, here,</b> in the laws of ritual impurity, a tent made of <b>beams</b> should also be considered a tent. The Gemara responds that <b>the verse said: “And you shall make the beams for the Tabernacle</b> of acacia wood, standing up” (Exodus 26:15). From the language of the verse, it is derived that the <b>Tabernacle,</b> i.e., the curtains alone, is <b>called Tabernacle, and</b> the <b>beams are not called Tabernacle,</b> because they merely facilitate the Tabernacle. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But if that is so,</b> based on an analysis of the language of the verse, it says there: <b>“And you shall make a covering for the tent</b> of rams’ skins dyed red and a covering of <i>teḥashim</i> above” (Exodus 26:14), then in <b>that</b> case, <b>too,</b> say that <b>the covering is not considered a tent.</b> If so, <b>however,</b> what of <b>the dilemma raised by Rabbi Elazar:</b> With regard to <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> over a corpse, <b>what is</b> the ruling? <b>Can</b> it <b>become ritually impure as a tent over a corpse?</b> If the covering of the Tabernacle is not considered a tent, <b>now, the hide of a kosher animal</b> that covered the Tabernacle <b>cannot become ritually impure.</b> If that is so, <b>is it necessary to mention that the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> cannot become ritually impure? The Gemara answers: The cases are not comparable because <b>it is different there,</b> in the case of the covering of animal hides, <b>because the verse subsequently restored</b> its status as a tent by uniting the tent and its covering, <b>as it is written: “They shall bear the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tent of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of <i>taḥash</i> that is upon it”</b> (Numbers 4:25). The verse <b>juxtaposes the upper to the lower</b> covering; <b>just as</b> the <b>lower</b> covering <b>is considered a tent, so too,</b> the <b>upper</b> covering <b>is considered a tent.</b> |

| Exodus 26:15 | “Acacia wood, standing” | Sukkah 45b:2 | § Apropos the <i>halakha</i> cited by Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, the Gemara cites additional <i>halakhot</i>. <b>Ḥizkiya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>all</b> objects used in performance of <b>each and every</b> one of <b>the mitzvot, a person fulfills his obligation only</b> when the objects are positioned <b>in the manner of their growth.</b> One must take the <i>lulav</i> with the bottom of the branch facing down, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the beams of the Tabernacle: <b>“Acacia wood, standing”</b> (Exodus 26:15), indicating that the beams stood in the manner of their growth. |
| Exodus 26:15 | acacia wood, standing” | Yoma 72a:12 | The Gemara cites other statements concerning the ark. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall make the boards for the Tabernacle of <b>acacia wood, standing”</b> (Exodus 26:15)? This verse teaches <b>that</b> the boards of wood used for the Tabernacle should <b>stand in the</b> same <b>direction in which they grew</b> from the ground as a tree. <b>Alternatively, “standing”</b> means <b>that they supported their</b> gold <b>plating</b> and prevented it from falling. <b>Alternatively, “standing”</b> is written to hint at the following: <b>Perhaps you will say</b> that now that the Tabernacle is no longer in use, <b>their hope is lost and their chance is abandoned,</b> and after being stored away the boards will no longer return to use. Therefore, <b>the verse states “standing”</b> to indicate <b>that they stand forever and ever.</b> |
| Exodus 26:16 | “Ten ammot shall be the length of a board” | Bekhorot 44a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says: Moses, our teacher, was ten <i>ammot</i></b> tall, <b>as it is stated: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19). <b>Who spread</b> the tent over the Tabernacle? <b>Moses, our teacher, spread it, and it is written</b> with regard to the height of the Tabernacle: <b>“Ten <i>ammot</i> shall be the length of a board”</b> (Exodus 26:16). Moses must have been at least as tall as the Tabernacle itself for him to have spread the tent over it. |
| Exodus 26:16 | And it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, | Nedarim 38a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence only upon</b> one who is <b>mighty, and wealthy, and wise, and humble. And all of these</b> qualities are derived <b>from Moses.</b> He was <b>mighty, as it is written: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19), <b>and the Master said: Moses, our teacher, spread it</b> himself. <b>And it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a board,</b> and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board” (Exodus 26:16). Moses was tall and strong enough to spread the tent over the boards alone. The Gemara asks: <b>Say that he was tall and thin,</b> and the fact that he was mighty cannot be derived. |
| Exodus 26:16 | ten cubits, as it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a beam” | Sukkah 5b:9 | And to calculate: <b>How many</b> cubits high <b>was the Tabernacle?</b> It was <b>ten cubits, as it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a beam”</b> (Exodus 26:16). <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>do these</b> ten cubits contain? They contain <b>sixty handbreadths. And one third of that</b> total <b>is how many?</b> It is <b>twenty handbreadths. Subtract</b> from this figure <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>of the Ark and the Ark cover</b> upon which the cherubs stood, and <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>remain,</b> which was the height of each individual cherub. <b>And it is written: “And the cherubs shall spread out their wings upward, screening [<i>sokhekhim</i>] the Ark cover with their wings”</b> (Exodus 25:20). Here <b>the Merciful One is referring to</b> the wings using the terminology of <b>roofing [<i>sekhakha</i>]</b> specifically <b>when</b> they are <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>above</b> the Ark cover. This is a source that the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is placed at least ten handbreadths high. |
| Exodus 26:24 | they will be ended [ tamim ] at the top | Shabbat 98b:2 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> The Tabernacle <b>beams were one cubit thick at the bottom,</b> and <b>they narrowed to a fingerbreadth as they reached the top, as it is stated:</b> “And they shall match at the bottom, and together <b>they will be ended [<i>tamim</i>] at the top</b> toward a single ring; so shall it be for them both, they shall form the two corners” (Exodus 26:24). <b>And below,</b> when the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River, <b>it says:</b> “And those who went down toward the Sea of Arava at the Dead Sea <b>came to an end [<i>tamu</i>]”</b> (Joshua 3:16). <i>Tam</i> means finished or terminated. Here, too, the beams narrowed as they reached the top until they were virtually terminated; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Just as they were one cubit thick at the bottom, so too, they were one cubit thick at the top, as it is stated: Together.</b> |
| Exodus 26:28 | “And the middle bar in the midst of the beams | Shabbat 98b:5 | Following the dispute over the Tabernacle beams, the Gemara interprets other verses according to the two positions. It is written: <b>“And the middle bar in the midst of the beams</b> shall pass through from end to end” (Exodus 26:28). One of the Sages <b>taught:</b> It <b>stood by</b> means of <b>a miracle,</b> as this verse indicates that the middle bar was a single rod that ran along the length and width of the Tabernacle. The middle bar was miraculously bent through the beams on three sides. |
| Exodus 26:30 | “And you shall set up the Tabernacle according to its fashion which has been shown to you in the mount” | Menachot 29a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> is that to say that the verse: <b>“And you shall set up the Tabernacle according to its fashion which has been shown to you in the mount”</b> (Exodus 26:30), <b>also</b> indicates that God showed Moses a Tabernacle of fire? The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, <b>it is written: “According to its fashion,”</b> meaning that it should be built according to the instructions given to Moses, whereas <b>there,</b> with regard to the Ark, Table, and Candelabrum, <b>it is written: “After their pattern,”</b> indicating that an actual model of the items was shown to Moses. |
| Exodus 26:31 | “work of a designer” | Yoma 72b:18 | The Gemara returns to its discussion concerning the sacred vessels: The verse states with regard to the covers for the Tabernacle that they are <b>“work of an embroiderer”</b> (Exodus 26:36), and it also states they are <b>“work of a designer”</b> (Exodus 26:31). How can both descriptions be reconciled? <b>Rabbi Elazar said: They embroidered the place where they had designed.</b> They first marked a design on the material in paint, and then they embroidered it. |
| Exodus 26:33 | holy place,” as it is stated: “And the Curtain shall divide for you between the holy place and the Holy of Holies” | Menachot 27b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> understands: <b>If the Merciful One had written</b> only that it is prohibited to come <b>“into the holy place” and did not write “within the Curtain,” I would say: What</b> is the <b>holy place?</b> It is <b>within the Curtain,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, and one who enters it violates a prohibition, <b>but</b> if one enters the <b>Sanctuary</b> he does <b>not even</b> violate <b>a prohibition. And the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim: <b>You cannot say that, as the entire Sanctuary is called</b> “the <b>holy place,” as it is stated: “And the Curtain shall divide for you between the holy place and the Holy of Holies”</b> (Exodus 26:33). |
| Exodus 26:33 | cubit. Rabbi Yosei says: There was only one curtain there, as it is stated: “And the curtain shall divide for you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies” | Yoma 51b:5 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <b>would</b> then <b>walk</b> west <b>through the Sanctuary until he reaches</b> the area <b>between the two curtains that separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, and</b> the space <b>between them</b> was one <b>cubit. Rabbi Yosei says: There was only one curtain there, as it is stated: “And the curtain shall divide for you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies”</b> (Exodus 26:33). |
| Exodus 26:35 | and the candelabrum opposite the table” | Chagigah 26b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> regarding <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, in the <i>baraita</i>, why does he include the candelabrum? The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is written: “And</b> you shall set the table without the veil <b>and the candelabrum opposite the table”</b> (Exodus 26:35), indicating that the candelabrum must always be placed opposite the table; <b>it is as though it is written “always” with regard to</b> the candelabrum as well. <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, in the mishna, who does not object to removing the candelabrum for immersion, would reply: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes</b> only <b>to establish a place for</b> the candelabrum, to describe where it must be positioned, but it does not mean to say that it must be opposite the table at all times. |
| Exodus 26:35 | But the Torah said: “And you shall put the Table on the north side” | Menachot 98b:5 | <b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, which was in the center of the eastern wall, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> tables <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> tables <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south of the Sanctuary. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five tables to the left of the entrance, the <b>table</b> was placed <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said: “And you shall put the Table on the north side”</b> (Exodus 26:35). |
| Exodus 26:35 | and the Candelabrum opposite the Table | Menachot 98b:8 | <b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> candelabra <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> candelabra <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south side. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five candelabra to the right of the entrance, the <b>candelabrum</b> was placed <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said:</b> “And you shall set the Table outside the Curtain, <b>and the Candelabrum opposite the Table</b> on the side of the Tabernacle toward the south, and you shall put the Table on the north side” (Exodus 26:35). |
| Exodus 26:35 | because it is written: “And the candelabrum opposite the table” | Yoma 33b:1 | <b>And when</b> he <b>enters the Sanctuary</b> it is <b>the altar</b> that <b>he encounters first,</b> before reaching the candelabrum; therefore, he performs the service of the altar before removing the ashes from the lamps, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>table</b> stood <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>removed two and a half cubits from the wall. And</b> the <b>candelabrum</b> stood <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>removed two and a half cubits from the wall. The altar was centered and standing in the middle</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>removed a bit outward.</b> Therefore, one encounters the altar first. The Gemara questions the essence of the matter: <b>And let us stand</b> the altar <b>alongside</b> the table and the candelabrum; why was it removed outward? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because it is written: “And the candelabrum opposite the table”</b> (Exodus 26:35); <b>we require that they are visible to each other.</b> Were the altar aligned with the table and the candelabrum, it would interpose between them. |
| Exodus 26:36 | “work of an embroiderer” | Yoma 72b:18 | The Gemara returns to its discussion concerning the sacred vessels: The verse states with regard to the covers for the Tabernacle that they are <b>“work of an embroiderer”</b> (Exodus 26:36), and it also states they are <b>“work of a designer”</b> (Exodus 26:31). How can both descriptions be reconciled? <b>Rabbi Elazar said: They embroidered the place where they had designed.</b> They first marked a design on the material in paint, and then they embroidered it. |
| Exodus 27:1 | ten cubits high. | Shabbat 92a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who carries out a load</b> from the private domain to the public domain, even if he does so at a height <b>above ten handbreadths,</b> which is beyond the parameters of the public domain, <b>he is liable, as</b> this was the method of <b>carrying</b> utilized <b>by the sons of Kehat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the method of <b>carrying</b> utilized <b>by the sons of Kehat</b> was above ten handbreadths? The Gemara answers: <b>For it is written</b> about the Levites’ carrying: “And the hangings of the courtyard, and the screen for the courtyard entrance which <b>surrounds the Tabernacle, and the altar,</b> and its cords for all of its service” (Numbers 3:26). This verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>altar to the Tabernacle.</b> It is derived that <b>just as the Tabernacle</b> was <b>ten cubits</b> high, <b>so too,</b> the <b>altar</b> was <b>ten cubits high.</b> The verse that indicates otherwise: “And you shall make the altar…and its height should be three cubits” (Exodus 27:1), must be understood differently. |
| Exodus 27:1 | “Five cubits long and five cubits wide” | Zevachim 59b:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this claim? <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying well,</b> i.e., his claim is persuasive. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that <b>the altar that Moses built was large. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Five cubits long and five cubits wide”</b> (Exodus 27:1). <b>The matters</b> in the verse are to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> |
| Exodus 27:1 | “Square” | Zevachim 59b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is stated here</b> that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), <b>and it is stated there,</b> in Ezekiel’s prophetic description of the altar, that it is: <b>“Square”</b> (Ezekiel 43:16). <b>Just as there,</b> in Ezekiel’s vision, <b>he was measuring</b> the distance in each direction <b>from its center, so too here,</b> the verse <b>was measuring</b> the altar that Moses built <b>from its center.</b> Accordingly, the altar built by Moses was ten cubits by ten cubits. As a result, Solomon sacrificed more offerings per square cubit of space on the altar in the Temple than he did on the altar built by Moses. It is therefore possible that the altar in the Temple was not sufficient to accommodate the offerings, and Solomon consecrated the Temple courtyard to serve as an altar. |
| Exodus 27:1 | “And its height shall be three cubits” | Zevachim 59b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> respond to Rabbi Yehuda’s claim? The Gemara answers: <b>When he learns the verbal analogy, he learns it with regard to</b> the altar’s <b>height. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the altar built in the time of Moses: <b>“And its height shall be three cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:1). The <b>matters</b> in the verse are to be understood <b>as they are written,</b> i.e., that the height of the altar was three cubits. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Exodus 27:1 | “Square” | Zevachim 59b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: It is stated here</b> that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> that the incense altar was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 30:2). The verbal analogy indicates that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the incense altar, <b>its height</b> was <b>twice its length, so too here,</b> the height of the altar built in the time of Moses was <b>twice its length,</b> i.e., ten cubits. |
| Exodus 27:1 | and its height shall be three cubits” | Zevachim 60a:2 | Rabbi Yosei continues: <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall make the altar…<b>and its height shall be three cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:1)? The verse means that the altar measures three cubits <b>from the edge of</b> the <b>surrounding ledge and above.</b> |
| Exodus 27:1 | “Five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square” | Zevachim 62a:13 | It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> cited above that <b>the measurement of</b> the altar’s <b>length, and the measurement of its width, and the measurement of its height are not indispensable. Rabbi Mani says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that one does not decrease its</b> size so that it is smaller <b>than</b> the <b>altar constructed by Moses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> large was the altar constructed by Moses? <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> One <b>cubit.</b> Those in the study hall <b>mocked</b> Rav Yosef, as it is written explicitly: <b>“Five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square”</b> (Exodus 27:1). |
| Exodus 27:1 | “Square” | Zevachim 62b:14 | § The Gemara continues discussing the ramp: <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> There were <b>two small ramps protruding from the</b> main <b>ramp</b> that led to the altar, <b>on which</b> the priests could <b>turn to the base</b> of the altar <b>and to the surrounding ledge</b> of the altar. They were <b>separated from the altar</b> by <b>a hairbreadth, because it is stated: “Roundabout”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), with regard to the altar. This indicates that nothing is attached to the entire perimeter of the altar. <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says</b> there is a different source, as it states: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), and if the ramps would be connected to the altar it would no longer be square. |
| Exodus 27:1 | “square [ ravua ]” | Zevachim 62b:6 | Rava <b>said</b> back <b>to him: It is written</b> in a verse that the altar must be <b>“square [<i>ravua</i>]”</b> (Exodus 27:1), which indicates lying down or crouching, as it is similar to the term <i>ravutz</i>, meaning crouching. Abaye challenges Rava: <b>But</b> this word is <b>necessary to</b> teach <b>that</b> the altar must be <b>square.</b> Rava responds: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b>square [<i>merubba</i>]?</b> The verse specifically uses the form <i>ravua</i> in order to allude to the word <i>ravutz</i>, crouching. Abaye counters: <b>According to your reasoning, is it written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b><i>ravutz</i>?</b> Rava answers: It <b>is written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b><i>ravua</i>, which</b> is a term that <b>indicates this,</b> i.e., that the altar must be square, <b>and indicates that,</b> i.e., that its positioning is comparable to that of a person who is lying down. |
| Exodus 27:5 | as it is written: “And the net may reach halfway up the altar” | Zevachim 119b:20 | <b>A partition for</b> the <b>blood,</b> i.e., the red line that divides the altar, as the blood of some offerings, e.g., a sin offering, was sprinkled above the line, and the blood of other offerings, e.g., a burnt offering, was sprinkled below the line, was required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the net may reach halfway up the altar”</b> (Exodus 27:5). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applied only to the altar in the Tabernacle. With regard to the requirement for <b>washing of hands</b> and feet before the service, it is required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written:</b> “When they went into the Tent of Meeting <b>and when they came near to the altar, they shall wash”</b> (Exodus 40:32). |
| Exodus 27:5 | and the net will reach halfway up the altar” | Zevachim 53a:9 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 35b): <b>A red line circumscribed</b> the altar <b>in the middle, to separate between</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the upper</b> part of the altar <b>and</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the lower</b> part of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ketina said</b> it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, <b>and the net will reach halfway up the altar”</b> (Exodus 27:5). <b>The Torah provided</b> for <b>a separation</b> on the altar, <b>to separate between</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> placed on <b>the upper</b> part of the altar <b>and</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> placed on <b>the lower</b> part of the altar. |
| Exodus 27:5 | also be indispensable, as it is written: “And you shall put it under the karkov of the altar beneath” | Zevachim 62a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then the <b>engraving [<i>kiyyur</i>]</b> that was on the altar <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>or</b> the <b>surrounding ledge</b> of the altar <b>according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> should <b>also be indispensable, as it is written: “And you shall put it under the <i>karkov</i> of the altar beneath”</b> (Exodus 27:5). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>karkov</i>? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: This is</b> the <b>engraving</b> on the altar. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: This is the surrounding ledge.</b> |
| Exodus 27:7 | it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings” | Yoma 72a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be removed from it”</b> (Exodus 25:15), implying the staves should remain there permanently. But in another verse <b>it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings”</b> (Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. <b>How is this</b> contradiction resolved? The staves <b>could be removed</b> from their position, i.e., they were loosened, but <b>did not come out.</b> The staves were wider at their ends and thinner in the middle. Therefore, once they had been forced into the rings, although they could be shifted, they would not be removed entirely. |
| Exodus 27:7 | the verse states: “And its staves shall be put into the rings” | Yoma 72a:11 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark;</b> they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they should not move from their place</b> at all; therefore; <b>the verse states: “And its staves shall be put into the rings”</b> (Exodus 27:7). <b>If</b> it had stated: <b>And its staves shall be put,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they are inserted and removed</b> entirely; therefore, <b>the verse states: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark;</b> they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). <b>How is this? They could be removed</b> from their position, but <b>did not come out.</b> |
| Exodus 27:8 | “ Nevuv luḥot ” | Bava Batra12b:7 | Having already cited one statement of Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa, the Gemara cites another statement in his name: <b>Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa says: Before a person eats and drinks he has two hearts,</b> meaning his heart is unsettled because he is distracted by hunger. But <b>after he eats and drinks he has only one heart, as it is stated: “A hollow [<i>nevuv</i>] man is two-hearted”</b> (Job 11:12). How is it indicated that “<i>nevuv</i>” means hungry? <b>As it is written</b> concerning the altar: <b>“<i>Nevuv luḥot</i>”</b> (Exodus 27:8), <b>which we translate</b> into Aramaic as: <b>Hollow with planks,</b> meaning that a hollow person, i.e., one who has not yet eaten, is two-hearted. |
| Exodus 27:10 | “The hooks of [ vavei ] the poles” | Sanhedrin 22a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Perata, who said in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i: This script did not change at all, as it is stated</b> with regard to the construction of the Tabernacle: <b>“The hooks of [<i>vavei</i>] the poles”</b> (Exodus 27:10). This teaches that <b>just as the poles were not changed, so too, the hooks [<i>vavim</i>] were not changed.</b> The letter <i>vav</i> in <i>Ashurit</i> script has the shape of a hook. Evidently, this is why the term for hook in the Torah is <i>vav</i>. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “And to the Jews according to their script and according to their language”</b> (Esther 8:9). This teaches that <b>just as their language was not changed</b> over the generations but remained Hebrew, <b>so too, their script was not changed.</b> |
| Exodus 27:14 | And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits; | Eruvin 2b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive</b> the maximum width of a doorway <b>from the doorway of the gate of the courtyard</b> of the Tabernacle. <b>As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <b>And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> is considered a doorway, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruv</i>, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> should be considered a doorway. |
| Exodus 27:18 | stated: “The length of the courtyard shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty, | Eruvin 23b:5 | The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is learned from <b>the verse</b> that <b>stated: “The length of the courtyard shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty,</b> and the height, five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass” (Exodus 27:18). <b>The Torah said: Take</b> a square of <b>fifty</b> cubits by fifty cubits, <b>and surround</b> it with the remaining <b>fifty</b> cubits until they form a square, each side of which measures seventy cubits and a remainder. |
| Exodus 27:18 | As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits” | Eruvin 2b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive</b> the maximum width of a doorway <b>from the doorway of the gate of the courtyard</b> of the Tabernacle. <b>As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <b>And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> is considered a doorway, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruv</i>, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> should be considered a doorway. |
| Exodus 27:18 | the verse states: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty” | Eruvin 58a:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the Shabbat limit must be measured with a rope fifty cubits long, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They are derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>The Torah states: Measure with a rope of fifty cubits,</b> i.e., the length and breadth of the courtyard must be measured “by fifty,” with a rope fifty cubits long. |
| Exodus 27:18 | the court shall be a hundred cubits…and the height five cubits” | Zevachim 59b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>But isn’t it already stated:</b> “The length of <b>the court shall be a hundred cubits…and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18)? Is it <b>possible</b> that the <b>priest</b> would <b>stand atop the altar and</b> hold the items with which he would perform the sacrificial <b>service in his hand, and the whole nation</b> could <b>see him from outside</b> the courtyard? That would constitute a lack of respect for the service in the Tabernacle. |
| Exodus 27:18 | five cubits” | Zevachim 60a:1 | <b>cubits for the one side”</b> (Exodus 38:14), which indicates that the height of the curtains surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle was fifteen cubits. <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And the height <b>five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18)? It is referring to the height of the curtains <b>from the</b> upper <b>edge of the altar and above;</b> the curtains surrounding the courtyard were five cubits higher than the altar. |
| Exodus 27:20 | One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Exodus 27:20 | oil of an olive” | Menachot 86a:21 | The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to this dilemma from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states that the olive oil used for the kindling of the Candelabrum is to be: “Refined <b>oil of an olive”</b> (Exodus 27:20), which is interpreted to mean that the olives should be so ripe that the oil drips <b>from</b> them while they are still hanging on <b>their olive tree,</b> without them needing to be pressed. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that for the <b>first olive</b> harvest, <b>one allows</b> all the olives <b>to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>],</b> picks the entire crop <b>and brings it into the olive press, and</b> he <b>grinds it with a millstone and places it in</b> wicker <b>baskets, and this oil that would flow from it would be</b> the <b>first</b> grade of oil. |
| Exodus 27:20 | to cause a lamp to burn continually” | Shabbat 21a:9 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: Those <b>wicks and oils, which the Sages said one may not light with them on Shabbat, one may not light</b> with them <b>in the Temple</b> either <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the Temple candelabrum: “And you shall command the children of Israel, that they bring unto you pure olive oil beaten for the light, <b>to cause a lamp to burn continually”</b> (Exodus 27:20). Rami bar Ḥama <b>taught that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and he</b> also <b>said its</b> explanation: What is the proof from the verse? One may interpret the verse homiletically: The requirement is to light the candelabrum <b>so that the flame ascends of itself</b> when it is kindled, <b>and not that it ascends by means of something else,</b> i.e., adjusting the wick after it was lit. |
| Exodus 27:20 | “perpetual fire” that I told you, | Yoma 45b:7 | Since there are two equally logical derivations, a verse is required to teach the <i>halakha</i>. <b>The verse states: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out”</b> (Leviticus 6:6). The <b>“perpetual fire” that I told you,</b> i.e., the fire of the candelabrum, about which the Torah states “a lamp to burn continually” (Exodus 27:20), <b>should</b> be lit <b>only</b> from a fire that is <b>upon the top of the outer altar.</b> |
| Exodus 27:21 | from evening to morning, | Menachot 89a:17 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Three and a half</b> <i>log</i> of oil were required <b>for the Candelabrum,</b> as there were seven lamps and <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> was required <b>for each lamp.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Candelabrum: “Aaron and his sons shall arrange it <b>from evening to morning,</b> before the Lord” (Exodus 27:21). This indicates that <b>you shall put into</b> each lamp <b>its</b> required <b>quantity</b> of oil <b>so that it will continue burning from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that the mitzva is fulfilled throughout the night, and <b>you have no</b> other <b>rite that is valid from evening until morning except for this one alone. And the Sages calculated</b> that <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> of oil for each lamp is necessary to ensure that they continue burning <b>from evening until morning.</b> |
| Exodus 27:21 | “Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, | Menachot 98b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the western lamp of the Candelabrum: <b>“Aaron and his sons shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning before the Lord” (Exodus 27:21), indicating that this lamp must be in greater proximity to the Holy of Holies, which is possible only if the Candelabrum is positioned from east to west? The Gemara replies that according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the term “before the Lord” means that the wick of the middle lamp is turned toward the Holy of Holies, as the priest who kindles the lamps <b>turns</b> the wicks of the other lamps slightly <b>to the side,</b> whereas the wick of the middle lamp is turned directly toward the Holy of Holies. |
| Exodus 27:21 | from evening to morning | Pesachim 59a:3 | The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of lamps, <b>as the Merciful One</b> explicitly <b>excludes</b> in the Torah the possibility that the lamps will be kindled first by means of the word <b>it [<i>oto</i>],</b> which emphasizes that the lamps are kindled later. The Gemara clarifies: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse pertaining to the lamps: “In the tent of meeting, outside of the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set it in order <b>from evening to morning</b> before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21). The phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that <b>you shall allocate</b> the candelabrum <b>its measure</b> of oil, so that <b>it will burn from evening until morning.</b> |
| Exodus 27:21 | from evening until morning | Yoma 15a:1 | It means: <b>At the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of the ashes <b>you shall burn the incense,</b> and no later. <b>As, if you do not say so</b> but explain that the phrase: He shall burn the incense, at the end of the verse means after cleaning the lamps, then with regard to the burning of the <b>afternoon</b> incense, with regard to <b>which it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8), in <b>this</b> case <b>too,</b> does it mean that <b>initially</b> the priest <b>lights the lamps and</b> only <b>then burns the afternoon incense? And if you say indeed,</b> that is <b>so, wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Aaron and his sons will set it in order to burn <b>from evening until morning</b> before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21)? |
| Exodus 27:21 | from evening to morning” | Zevachim 11b:30 | The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written:</b> “To burn <b>from evening to morning”</b> (Exodus 27:21). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that you must <b>allocate</b> the Candelabrum <b>its measure</b> of oil so <b>that it will burn from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the same verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>Only this rite is valid from evening until morning,</b> since all other rites must be performed during the day. Therefore, the Candelabrum is lit only at the end of the day. |
| Exodus 28:2 | “For glory [ kavod ] and for majesty [ tiferet ]” | Megillah 12a:7 | The verse states: <b>“When he showed the riches of his glorious [<i>kevod</i>] kingdom</b> and the honor of his majestic [<i>tiferet</i>] greatness” (Esther 1:4). <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: This teaches that</b> Ahasuerus <b>wore the priestly vestments.</b> Proof for this assertion may be adduced from the fact that the same terms are written with regard to the priestly vestments, as <b>it is written here:</b> “The riches of his glorious [<i>kevod</i>] kingdom and <b>the honor of his majestic [<i>tiferet</i>] greatness.” And it is written there,</b> with regard to the priestly garments: <b>“For glory [<i>kavod</i>] and for majesty [<i>tiferet</i>]”</b> (Exodus 28:2). |
| Exodus 28:4 | “And these are the garments which they shall make: A breastplate, and an efod, | Shabbat 31a:7 | There was <b>another incident involving one gentile who was passing behind the study hall</b> and <b>heard the voice of a teacher who was</b> teaching Torah to his students and <b>saying</b> the verse: <b>“And these are the garments which they shall make: A breastplate, and an <i>efod,</i></b> and a robe, and a tunic of checkered work, a mitre, and a girdle” (Exodus 28:4). <b>The gentile said: These</b> garments, <b>for whom are they</b> designated? The students <b>said to him: For the High Priest. The gentile said to himself: I will go and convert so that they will install me as High Priest. He came before Shammai</b> and <b>said to him: Convert me on condition that you install me</b> as High Priest. Shammai <b>pushed him with the builder’s cubit in his hand. He came before Hillel; he converted him.</b> |
| Exodus 28:5 | The verse states: “And they shall take the gold, | Bava Batra8b:9 | <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not appoint an authority over the community</b> composed <b>of fewer than two</b> people. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that this is derived from a verse referring to those engaged in building the Tabernacle and weaving the priestly vestments, who received the community’s donations. <b>The verse states: “And they shall take the gold,</b> and the sky-blue wool, and the purple wool” (Exodus 28:5). The plural “they” indicates that the collection must be performed by two people. |
| Exodus 28:10 | on his shoulders, one on this side and one on that side, and the names of the twelve tribes were written on them, six on this stone and six on that stone, as it is stated: “Six of their names on the one stone, | Sotah 36a:12 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this answer: <b>The High Priest had two precious stones</b> on the part of the ephod that rested <b>on his shoulders, one on this side and one on that side, and the names of the twelve tribes were written on them, six on this stone and six on that stone, as it is stated: “Six of their names on the one stone,</b> and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth” (Exodus 28:10). |
| Exodus 28:10 | “According to their birth” | Sotah 36b:3 | <b>But rather,</b> if their names were not written in the order of their births, then <b>how do I establish</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“According to their birth”</b> (Exodus 28:10)? It means that their names were written <b>according to</b> the <b>names that their father,</b> Jacob, <b>called them, and not according to the names that Moses called them.</b> On the stones it said <b>Reuben, and not Reubenites; Simeon, and not Simeonites; Dan, and not Danites; Gad, and not Gadites.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion, as according to all of the opinions in the <i>baraita</i>, the division of the names on the ephod is not identical to the division of the tribes on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The Gemara confirms: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana is</b> in fact <b>a conclusive refutation.</b> |
| Exodus 28:15 | judgments, as it is written: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment” | Arakhin 16a:15 | The <b>breastplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for</b> improper <b>judgments, as it is written: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment”</b> (Exodus 28:15). The <b>ephod</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for idol worship, as it is written: “And without ephod or teraphim”</b> (Hosea 3:4), that is to say, when there is no ephod, the sin of teraphim, i.e., idol worship, is found. This indicates that if there is an ephod, there is no sin of idol worship. The <b>robe</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for malicious speech,</b> as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He says:</b> Let an <b>item that</b> produces <b>sound,</b> i.e., the bells of the robe, <b>come and atone for</b> an <b>act of</b> malicious <b>sound,</b> i.e., malicious speech. |
| Exodus 28:15 | you shall make it” | Yoma 71b:13 | <b>Rav Mari said</b> another reason not to derive the number of strands in a pomegranate from the breastplate and ephod: “Like the work of the ephod <b>you shall make it”</b> (Exodus 28:15) <b>is written</b> with regard to the breastplate to indicate that <b>you shall make it,</b> i.e., the breastplate, like the ephod, which indicates that <b>for this,</b> i.e., the breastplate, you shall use thread of twenty-eight strands, <b>and not for anything else.</b> |
| Exodus 28:15 | As it is written: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilled craftsman; like the work of the ephod you shall make it: Of gold, sky-blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen” | Yoma 72a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> further states: Each thread of the <b>breastplate and ephod</b> was made of <b>twenty-eight</b> strands. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilled craftsman; like the work of the ephod you shall make it: Of gold, sky-blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen”</b> (Exodus 28:15). There are <b>four</b> colored threads, <b>each</b> composed <b>of six</b> strands, which makes <b>twenty-four.</b> In addition, <b>gold</b> is spun together with each of the <b>four</b> colors, giving the total of <b>twenty-eight.</b> |
| Exodus 28:15 | judgments, as it is stated: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment” | Zevachim 88b:7 | Rabbi Inini bar Sason continues: The <b>belt atones for thought of the heart.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The belt atones for the sins occurring <b>where it is</b> situated, i.e., over the heart. The <b>breastplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for</b> improper <b>judgments, as it is stated: “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment”</b> (Exodus 28:15). The <b>ephod</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for idol worship, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>without ephod or teraphim”</b> (Hosea 3:4), meaning that when there is no ephod, the sin of teraphim, i.e., idol worship, is found. Therefore, it may be inferred that if there is an ephod, there is no sin of idol worship. |
| Exodus 28:20 | “A beryl [ tarshish ], an onyx, and a jasper” | Megillah 12b:10 | <b>“Carshena”; the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, did</b> the gentiles <b>ever offer before You lambs [<i>karim</i>] of the first year [<i>shana</i>], as the Jewish people have offered before You? “Shethar”; have they ever offered before You two turtledoves [<i>shetei torim</i>]? “Admatha”; have they ever built before You an altar of earth [<i>adama</i>]? “Tarshish”; have they ever ministered before You in the priestly vestments, as it is written</b> that on the fourth of the four rows of precious stones contained on the breastplate were: <b>“A beryl [<i>tarshish</i>], an onyx, and a jasper”</b> (Exodus 28:20). <b>“Meres”; have they ever stirred [<i>meirsu</i>] the blood of the offerings before You? “Marsena”; have they ever stirred [<i>meirsu</i>] the meal-offering before You? “Memucan”; have they ever prepared [<i>hekhinu</i>]</b> the <b>table before You,</b> on which the shewbread was placed? |
| Exodus 28:20 | And they may not be scratched on with a scalpel [ izemel ], because it is stated: “In their full settings” | Sotah 48b:12 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who maintains that they used iron tools even in the cutting of the stones for the Temple, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>did the <i>shamir</i> come?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It</b> was <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These stones</b> in the breastplate and ephod, upon which were inscribed the names of the tribes, <b>they may not be written on with ink, because it is stated: “Like the engravings of a signet”</b> (Exodus 28:21), which means the names must be engraved onto the stones. <b>And they may not be scratched on with a scalpel [<i>izemel</i>], because it is stated: “In their full settings”</b> (Exodus 28:20), indicating that the stones must be complete and not missing any of their mass. |
| Exodus 28:21 | they may not be written on with ink, because it is stated: “Like the engravings of a signet” | Sotah 48b:12 | The Gemara poses a question: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who maintains that they used iron tools even in the cutting of the stones for the Temple, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>did the <i>shamir</i> come?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It</b> was <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These stones</b> in the breastplate and ephod, upon which were inscribed the names of the tribes, <b>they may not be written on with ink, because it is stated: “Like the engravings of a signet”</b> (Exodus 28:21), which means the names must be engraved onto the stones. <b>And they may not be scratched on with a scalpel [<i>izemel</i>], because it is stated: “In their full settings”</b> (Exodus 28:20), indicating that the stones must be complete and not missing any of their mass. |
| Exodus 28:28 | as that which is written: “And the breastplate shall not be loosed [ yizaḥ ] from the ephod” | Chullin 7a:3 | The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>the one who says <i>meziḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as that which is written: “And the breastplate shall not be loosed [<i>yizaḥ</i>] from the ephod”</b> (Exodus 28:28). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says: One does not disregard [<i>mazniḥin</i>],</b> it is <b>as it is written: “For the Lord will not abandon [<i>yizaḥ</i>] forever”</b> (Lamentations 3:31). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says <i>mazḥiḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 14:9): <b>From</b> the time <b>that those with conceited [<i>zeḥuḥei</i>] hearts proliferated, dispute proliferated among the Jewish people.</b> |
| Exodus 28:28 | “And the breastplate shall not be loosened | Makkot 22a:8 | <b>Abaye objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate one who loosens the breastplate from upon the ephod</b> in the course of plowing, <b>or one who removes the staves of the Ark</b> of the Covenant. <b>And its prohibition is from here:</b> “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; <b>they shall not be removed</b> from it” (Exodus 25:15), while the relevant verse with regard to the breastplate is: <b>“And the breastplate shall not be loosened</b> from the ephod” (Exodus 28:28). |
| Exodus 28:28 | shall not be detached | Yoma 72a:9 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who detaches the breastplate from upon the ephod</b> or <b>one who removes the staves of the Ark</b> from their rings transgresses a Torah prohibition and <b>is flogged, as it is stated:</b> “And the breastplate <b>shall not be detached</b> from the ephod” (Exodus 28:28),and it is also stated: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; <b>they shall not be removed</b> from it” (Exodus 25:15). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to this:</b> But <b>perhaps when the Merciful One said</b> this in the Torah, the intention was <b>to strengthen them and make them fast so that</b> the breastplate <b>not become detached</b> from the ephod <b>and</b> the staves <b>not be removed.</b> He suggests that the Torah was giving an explanation, not a prohibition. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: In order that it not become detached, and: In order that they not be removed?</b> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition. |
| Exodus 28:30 | and it shall be upon Aaron’s heart, | Arakhin 16a:14 | The <b>mitre atones for the arrogant, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item</b> placed <b>at an elevation,</b> i.e., on the head of a priest, <b>shall come and atone for</b> the <b>matter of an elevated</b> heart. The <b>belt atones for thought of the heart.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The belt atones for the sins occurring <b>where it is</b> situated, i.e., over the heart, <b>as it is written:</b> “And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Tummim; <b>and it shall be upon Aaron’s heart,</b> when he goes in before the Lord; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually” (Exodus 28:30). |
| Exodus 28:31 | entirely of blue [ kelil tekhelet ]” | Menachot 42b:13 | The Gemara notes that the <i>halakha</i> that using the dye for testing renders all the dye in the pot unfit is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <i>Tekhelet</i> dye that was used for <b>testing</b> is <b>unfit, as it is stated</b> concerning the priestly vestments: “And you shall make the robe of the ephod <b>entirely of blue [<i>kelil tekhelet</i>]”</b> (Exodus 28:31), which indicates that the dye must be used exclusively for this purpose, i.e., this must be the first item it is being used to dye. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel.</b> |
| Exodus 28:31 | spun of sky-blue” | Yoma 72a:1 | <b>spun of sky-blue”</b> (Exodus 28:31). <b>And derive</b> a verbal analogy from the term <b>“sky-blue”</b> used here and the same term <b>“sky-blue” from</b> the verse about <b>the curtain: Just as there,</b> with regard to the curtain, there are <b>six</b> strands, <b>so too here,</b> there are <b>six</b> strands. Then, since the Torah also says the threads are spun, i.e., each strand is made of two thinner strands spun together, each thread must contain twelve strands. |
| Exodus 28:32 | it shall not be torn” | Yoma 72a:8 | § The Gemara discusses various <i>halakhot</i> concerning the priestly vestments and other sacred vessels: <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who</b> intentionally <b>tears</b> any of the <b>priestly vestments</b> transgresses a prohibition and <b>is flogged, as it is stated</b> concerning the robe: “It shall have a hem of woven work around the opening of it, like the opening of a coat of mail, and <b>it shall not be torn”</b> (Exodus 28:32). Just as it is prohibited to tear the opening of the robe, so too, it is prohibited to tear any of the priestly vestments. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to this: But perhaps this is what the Merciful One is saying</b> in the Torah: <b>An opening should be made in order that it not tear.</b> In other words, the Torah was giving an explanation, not a prohibition. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: In order that it not be torn?</b> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition. |
| Exodus 28:32 | woven work, as it is stated: “Woven work” | Yoma 72b:3 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection to this</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Priestly vestments</b> should <b>not be made through needle-work but</b> though <b>woven work, as it is stated: “Woven work”</b> (Exodus 28:32). The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said:</b> Reish Lakish’s statement <b>is necessary only for,</b> i.e., refers only to, <b>the sleeves. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A sleeve</b> made for the <b>priestly vestments is woven separately and</b> then <b>attached to the garment</b> by sewing, <b>and</b> the sleeve is made to <b>reach as far as the palm of the hand.</b> However, the main body of the garment must indeed be made exclusively though weaving. |
| Exodus 28:32 | as it is stated: “Woven work” | Zevachim 88a:15 | <b>The Sages taught: Priestly vestments are not fashioned</b> by <b>needlework,</b> i.e., by stitching various parts together, but <b>rather</b> through <b>woven work,</b> whereby the entire garment is initially woven into one entity, <b>as it is stated: “Woven work”</b> (Exodus 28:32). If the garments <b>were soiled one may not launder</b> them, <b>neither with natron nor with soap,</b> two common detergents. |
| Exodus 28:32 | “It shall not be torn” | Zevachim 95a:4 | § Earlier (94b–95a), the Gemara discusses a garment upon which the blood of a sin offering has sprayed; if it has contracted ritual impurity outside of the Temple courtyard, it must be torn before it is brought back into the courtyard to be laundered. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If the <b>robe</b> of the High Priest upon which the blood of a sin offering has sprayed <b>has contracted ritual impurity</b> outside of the Temple courtyard, one does not tear it; rather, <b>he brings it in</b> to the courtyard gradually, in portions <b>less than</b> the measure of a garment susceptible to impurity, which is <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>and</b> he <b>launders it</b> section by section as the robe crosses the threshold. The ritually impure robe must be brought into the courtyard in this manner <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the High Priest’s robe: <b>“It shall not be torn”</b> (Exodus 28:32). |
| Exodus 28:33 | “And you shall make | Yoma 71b:14 | <b>Rav Ashi said</b> another reason that there could not be twenty-eight strands in a pomegranate: <b>“And you shall make</b> pomegranates of sky-blue, and of purple, and of scarlet” (Exodus 28:33) <b>is written</b> to indicate <b>that all the makings of it must be equal,</b> i.e., that each color thread should be made from the same number of strands. However, if there are twenty-eight strands in total, the three threads, each of a different color, cannot be made with an equal number of strands, as <b>how should we do</b> it? <b>Let us make three</b> colored threads <b>of ten</b> strands <b>each;</b> then <b>they are thirty</b> strands in total, which is too many. <b>Let us make two</b> colored threads <b>of nine</b> strands <b>and one of ten;</b> but <b>the verse states: “And you shall make,”</b> to indicate <b>that all the makings of it must be equal.</b> Perforce, the threads used for the pomegranates and the robe must be derived from an item woven from threads of a number of strands divisible by three, such as the curtain. |
| Exodus 28:35 | this day it has a ring | Yoma 44b:16 | It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On every</b> other <b>day it did not have a ring, but</b> on <b>this day it has a ring</b> on the end of the handle, which clatters against it and makes a noise in fulfillment of the verse “And the sound thereof shall be heard when he goes in to the Sanctuary” (Exodus 28:35); this is <b>the statement of the son of the Deputy.</b> |
| Exodus 28:37 | “And you shall put it on a thread of sky blue, | Chullin 138a:6 | <b>But say</b> that the garment in question is the <b>cap of wool</b> that the High Priest wears, which is smaller than the belt. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cap of wool was placed on the High Priest’s head, and</b> the <b>frontplate was placed upon it, to fulfill that which is stated</b> with regard to the frontplate: <b>“And you shall put it on a thread of sky blue,</b> and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be” (Exodus 28:37). The term “thread of sky blue” is referring to the cap of sky-blue wool. |
| Exodus 28:38 | it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead” | Arakhin 16a:16 | Finally, the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for an act of brazenness.</b> From where is this derived? <b>Here,</b> with regard to the frontplate, <b>it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), <b>and there,</b> with regard to brazenness, <b>it is written: “And you had a prostitute’s forehead”</b> (Jeremiah 3:3). The statement of Rabbi Anani bar Sason indicates that the robe worn by the High Priest atones for malicious speech, which means that one is not punished by leprosy, as claimed by Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani. |
| Exodus 28:38 | and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items, | Menachot 25a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items,</b> which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). The Sages expounded: <b>But which sin does he bear? If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated: “It shall not be credited</b> to him” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b> |
| Exodus 28:38 | that they may be accepted before the Lord” | Menachot 25a:5 | <b>Abaye said to him: The verse states</b> with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be always upon his forehead, <b>that they may be accepted before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 28:38), teaching that in the case of <b>a sin</b> whose general prohibition is permitted <b>before the Lord,</b> i.e., in the Temple, <b>yes,</b> the frontplate atones for it. But in the case of the <b>sin</b> of offerings <b>that leave</b> the courtyard, whose general prohibition is not permitted before the Lord, the frontplate does <b>not</b> atone for it. |
| Exodus 28:38 | the sin | Menachot 25a:7 | <b>Abaye said to him: The verse states:</b> “And Aaron shall bear <b>the sin</b> committed with the sacred items” (Exodus 28:38), to say that the frontplate atones for <b>a sin that was</b> committed <b>with</b> the offering <b>and I deferred it.</b> This serves <b>to exclude</b> the spoon bearing the incense of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> where there is no sin that was deferred, <b>since its proper</b> performance <b>is</b> for the High Priest to hold it <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, as he must hold both the coal pan and the spoon of incense. |
| Exodus 28:38 | not accepted, | Menachot 25b:1 | the offering is <b>not accepted,</b> as the verse states with regard to the frontplate: “That it may be accepted for them before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), with the term “for them” teaching that this applies only for Jews, not for gentiles. |
| Exodus 28:38 | the Torah states: “And it should be always upon his forehead” | Menachot 36b:10 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: A person is obligated to touch</b> his <b>phylacteries</b> regularly for <b>the entire time</b> that he is wearing them. This is derived from <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest, as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to the <b>frontplate, which has only one mention</b> of God’s name, <b>the Torah states: “And it should be always upon his forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), which means that the High Priest must always be aware that the frontplate is placed on his head and <b>that he should not be distracted from it,</b> then with regard to <b>phylacteries, which have numerous mentions</b> of God’s name, <b>all the more so</b> one must always be aware of them. |
| Exodus 28:38 | and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the consecrated | Pesachim 16b:7 | The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse written about the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the consecrated</b> objects, which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before God” (Exodus 28:38). |
| Exodus 28:38 | it is no longer on his forehead it does not appease | Pesachim 77a:12 | <b>There is no <i>tanna</i> that you have heard</b> of <b>who said</b> that <b>ritual impurity</b> is entirely <b>permitted in</b> cases involving <b>the public,</b> i.e., that with regard to the public there is no significance to ritual impurity in the Temple, <b>except for Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The frontplate</b> of the High Priest, <b>whether it is on his forehead or whether it is not on his forehead, appeases</b> God and thereby facilitates the acceptance of offerings sacrificed in a state of impurity; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> When <b>it is still on his forehead it appeases</b> God, but when <b>it is no longer on his forehead it does not appease</b> Him, as indicated in the verse: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the sacred things which the children of Israel shall hallow” (Exodus 28:38). |
| Exodus 28:38 | the Torah said: “And it should be always upon his forehead” | Shabbat 12a:4 | <b>The</b> Sage of the <b>school</b> of <b>Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may go out</b> <i>ab initio</i> donning <b>phylacteries on Shabbat eve at nightfall.</b> Although one does not don phylacteries on Shabbat and going out donning them involves an element of carrying, there is no concern lest he forget and remove them on Shabbat. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Because Rabba bar Rav Huna said: A person is obligated to touch his phylacteries at all times</b> that he is donning them. This is derived from an <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> [<b><i>kal vaḥomer</i></b>] from <b>the frontplate [<i>tzitz</i>]</b> of the High Priest. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the frontplate, which has only one mention</b> of God’s name, <b>the Torah said: “And it should be always upon his forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), which means that the High Priest must always be aware that the <i>tzitz</i> is placed on his head and <b>that he should not be distracted from it; phylacteries that have numerous mentions</b> of God’s name, <b>all the more so</b> one should always be aware of them. <b>Therefore, he remembers</b> that the phylacteries are on his head and is not likely to come to carry them on Shabbat. On a related note, the Gemara mentions that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says: A person is required to feel his clothing on Shabbat eve at nightfall</b> to ascertain whether he forgot an object in his pockets that he might come to carry on Shabbat. <b>And Rav Yosef</b> commented and <b>said:</b> That is <b>a significant <i>halakha</i> for Shabbat,</b> and it is fitting to do so in order to refrain from violating a prohibition. |
| Exodus 28:38 | “sin” | Shevuot 9b:6 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states: “And He gave it to you to bear the sin of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), <b>and this verse is written with regard to</b> the <b>goat of</b> the <b>New Moon. And</b> its capacity to atone <b>is derived from the frontplate</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“sin”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to the frontplate. The verse there states: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead and Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings” (Exodus 28:38). The verbal analogy teaches as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: <b>“Sin,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the frontplate: <b>“Sin.” Just as there,</b> in the verse in Exodus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where such meat is placed on the altar, <b>so too here,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where a ritually pure person partakes of it. |
| Exodus 28:38 | that they may be accepted | Yevamot 60b:13 | The Gemara suggests: <b>They should</b> have <b>passed them before the frontplate,</b> as described previously with regard to the daughters of Midian. <b>Rav Kahana, son of Rav Natan, said:</b> The verse states with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead…<b>that they may be accepted</b> before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), which indicates that the frontplate is worn <b>for acceptance but not for calamity.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the frontplate should <b>also</b> not have been used <b>with regard to</b> the women of <b>Midian. Rav Ashi said:</b> The word <b>“they” is written</b> in the verse, indicating that <b>for them,</b> the Jewish people, the frontplate is <b>for acceptance but not for calamity; but for gentiles</b> it can be used <b>even for calamity.</b> |
| Exodus 28:38 | “And Aaron will gain forgiveness for the sin committed in the sacred things | Yoma 7a:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection.</b> It is stated: <b>“And Aaron will gain forgiveness for the sin committed in the sacred things</b> that the children of Israel shall hallow in all their sacred gifts, and it shall be always upon his forehead that they may be accepted favorably before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). <b>And for which sin does</b> the frontplate <b>gain forgiveness? If</b> it is for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat it after the permitted time, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). There is no acceptance of an offering that became <i>piggul</i>. <b>And if it is</b> for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> meat of an offering left after the permitted time for eating it passed, <b>it has already been stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). |
| Exodus 28:38 | shall gain forgiveness | Yoma 7b:4 | The Gemara proceeds to analyze the tannaitic dispute between Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Abaye said:</b> In a case <b>where the frontplate broke, everyone,</b> including Rabbi Shimon, <b>agrees that</b> the frontplate <b>no</b> longer <b>effects acceptance. When they disagree is</b> in a case where the frontplate is not on his forehead but is <b>hanging on a peg. Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the verse: “And it shall be <b>on the forehead</b> of Aaron <b>and</b> Aaron <b>shall gain forgiveness</b> for the sin committed in the sacred things” (Exodus 28:38) means that the frontplate atones for sin as long as it is on his forehead. |
| Exodus 28:38 | and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred | Zevachim 23a:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a verse written about the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred</b> items, which the children of Israel shall consecrate, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before God” (Exodus 28:38). <b>And</b> the Sages expounded: <b>Which sin does</b> Aaron <b>bear?</b> |
| Exodus 28:38 | and derive like this: | Zevachim 23b:6 | The Gemara notes: <b>And some infer</b> the opposite <b>and derive like this:</b> The verse states of the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items” (Exodus 28:38). That is, it <b>does</b> bear <b>the iniquity of the sacred items,</b> but it does <b>not</b> bear <b>the iniquity of those who consecrate</b> or sacrifice them, i.e., the owners of the offering or the priests involved in its sacrifice. And to <b>what impurity</b> is this verse referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>impurity</b> due to <b>a creeping animal, is</b> such impurity <b>permitted in</b> cases involving the <b>public? Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>impurity</b> due to <b>a corpse, and</b> the verse indicates that the frontplate <b>does</b> bear <b>the iniquity of</b> the <b>sacred items</b> but does <b>not</b> bear <b>the iniquity of those who consecrate</b> them? This refutes the opinion of the Elders of the South that owners who are impure due to a corpse may send their offerings. |
| Exodus 28:38 | for them | Zevachim 45b:3 | <b>Rav Pappa said to them: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and it <b>is different there, as the verse states</b> with regard to the High Priest’s frontplate, which atones for ritual impurity contracted by offerings in the Temple without the knowledge of those offering them: “And it shall be always upon his forehead that it may be accepted <b>for them</b> before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), which indicates that it is accepted <b>for them,</b> i.e., for Jews, <b>but not for gentiles.</b> |
| Exodus 28:38 | the verse states: “That it may be accepted for them | Zevachim 45b:5 | <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says</b> that it is not from the words “for them” that one derives that the offering of a gentile is not accepted when the blood that was sprinkled had become impure. Rather, it is because the atonement achieved by way of the High Priest’s frontplate does not apply to gentiles, as <b>the verse states: “That it may be accepted for them</b> before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), <b>and gentiles are not subject to</b> the <b>acceptance</b> of offerings. |
| Exodus 28:38 | ritually impure. | Zevachim 82a:16 | With regard to <b>all the blood disqualified</b> for presentation <b>that was placed on the altar, the frontplate effects acceptance only</b> for offerings sacrificed <b>that</b> are <b>ritually impure.</b> Although it is written with regard to the frontplate worn on the forehead of the High Priest: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity committed in the sacred matters” (Exodus 28:38), this does not apply to all disqualifications of offerings. This is <b>because the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> offerings sacri-ficed <b>that</b> are <b>ritually impure but does not effect acceptance for</b> offerings <b>that leave</b> the courtyard. |
| Exodus 28:38 | with regard to the frontplate it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead” | Zevachim 88b:8 | The <b>robe</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for malicious speech. From where</b> is this known? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item that</b> produces <b>sound,</b> i.e., the robe, which has bells, <b>shall come and atone for an evil sound. And</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for brazenness.</b> This is derived from the fact that <b>with regard to the frontplate it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), <b>and with regard to brazenness it is written: “And you had a harlot’s forehead”</b> (Jeremiah 3:3). |
| Exodus 28:42 | “And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness” | Arakhin 16a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Doesn’t Rabbi Anani bar Sason say: Why</b> was the <b>passage</b> in the Torah that discusses the <b>priestly vestments</b> (Leviticus 8) <b>juxtaposed to</b> the <b>passage</b> that discusses <b>offerings</b> (Leviticus, chapters 1–7)? <b>To tell you</b> that <b>just as offerings atone, so too the priestly vestments atone.</b> For what does each garment atone? The <b>tunic [<i>ketonet</i>] atones for bloodshed, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph’s brothers after they plotted to kill him: <b>“And they killed a goat, and dipped the coat [<i>ketonet</i>] in the blood”</b> (Genesis 37:31). The <b>trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”</b> (Exodus 28:42). |
| Exodus 28:42 | “And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness, | Niddah 13b:22 | <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> One can <b>learn from</b> the statement of the Rabbis that a pouch wrapped around one’s penis can warm it enough to cause a seminal emission, that <b>trousers are prohibited</b> to be worn, as they too warm the penis, by being placed so they are tight against it. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the priestly garments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness,</b> from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach” (Exodus 28:42)? |
| Exodus 28:42 | “And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness” | Zevachim 88b:6 | The <b>tunic atones for bloodshed, as it is stated</b> with regard to the brothers of Joseph after they plotted to kill him: <b>“And they killed a goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood”</b> (Genesis 37:31). The <b>trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, as it is stated</b> with regard to fashioning the priestly vestments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”</b> (Exodus 28:42). The <b>mitre atones for the arrogant. From where</b> is this derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item</b> that is placed <b>at an elevation,</b> i.e., on the head of a priest, <b>shall come and atone for</b> the sin of <b>an elevated</b> heart. |
| Exodus 28:43 | to minister in the sacred place” | Zevachim 119b:18 | The Gemara continues detailing the distinctions between great public altars and small private altars: <b>And a priest</b> is required only at a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall sprinkle</b> the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:6). Priestly <b>service vestments</b> are required only at a public altar, as it is written: “And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons when they go into the Tent of Meeting or when they come near to the altar <b>to minister in the sacred place”</b> (Exodus 28:43). |
| Exodus 28:43 | “statute” | Zevachim 18a:1 | <b>The verse states “statute”</b> with regard to those who drank wine, and it likewise states <b>“statute”</b> with regard to the priestly vestments (Exodus 28:43) and with regard to the washing of the hands and feet (Exodus 30:21). One therefore derives <b>by verbal analogy</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in all three cases is the same. If so, there is already a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one who lacks the requisite priestly vestments disqualifies the service. |
| Exodus 28:43 | “When they go into the Tent of Meeting” | Zevachim 26a:21 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the priest was <b>inside and his fringes,</b> i.e., his hair, were <b>outside,</b> and he collected the blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Did you not say</b> that the verse: <b>“That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), indicates that an offering may not be slaughtered <b>unless all of it comes inside? Here, too,</b> the verse states with regard to the priests: <b>“When they go into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Exodus 28:43), indicating that the priest may not perform rites <b>unless all of him comes into the Tent of Meeting.</b> |
| Exodus 29:1 | service” | Yoma 5b:4 | Apropos the matters mentioned that are not explicit in the portion, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Trousers</b> are one of the priestly vestments worn during the inauguration, but they <b>are not written in the</b> Torah <b>portion. When</b> the verse <b>says: “And this is the matter that you shall do for them to sanctify them for</b> My <b>service”</b> (Exodus 29:1), the superfluous word: And, which appears at the beginning of the verse, comes to add to that which was written previously and <b>to include trousers and the tenth of an ephah</b> offered by a priest on the day that he begins his service. |
| Exodus 29:6 | “And you shall set the mitre upon his head” | Arakhin 3b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about the phylacteries <b>of the arm?</b> You claim that priests are exempt from this obligation, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“He shall put upon his flesh.”</b> If so, they should <b>also</b> be exempt from donning the phylacteries of the <b>head,</b> as <b>it is written</b> with regard to the High Priest: <b>“And you shall set the mitre upon his head”</b> (Exodus 29:6). Since the phylacteries of the head would interpose between his head and the mitre, he should be exempt from the mitzva of the phylacteries of the head. |
| Exodus 29:6 | written with regard to the head: “And you shall set the mitre upon his head” | Zevachim 19a:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the phylacteries <b>of the hand</b> that only they interpose? The verse indicates the difference, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the vestments covering the body: <b>“Shall he put upon his body”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating <b>that nothing may interpose between</b> the vestment <b>and his body.</b> The Gemara challenges: But there is <b>also</b> a verse <b>written with regard to the head: “And you shall set the mitre upon his head”</b> (Exodus 29:6), indicating that there must be no interposition between the mitre and the head. If so, the phylacteries of the head should be considered an interposition as well. |
| Exodus 29:9 | “You shall gird them with a belt, | Sanhedrin 83b:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the punishment for a priest <b>who is lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments</b> and who performed the Temple service is death at the hand of Heaven. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is his punishment? <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> there are those who <b>determined</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is a tradition that was cited <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon:</b> It is stated: <b>“You shall gird them with a belt,</b> Aaron and his sons, and you shall wrap the headdresses upon them; and they shall have the priesthood as an eternal statute, and you shall inaugurate Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9). |
| Exodus 29:9 | written: “And gird them | Yoma 5b:9 | <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to the <b>tunic and mitre everyone agrees that</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons, as both in</b> the portion of <b>the command</b> concerning the inauguration <b>and in</b> the portion of <b>the implementation,</b> mention of <b>Aaron precedes</b> mention of his sons. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to the belt.</b> The Gemara elaborates. The <b>one who said:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and afterward his sons</b> derives it from that <b>which is written: “And he girded him with the belt”</b> (Leviticus 8:7), <b>and then it is written: “And he girded them with belts”</b> (Leviticus 8:13). Moses first dressed Aaron in all of the garments, including the belt, and then Moses dressed Aaron’s sons. <b>And</b> the <b>one who said:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and his sons, simultaneously</b> derives it from that <b>which is</b> subsequently <b>written: “And gird them</b> with belts, Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9), indicating that Moses girded them all with belts simultaneously. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to the one who says:</b> Moses dressed <b>Aaron and his sons simultaneously, isn’t it written: He girded him with the belt, and then it is written: He girded them with belts,</b> clearly indicating that he dressed Aaron and then his sons? |
| Exodus 29:9 | in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: As the verse states: “And you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind mitres on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute” | Zevachim 17b:6 | § The mishna teaches that a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments</b> disqualifies the rites he performs. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Avuh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> some <b>determined it</b> to be stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: As the verse states: “And you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind mitres on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute”</b> (Exodus 29:9). The verse indicates that <b>when their vestments are on them, their priesthood is upon them,</b> but if <b>their vestments are not on them, their priesthood is not upon them</b> and their rites are disqualified. |
| Exodus 29:9 | not | Zevachim 18a:2 | The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> one derived the <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there, I would say: This matter,</b> i.e., that the rites of one who lacks the requisite vestments are disqualified, applies only to <b>a rite for which a non-priest is liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, since that is the topic of the passage discussing those who drank wine. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a rite for which a non-priest is not liable</b> to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>I will say</b> that they are <b>not</b> subject to this <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, the verse (Exodus 29:9) <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> applies to all rites. |
| Exodus 29:9 | derived from here, | Zevachim 18a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>Still,</b> is the disqualification of rites performed by one lacking the requisite vestments <b>derived from here,</b> i.e., from the verse: “And you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9)? <b>It is derived from there: “And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put</b> fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:7). The superfluous term “the priest” serves to indicate that he may serve only <b>in his priestly state.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches</b> that <b>with regard to a High Priest who wore the vestments of an ordinary priest and performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites, his service is disqualified.</b> |
| Exodus 29:12 | with regard to placing? As it is written: “And you shall take of the blood of the bullock and put it upon the corners of the altar with your finger” | Zevachim 24b:3 | <b>And where is</b> the word <b>“finger” stated</b> only <b>with regard to placing? As it is written: “And you shall take of the blood of the bullock and put it upon the corners of the altar with your finger”</b> (Exodus 29:12). <b>And he holds</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted</b> based on juxtaposition to the language immediately <b>preceding it and not</b> to the language <b>before that</b> which immediately <b>precedes it, nor</b> to the language <b>following it.</b> |
| Exodus 29:25 | “an aroma pleasing | Menachot 21a:6 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda himself says:</b> With regard to the <b>limbs</b> of a burnt offering <b>that</b> one first <b>roasted and</b> afterward <b>brought them up</b> to the altar, <b>they do not constitute</b> fulfillment of the requirement of the verse that an offering be <b>“an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Exodus 29:25). |
| Exodus 29:27 | “Which is waved, and which is heaved up” | Menachot 61a:7 | <b>How does one perform</b> this waving? <b>He places the two loaves on top</b> of the <b>two lambs and places his two hands below</b> the loaves and the lambs, <b>extends</b> the offerings to each of the four directions <b>and brings</b> them <b>back,</b> then <b>raises and lowers</b> them, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the waving of the ram of the inauguration of the priests: <b>“Which is waved, and which is heaved up”</b> (Exodus 29:27); i.e., waved back and forth, and heaved up and down. <b>Waving was</b> able to be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, <b>but</b> the <b>bringing near</b> of meal offerings had to be done <b>to the west,</b> i.e., the southwest corner of the altar. Also, with regard to all meal offerings, <b>the wavings precede the</b> actions of <b>bringing near.</b> |
| Exodus 29:27 | as it is stated: “Which is waved and which is lifted” | Sukkah 37b:9 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 61a): With regard to <b>the two loaves and the two lambs</b> offered on the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>, how does he perform</b> their waving before the altar? <b>He places the two loaves atop the two lambs, and places his hand beneath them, and waves to and fro</b> to each side, <b>and he raises and lowers</b> them, <b>as it is stated: “Which is waved and which is lifted”</b> (Exodus 29:27), indicating that there is waving to the sides as well as raising and lowering. |
| Exodus 29:28 | “And it shall be for Aaron and his sons” | Avodah Zarah10b:14 | The emperor <b>said to</b> Ketia: <b>You have spoken well</b> and your statement is correct; <b>but they throw anyone who defeats the king</b> in argument <b>into a house full of ashes [<i>lekamonya ḥalila</i>],</b> where he would die. <b>When they were seizing</b> Ketia <b>and going</b> to take him to his death, <b>a certain matron [<i>matronita</i>] said to him: Woe to the ship that goes without</b> paying the <b>tax.</b> Ketia <b>bent down over his foreskin, severed it,</b> and <b>said: I gave my tax; I</b> will <b>pass and enter. When they threw him</b> into the house of ashes, <b>he said: All of my property</b> is given <b>to Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues.</b> How was this inheritance to be divided? The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Akiva went out and taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Exodus 29:28), means <b>half to Aaron and half to his sons.</b> Here too, as Rabbi Akiva is mentioned separately, he should receive half, while his colleagues receive the other half. |
| Exodus 29:29 | the verse states: “And the sacred garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them” | Yoma 5a:12 | <b>If you wish, say:</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the verse:</b> “And the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement,” <b>is necessary to exclude</b> requirements derived from other sources, i.e., that both donning multiple garments and anointment must be for seven days. Apparently, anointment for seven days is required <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the sacred garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them”</b> (Exodus 29:29). <b>Anointment is juxtaposed</b> in this verse <b>to</b> donning <b>multiple</b> garments: <b>Just as</b> donning <b>multiple</b> garments is required <b>for seven</b> days <i>ab initio</i>, <b>so too, anointment</b> is required <b>for seven</b> days <i>ab initio</i>. |
| Exodus 29:29 | As it is stated: “And the sacred garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him” | Yoma 72b:20 | § It was taught in the mishna: When dressed <b>in these</b> eight garments, the High Priest may <b>be consulted for</b> the decision of the <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said:</b> The <b>garments in which the High Priest serves</b> are also worn when the <b>priest anointed for war serves.</b> This priest is appointed to recite words of encouragement to the nation before it goes out to war (see Deuteronomy 20:2). <b>As it is stated: “And the sacred garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him”</b> (Exodus 29:29), which is taken to refer <b>to the one who comes after him in greatness,</b> meaning the priest whose rank is one lower than the High Priest, i.e., the priest anointed for war. |
| Exodus 29:30 | Since it is stated: “Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead don them” | Yoma 5a:10 | <b>Since it is stated: “Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead don them”</b> (Exodus 29:30), <b>I</b> derive <b>only</b> that one who donned the <b>multiple</b> garments of the High Priest for <b>seven</b> days <b>and was anointed seven</b> days assumes the position of High Priest and may perform the service on Yom Kippur. However, with regard to whether one who donned the <b>multiple</b> garments for <b>seven</b> days <b>and was anointed</b> for <b>one</b> day, or one who donned the <b>multiple</b> garments for <b>one</b> day <b>and was anointed</b> for <b>seven</b> days is thereby inaugurated as High Priest, <b>from where</b> are those cases derived? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated”; in any case</b> he is appointed High Priest, even if either anointment or donning the garments did not continue for seven days. |
| Exodus 29:30 | the verse states: “Seven days shall he wear them, the one who serves in his stead from among his sons, who comes into the Tent of Meeting | Yoma 73a:1 | therefore, <b>the verse states: “Seven days shall he wear them, the one who serves in his stead from among his sons, who comes into the Tent of Meeting</b> to serve in the Sanctuary” (Exodus 29:30). The verse describes a son serving in the place of his father, indicating that the position is inherited. The conclusion of the verse implies that the rule that a son inherits his father’s position applies only to a High Priest <b>who is fit to enter the Tent of Meeting,</b> but not to the priest anointed for war. Based on this <i>baraita</i>, the following challenge is posed: <b>And if it is so,</b> since the priest anointed for war also serves wearing the same garments as the High Priest, <b>he is</b> also <b>fit</b> to enter the Tent of Meeting and should bequeath his position to his son. |
| Exodus 29:32 | opening | Yoma 5b:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One <b>derives a</b> verbal analogy between the word opening that appears in the two portions of the inauguration. It is written in the command concerning the inauguration: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 29:32), and in its fulfillment it is written: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 8:31). Failure to perform the matters written in both portions invalidates the inauguration.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> The verbal analogy is unnecessary, as the conclusion can be derived directly from the verse written with regard to the implementation of the inauguration: <b>“And keep the charge of the Lord,</b> that you not die, for so I am commanded” (Leviticus 8:35). The emphasis on this being the charge of the Lord comes to teach that failure to perform all the details mentioned in the implementation of the command <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration. <br><b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The phrase: <b>For so I am commanded,</b> is the source from which it is derived that all the details written in both portions <b>invalidate</b> the inauguration. |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made” | Arakhin 4a:3 | The Gemara cites yet another similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> and recite Grace after Meals, including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the priests <b>partake of sacrificial</b> meat. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33), indicating that the owners of those offerings thereby achieve atonement, <b>and</b> therefore <b>this</b> consumption <b>is</b> an obligatory ritual act to bring about <b>atonement,</b> consequently, it is not considered a social meal requiring one to form a <i>zimmun</i>. |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And a non-priest may not eat, as they are sacred” | Makkot 18a:3 | § With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a non-priest who ate</b> the flesh <b>of a burnt-offering before sprinkling</b> its blood, <b>outside the walls, according to Rabbi Shimon</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>five</b> sets of lashes. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him also be flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: <b>“And a non-priest may not eat, as they are sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:33). The Gemara explains: <b>This matter</b> prohibiting a non-priest from eating consecrated food applies only in a case <b>where</b> the food <b>is fit</b> for consumption <b>by priests. Here, where</b> the food <b>is not fit</b> for consumption <b>by priests either,</b> as it is not permitted for anyone to partake of a burnt-offering, there is no specific prohibition that applies to a non-priest. |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned” | Makkot 18b:3 | § <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> a statement about a priest [<i>kohen</i>] and another statement about a non-priest [<i>zar</i>]. Before proceeding, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for these statements: <b><i>Kaf</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>alef</i>.</b> Rav says: <b>A priest who ate of a sin-offering or a guilt-offering before sprinkling</b> their blood on the altar <b>is flogged. What is the reason</b> that he is flogged? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the inauguration offerings, whose halakhic status was like that of sin-offerings and guilt-offerings in that it was permitted only for priests to partake of their flesh: <b>“And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned”</b> (Exodus 29:33), from which it is inferred: <b>After atonement, yes,</b> they may eat the flesh of the offerings; <b>before atonement, no,</b> they may not eat it. And in Rav’s opinion, the status of <b>a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva is</b> that of <b>a prohibition,</b> for which one is flogged. |
| Exodus 29:33 | as the verse states: “And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned… | Makkot 18b:5 | <b>Rather, if it was stated, this was stated: Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: A non-priest who ate of a sin-offering or a guilt-offering before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of their blood is <b>exempt</b> from receiving lashes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states: “And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned…</b>and a non-priest may not eat, as they are sacred” (Exodus 29:33), and it is expounded as follows: <b>Anywhere that we read concerning it: “And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned,” we read concerning it: “And a non-priest may not eat sacrificial food.” But anywhere that we do not read concerning it: “And they shall eat them, that with which they were atoned,”</b> e.g., in this case, where it is prohibited for priests to partake of the flesh of the offerings before the sprinkling of their blood, <b>we do not read concerning it: “And a non-priest may not eat.”</b> |
| Exodus 29:33 | the Merciful One states: “And they shall eat those wherewith atonement was made” | Menachot 73a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues expounding the verse: <b>“And every meal offering of theirs,”</b> serving <b>to include the <i>omer</i> meal offering, and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i>, teaching that they are also eaten by the priests. As, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states: “And they shall eat those wherewith atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33), the verse thereby indicates that the priests may eat only those offerings that help the owner achieve atonement. <b>And this</b> <i>omer</i> <b>comes to permit</b> eating from the new grain (see Leviticus 23:9–14), not to achieve atonement; <b>and</b> concerning <b>the other</b> offering, i.e., the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>, <b>as well,</b> it <b>comes to clarify</b> whether or not the accused woman is guilty of adultery, but not to achieve atonement. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us:</b> “Every meal offering,” to teach that these two meal offerings are included. |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made | Pesachim 59b:4 | <b>And,</b> in addition, <b>as long as the priests have not eaten the meat</b> of the offering, <b>the owners</b> of the offering <b>have not achieved</b> complete <b>atonement, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made</b> to consecrate them, to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat of them for they are sacred” (Exodus 29:33), <b>teaches that the priests eat, and</b> consequently <b>the owners</b> of the offerings <b>achieve atonement.</b> If so, how can one who lacks atonement achieve atonement that day when the priests may not eat the meat of his sin-offering until the sacrificial parts are burned the next day? |
| Exodus 29:33 | eat it? But isn’t it written: “And they shall eat those things through which atonement is attained” | Yevamot 40a:3 | The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if <b>he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it? But isn’t it written: “And they shall eat those things through which atonement is attained”</b> (Exodus 29:33), which <b>teaches that the priests eat</b> portions of the offering <b>and</b> by their doing so <b>the owners</b> who brought the offering <b>attain atonement?</b> Clearly, then, the eating of the offerings is not volitional. |
| Exodus 29:33 | is uprooted, and it is written: “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made” | Yevamot 90a:10 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Ultimately,</b> the Torah mitzva of <b>eating</b> the <b>meat</b> of this offering <b>is uprooted, and it is written: “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33). This verse <b>teaches that the priests eat</b> the offering <b>and</b> the <b>owner</b> thereby <b>gains atonement. He said to him:</b> The case of <b>sit and refrain from action [<i>shev ve’al ta’aseh</i>] is different.</b> In other words, the Sages can uproot a Torah mitzva by instructing one to sit and <b>refrain from action,</b> i.e., to remain passive and do nothing. They cannot, however, uproot a mitzva by telling him to perform an action. |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made” | Yoma 68b:19 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma based on a mishna: The priests <b>would not sleep in</b> the <b>sacred vestments</b> out of concern they might pass wind while sleeping. One may infer: <b>It is</b> specifically <b>sleep which is not</b> permitted, <b>but they may eat</b> while wearing the priestly vestments, even though eating is not a service. This should prove that it is permitted to derive personal benefit from wearing priestly vestments. The Gemara rejects this proof: A proof may not be adduced from here because <b>perhaps eating is different,</b> since <b>it is for the purpose of</b> the Temple <b>service. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33), which <b>teaches that the priests eat</b> the meat of the offerings <b>and the owners</b> of those offerings thereby <b>achieve atonement.</b> |
| Exodus 29:33 | “And they shall eat those items with which atonement is achieved” | Zevachim 44b:6 | The phrase: <b>“Every meal offering of theirs,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b><i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and the meal offering of jealousy,</b> brought by a <i>sota</i>. The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the verse states with regard to the consumption of sacrificial food by the priests: <b>“And they shall eat those items with which atonement is achieved”</b> (Exodus 29:33), only those foods that facilitate atonement are given to the priests. <b>And</b> this would exclude the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of jealousy, as <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering comes to permit</b> the consumption of the new crop, <b>and the meal offering of jealousy comes to clarify</b> the <b>transgression</b> of the <i>sota</i>, as part of the ordeal undergone by the woman. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by the phrase: “Every meal offering of theirs,” that even these meal offerings are eaten by the priests. |
| Exodus 29:33 | they come to qualify | Zevachim 44b:8 | The phrase: <b>“Every guilt offering of theirs,”</b> serves <b>to include the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who contracted ritual impurity, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that these should not be given to the priests to eat, as <b>they come to qualify</b> these individuals, rather than to atone. The guilt offering of a nazirite renders him fit to restart his term of naziriteship, and the guilt offering of a leper qualifies him to eat sacrificial food, whereas the verse states: “And they shall eat those items with which atonement is achieved” (Exodus 29:33). Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by the phrase: “Every guilt offering of theirs,” that these offerings as well are eaten by the priests. |
| Exodus 29:34 | sacred” | Keritot 5a:13 | <b>What is</b> this verbal analogy? One <b>derives</b> by verbal analogy of the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Leviticus and the word <b>“sacred”</b> in Exodus that the verse: “But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity,” is discussing <i>notar</i>. This verse states: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred thing of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is written: “You shall burn the leftovers [<i>notar</i>] in fire;</b> they are not to be eaten, <b>for</b> they are <b>sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34). Just as the verse in Exodus is referring to <i>notar</i>, the same is true of the verse in Leviticus. |
| Exodus 29:34 | “It shall not be eaten because it is sacred” | Makkot 18a:5 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him also be flogged in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. As Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that when it is stated with regard to leftover flesh and loaves from the inauguration offerings: <b>“It shall not be eaten because it is sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34), |
| Exodus 29:34 | “You shall burn the leftovers in fire; they are not to be eaten, because it is sanctified” | Meilah 11b:13 | Before addressing the issue of whether or not the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Tzadok, the Gemara first analyzes the derivation stated at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where is</b> this <i>halakha</i> of burning <b>inferred?</b> After all, the verse it cites is referring to pouring, not burning. <b>Ravina said: It is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between an expression of <b>sanctity</b> written with regard to libations and <b>sanctity</b> written with regard to leftover offerings. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to libations: <b>“In sanctity</b> shall you pour a libation” (Numbers 28:7), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to leftover offerings: <b>“You shall burn the leftovers in fire; they are not to be eaten, because it is sanctified”</b> (Exodus 29:34). |
| Exodus 29:34 | “It shall not be eaten because it is sacred” | Meilah 17b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that <i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> do not join together <b>only with regard to</b> the ritual <b>impurity of the hands</b> if one touched them, which <b>is by rabbinic law. But with regard to</b> the <b>matter of eating, they do join together. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The verse states with regard to leftover sacrificial food from meat and bread: <b>“It shall not be eaten because it is sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34). This teaches with regard to <b>anything sacred</b> that has been <b>disqualified</b> for whatever reason, that <b>the verse comes to apply a prohibition with regard to its consumption.</b> |
| Exodus 29:34 | by incineration, | Menachot 83a:6 | <b>“Inauguration offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>inauguration offering,</b> the rams and the bread of which were brought during the seven days of inauguration of the Tabernacle and which the priests ate, <b>their leftovers</b> were disposed of <b>by incineration,</b> as is stated: “And if any of the flesh of the inauguration offering, or of the bread, remain until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire” (Exodus 29:34), <b>and</b> there were <b>no living animals</b> counted <b>among their leftovers</b> disposed of <b>by incineration, so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned, <b>their leftovers are</b> disposed of <b>by incineration, and there are no living animals</b> counted <b>among their leftovers</b> disposed of <b>by incineration.</b> Accordingly, if one sanctifies two animals so that either one may be brought if the other is lost, when one animal is sacrificed, the surviving animal is not killed and incinerated. |
| Exodus 29:34 | or of the bread, remains until the morning, | Pesachim 24a:4 | The Sage who taught this <i>halakha</i> to Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him: Rabbi Yonatan, your teacher, said that</b> same <i>halakha</i> <b>from this verse: “And if the flesh of the consecration</b> offering, <b>or of the bread, remains until the morning,</b> then you shall burn the leftover with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is sacred” (Exodus 29:34). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “It shall not be eaten,” what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “It shall not be eaten”? If it does not refer to the</b> subject <b>matter itself, as it is</b> already <b>written</b> explicitly: <b>“Then you shall burn the leftover with fire,”</b> which indicates that one may not eat it, <b>refer it to the matter of the other prohibitions in the Torah. And if it does not refer to the matter of</b> the prohibition against <b>eating,</b> as eating these items is explicitly prohibited, <b>refer it to the matter of the prohibition of</b> deriving <b>benefit.</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for one to derive benefit from any item that it is prohibited for him to eat. |
| Exodus 29:34 | “You shall burn the leftovers in fire; they are not to be eaten, for they are sanctity” | Sukkah 49b:1 | <b>just as its pouring is in sanctity, so too must its burning be in sanctity. From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that this is referring to burning? <b>Ravina said: It is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>sanctity</b> written with regard to libations and <b>sanctity</b> written with regard to leftover offerings. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to libations: <b>“In sanctity shall you pour a libation”</b> (Numbers 28:7), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to leftover offerings: <b>“You shall burn the leftovers in fire; they are not to be eaten, for they are sanctity”</b> (Exodus 29:34). Through the verbal analogy it is derived that leftover libations must also be burned. |
| Exodus 29:34 | then you shall burn the remainder [ notar ] with fire; | Zevachim 28b:5 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Zavdi bar Levi taught: It is derived</b> that the prohibition of <i>notar</i> carries the penalty of <i>karet</i> by way of verbal analogy between <b>“sacred”</b> and <b>“sacred.” It is written here:</b> “But whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity, because <b>he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord; and</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 19:8). <b>And it is written there:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain until the morning, <b>then you shall burn the remainder [<i>notar</i>] with fire;</b> it shall not be eaten, because it is sacred” (Exodus 29:34). <b>Just as</b> the verse <b>there</b> is referring to <b><i>notar</i>, so too,</b> there verse <b>here</b> is referring to <b><i>notar</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 29:34 | by incineration, | Zevachim 98a:4 | <b>“Inauguration offering”</b> teaches: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>inauguration offering,</b> the rams and the bread of that offering, which were brought during the seven days of inauguration of the Tabernacle and which the priests ate, <b>their leftovers</b> were disposed of <b>by incineration,</b> as is stated: “And if any of the flesh of the inauguration offering, or of the bread, remain until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire” (Exodus 29:34), <b>and no living animals</b> were <b>among their leftovers</b> designated for incineration; <b>so too</b> for <b>all</b> offerings mentioned, <b>their leftovers are</b> disposed of <b>by incineration, and there are no living animals</b> counted <b>among their leftovers</b> to be incinerated. Accordingly, if one sanctifies two animals so that either one may be brought if the other is lost, when one animal is sacrificed, the surviving animal is not killed and incinerated. |
| Exodus 29:35 | the verse states: “And so shall you do to Aaron and to his sons | Yoma 5a:13 | § After ascertaining the halakhic distinctions between the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina with regard to the inauguration, the Gemara proceeds to analyze the rationales for those opinions. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said:</b> Failure to perform <b>all</b> the details <b>that are written in its</b> regard <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And so shall you do to Aaron and to his sons</b> according to all that I have commanded you, seven days shall you consecrate them” (Exodus 29:35). The term: <b>So,</b> teaches that failure to perform the ritual precisely in this manner <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration. The Gemara asks: That works out <b>well</b> as a source that <b>all</b> |
| Exodus 29:37 | “Whatsoever touches the altar shall be sanctified” | Sanhedrin 34b:1 | <b>“Whatsoever touches the altar shall be sanctified”</b> (Exodus 29:37), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to every item, <b>whether</b> it is <b>suited</b> to be an offering, <b>or unsuited</b> to be an offering. <b>The</b> following <b>verse states:</b> “Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar: Two <b>lambs</b> of the first year day by day continually” (Exodus 29:38); from this I derive: <b>Just as lambs are suited</b> to be offerings, <b>so too, everything</b> that is <b>suited</b> to be an offering is included in this <i>halakha</i>. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The offerings discussed in this passage are each referred to as <b>a burnt-offering</b> (see Exodus 29:42). Therefore, I derive: <b>Just as a burnt-offering is suited</b> for the altar, <b>so too, everything</b> that is <b>suited</b> for the altar is included in this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Exodus 29:37 | is stated: “Whatever touches the altar shall be sacred” | Zevachim 83b:12 | § The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> relating to the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: From that</b> which <b>is stated: “Whatever touches the altar shall be sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:37), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the altar sanctifies any item that ascends upon it, <b>whether</b> it <b>is fit</b> for the altar <b>or whether</b> it <b>is unfit.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar: Two <b>lambs”</b> (Exodus 29:38), to teach: <b>Just as lambs</b> are <b>fit</b> for the altar and are sanctified by it, <b>so too, all</b> items <b>fit</b> for the altar are sanctified by it. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the verse states: <b>“Burnt offering,”</b> to teach: <b>Just as a burnt offering</b> is <b>fit</b> for the altar and is sanctified by it, <b>so too, all</b> items <b>fit</b> for the altar are sanctified by it. |
| Exodus 29:37 | “altar” is written another | Zevachim 83b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabban Gamliel, from where does he derive that the altar sanctifies the items that ascend upon it? The Gemara responds: It is from the fact that the term <b>“altar” is written another</b> time, in the verse: “Whatever touches the altar shall be sacred” (Exodus 29:37). The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua, why does he require two verses to teach the same <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that the altar sanctifies items that ascend upon it? The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> verse is necessary <b>for</b> a case <b>where</b> an item <b>had a time of fitness</b> for consumption by the fire and was then disqualified, e.g., it became ritually impure; <b>and one</b> verse is necessary <b>for</b> a case <b>where</b> an item <b>did not have a time of fitness,</b> e.g., an offering that became disqualified at the moment of its slaughter. |
| Exodus 29:37 | touches the altar | Zevachim 87a:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Just as the altar sanctifies</b> items, so too, the ramp and the service vessels sanctify items. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Whatever <b>touches the altar</b> shall be sacred” (Exodus 29:37). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>altar</b> sanctifies items. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>ramp</b> sanctifies items as well? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall anoint…<b>the altar [<i>et hamizbe’aḥ</i>]”</b> (Exodus 40:10), and the addition of the word <i>et</i> serves to include the ramp. With regard to <b>service vessels, from where</b> is it derived that they sanctify items? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to them: <b>“Whatever touches them shall be sacred”</b> (Exodus 30:29). |
| Exodus 29:38 | the halakhot of slaughtering, as it is stated: “Now this is that which you shall sacrifice upon the altar” | Menachot 29a:15 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Three matters were difficult for Moses</b> to comprehend precisely, <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed</b> them to <b>him with His finger, and these are</b> the three matters: The form of the <b>Candelabrum, and</b> the exact size of the <b>new moon, and</b> the impure <b>creeping animals.</b> The <b>Candelabrum</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And this is the work of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:4). The <b>new moon</b> was shown to him, <b>as it is written: “This month shall be for you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). The <b>creeping animals</b> were shown to him, <b>as it is written: “And these are they which are unclean for you</b> among the swarming things” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that God <b>also</b> showed Moses <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering, as it is stated: “Now this is that which you shall sacrifice upon the altar”</b> (Exodus 29:38), and slaughtering is the first ritual of sacrifice. |
| Exodus 29:38 | lambs | Sanhedrin 34b:1 | <b>“Whatsoever touches the altar shall be sanctified”</b> (Exodus 29:37), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to every item, <b>whether</b> it is <b>suited</b> to be an offering, <b>or unsuited</b> to be an offering. <b>The</b> following <b>verse states:</b> “Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar: Two <b>lambs</b> of the first year day by day continually” (Exodus 29:38); from this I derive: <b>Just as lambs are suited</b> to be offerings, <b>so too, everything</b> that is <b>suited</b> to be an offering is included in this <i>halakha</i>. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The offerings discussed in this passage are each referred to as <b>a burnt-offering</b> (see Exodus 29:42). Therefore, I derive: <b>Just as a burnt-offering is suited</b> for the altar, <b>so too, everything</b> that is <b>suited</b> for the altar is included in this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Exodus 29:38 | lambs | Yoma 62b:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>If so,</b> this line of reasoning should be applied to the <b>daily offerings as well. Let us say</b> that when the verse states: “Two <b>lambs</b> of the first year, day by day, continually” (Exodus 29:38), the <b>minimum</b> number indicated by the word <b>lambs is two. What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “two”?</b> It indicates <b>that the two</b> lambs <b>should be identical. And from where</b> do we derive <b>that even if the two are not identical they are valid? The verse states</b> the word <b>lamb, lamb</b> (Exodus 29:39), repetitively, to <b>amplify.</b> Let us learn from here that in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the preferred manner, <b>we also require</b> that the two lambs used for the daily offering be identical. |
| Exodus 29:38 | day by day” | Yoma 62b:12 | The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Two</b> lambs of the first year, <b>day by day”</b> (Exodus 29:38), indicates that the lambs must be slaughtered <b>opposite the</b> location of the sun at that time of <b>day.</b> |
| Exodus 29:38 | lambs” | Zevachim 83b:12 | § The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> relating to the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: From that</b> which <b>is stated: “Whatever touches the altar shall be sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:37), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the altar sanctifies any item that ascends upon it, <b>whether</b> it <b>is fit</b> for the altar <b>or whether</b> it <b>is unfit.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar: Two <b>lambs”</b> (Exodus 29:38), to teach: <b>Just as lambs</b> are <b>fit</b> for the altar and are sanctified by it, <b>so too, all</b> items <b>fit</b> for the altar are sanctified by it. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the verse states: <b>“Burnt offering,”</b> to teach: <b>Just as a burnt offering</b> is <b>fit</b> for the altar and is sanctified by it, <b>so too, all</b> items <b>fit</b> for the altar are sanctified by it. |
| Exodus 29:39 | and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon” | Menachot 50a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that if the lamb of the daily offering of the morning was not sacrificed and the service of a new altar had not yet been initiated, then the lamb of the afternoon is also not sacrificed? The Gemara explains that it is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; <b>and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 29:39). This verse teaches that <b>the second</b> lamb of the daily offering is sacrificed <b>in the afternoon, but</b> if it is <b>the first</b> one to be sacrificed, it may <b>not</b> be sacrificed <b>in the afternoon.</b> |
| Exodus 29:39 | precede the matter with regard to which only one: In the morning, is stated, | Yoma 33b:12 | Abaye continued: <b>And</b> the burning of the <b>incense</b> on the inner altar <b>precedes</b> the burning of the <b>limbs</b> of the daily offering on the outer altar, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Let the matter with regard to which it is stated: In the morning, in the morning,</b> i.e., the burning of the incense, <b>precede the matter with regard to which only one: In the morning, is stated,</b> i.e., the daily morning offering, in the verse: “You shall offer one lamb in the morning” (Exodus 29:39). |
| Exodus 29:39 | lamb, lamb | Yoma 62b:11 | The Gemara suggests: <b>If so,</b> this line of reasoning should be applied to the <b>daily offerings as well. Let us say</b> that when the verse states: “Two <b>lambs</b> of the first year, day by day, continually” (Exodus 29:38), the <b>minimum</b> number indicated by the word <b>lambs is two. What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “two”?</b> It indicates <b>that the two</b> lambs <b>should be identical. And from where</b> do we derive <b>that even if the two are not identical they are valid? The verse states</b> the word <b>lamb, lamb</b> (Exodus 29:39), repetitively, to <b>amplify.</b> Let us learn from here that in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the preferred manner, <b>we also require</b> that the two lambs used for the daily offering be identical. |
| Exodus 29:40 | oil” | Menachot 51a:4 | Therefore <b>I</b> must <b>deduce</b> as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated there, with regard to the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings: “A tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a <i>hin</i> of beaten <b>oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the libations, the amount of oil required is <b>three <i>log</i> per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour; <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, one brings <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour. |
| Exodus 29:40 | pounded oil” | Menachot 86b:3 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>refined, pounded</b> oil <b>is unfit for meal offerings,</b> since the verse specifies that this oil is to be used for illumination. To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the daily offering: <b>“And a tenth of fine flour, thoroughly mixed with</b> a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of <b>pounded oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). This indicates that pounded oil is fit to be used in meal offerings. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that the refined pounded oil is <b>“for illumination”? Rather,</b> the Torah requires the use of refined pounded oil only for the Candelabrum, <b>due to the sparing [<i>haḥisakhon</i>]</b> of money, as the highest-quality oil is very expensive. |
| Exodus 29:43 | As it is written: “And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be sanctified by My glory” | Zevachim 115b:12 | <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the command for the priests to sanctify themselves is referring to <b>the separation of</b> the <b>firstborn, where is the allusion</b> to the fact that God would be sanctified through Nadav and Avihu? The Gemara replies: <b>As it is written: “And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be sanctified by My glory”</b> (Exodus 29:43). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“by My glory [<i>bikhvodi</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>By My honored ones [<i>bimekhubadai</i>].</b> God will be sanctified by those considered honored by God when He reveals Himself in the Tabernacle. |
| Exodus 30:2 | “Square” | Zevachim 59b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says: It is stated here</b> that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> that the incense altar was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 30:2). The verbal analogy indicates that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the incense altar, <b>its height</b> was <b>twice its length, so too here,</b> the height of the altar built in the time of Moses was <b>twice its length,</b> i.e., ten cubits. |
| Exodus 30:6 | “there.” | Keritot 5b:18 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> How do we know that all these items needed to be sequestered together with the Ark? The <i>halakha</i> that the jar of manna was to be kept with the Ark is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there.”</b> The word “there” is stated with regard to the Ark: “Where I will meet with you there” (Exodus 30:6), and it is also stated with regard to the manna: “And put there” (Exodus 16:33). |
| Exodus 30:6 | there | Yoma 52b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy, as it is written with regard to the Ark: “That is by the Ark of the Testimony, before the Ark cover that is above the testimony, <b>there</b> will I meet with you” (Exodus 30:6), and it is written: “Take a jar and put a full <i>omer</i> of manna <b>there,</b> and place it before the Lord for safekeeping throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33). <b>And it is</b> further <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy from the term <b>“Generations”</b> written here and <b>“generations”</b> written with regard to the oil used for anointing: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil for Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31). |
| Exodus 30:7 | the incense, an item about which it is stated: “In the morning, in the morning,” as it is written: “And Aaron shall burn upon it incense of sweet spices; in the morning, in the morning, | Pesachim 59a:9 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nothing may precede the daily morning offering but</b> the morning burning of <b>the incense alone, as it is stated about</b> the burning of the incense: <b>“In the morning, in the morning.” And</b> it is derived that <b>the incense, an item about which it is stated: “In the morning, in the morning,” as it is written: “And Aaron shall burn upon it incense of sweet spices; in the morning, in the morning,</b> when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:7), <b>should precede an item,</b> the daily offering, <b>about which only one morning is stated:</b> “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning” (Numbers 28:4). |
| Exodus 30:7 | as it is written: “Every morning when he removes the ashes from the lamps, | Yoma 14b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “Every morning when he removes the ashes from the lamps,</b> he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:7), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“He shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8). First the lamps are cleaned, and only then is the incense burned. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the incense was burned first, interpret this verse? They say: <b>What is the Merciful One saying?</b> |
| Exodus 30:7 | written: “In the morning, in the morning” | Yoma 33a:10 | Abaye continued: <b>The setting up of the two logs precedes the removal of ashes</b> from <b>the inner altar. Although here,</b> with regard to the two logs, <b>it is written: In the morning, in the morning,</b> meaning that the priest must arise early in the morning to perform this act, <b>and here,</b> with regard to removal of the ashes from the inner altar, <b>it is</b> also <b>written: “In the morning, in the morning”</b> (Exodus 30:7), <b>even so,</b> an action that <b>facilitates</b> another service takes <b>precedence.</b> Therefore, setting up the logs, from which coals are taken, facilitating the burning of the incense, precedes removal of ashes from the inner altar. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the act that <b>facilitates?</b> It is the placement of the <b>two logs. But didn’t you say</b> that <b>the two logs go to the large arrangement</b> of wood and not to the arrangement of wood from which the coals are taken for the incense? These logs in no way facilitate the burning of the incense. |
| Exodus 30:7 | the verse states: “When he removes the ashes from the lamps, he shall burn it” | Yoma 33b:10 | The Gemara asks with regard to the sequence in which the priest removes the ashes from the lamps: <b>What is different that he performs the removal of ashes from five lamps first? Let us perform the removal of ashes from two lamps first.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since he begins</b> the service <b>with them, he performs</b> the service on <b>a majority of the</b> lamps. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let him perform</b> the service on <b>six</b> lamps. The Gemara responds that <b>the verse states: “When he removes the ashes from the lamps, he shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:7), <b>and lamps is</b> plural, meaning <b>no fewer than two.</b> Apparently, removal of ashes from lamps must be performed on a minimum of two lamps. |
| Exodus 30:7 | Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said | Yoma 33b:8 | <b>However,</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> the following based on the verse: “And Aaron shall burn upon it incense of sweet spices; in the morning, in the morning, when he removes the ashes from the lamps” (Exodus 30:7); take the term <b>in the morning, in the morning,</b> and <b>divide</b> the service of removal of ashes from the lamps <b>into two mornings,</b> i.e., into two parts, by performing a service in between, <b>what can be said?</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, since the result would be that there is no service demarcating between the five lamps and the two lamps, there is no alternative to interpreting the matter in accordance with the explanation of Abaye. |
| Exodus 30:8 | in the afternoon | Pesachim 59a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that the Paschal lamb is offered after the daily afternoon offering is derived from these verses, then <b>the</b> burning of the <b>incense and the</b> lighting of the <b>lamps</b> of the candelabrum <b>should also precede the</b> offering of the <b>Paschal lamb. The item,</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>about which it is stated “in the evening” and “in the afternoon” should be</b> sacrificed <b>after the item about which it is stated only:</b> “And when Aaron lights the lamps <b>in the afternoon</b> he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:8), which relates to both the burning of the incense and the lighting of the lamps. |
| Exodus 30:8 | lamps, | Pesachim 59a:5 | And the Torah <b>juxtaposes the</b> burning of the <b>incense to the</b> kindling of the <b>lamps,</b> as it explicitly states that the incense is burned at the time the lamps are kindled: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense” (Exodus 30:8). From this it is derived that no other rite is performed in the Temple after burning the incense and lighting the lamps, not even the Paschal lamb. |
| Exodus 30:8 | incense. It could have entered your mind to say that since it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it” | Pesachim 59a:7 | The Gemara asks: As already stated, <b>isn’t “it” written</b> in the verse, from which it is derived that lighting the lamps is the final Temple rite of the day? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> word <b>“it” is necessary,</b> in order <b>to exclude a rite that is</b> performed <b>inside</b> the sanctuary, as opposed to the Paschal lamb, which is sacrificed outside, in the courtyard. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> this rite? The Gemara answers: The burning of the <b>incense. It could have entered your mind to say that since it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8), <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>we should light the lamps first and then we should burn the incense,</b> as the verse does not clearly state which of the two comes first. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One excludes</b> this possibility by use of the word “<b>it,”</b> from which it is derived that no other rite is performed inside the sanctuary after the lamps are kindled. |
| Exodus 30:8 | “He shall burn it” | Yoma 14b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “Every morning when he removes the ashes from the lamps,</b> he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:7), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“He shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8). First the lamps are cleaned, and only then is the incense burned. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the incense was burned first, interpret this verse? They say: <b>What is the Merciful One saying?</b> |
| Exodus 30:8 | which it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it” | Yoma 15a:1 | It means: <b>At the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of the ashes <b>you shall burn the incense,</b> and no later. <b>As, if you do not say so</b> but explain that the phrase: He shall burn the incense, at the end of the verse means after cleaning the lamps, then with regard to the burning of the <b>afternoon</b> incense, with regard to <b>which it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8), in <b>this</b> case <b>too,</b> does it mean that <b>initially</b> the priest <b>lights the lamps and</b> only <b>then burns the afternoon incense? And if you say indeed,</b> that is <b>so, wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Aaron and his sons will set it in order to burn <b>from evening until morning</b> before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21)? |
| Exodus 30:8 | bein ha’arbayim ” | Zevachim 11b:29 | The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>lamps</b> of the Candelabrum, one should say the same, <b>as it is written:</b> “And when Aaron lights the lamps <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day fit</b> for lighting <b>also,</b> according to the opinion of ben Beteira? |
| Exodus 30:8 | as it is written with regard to it: “ Bein ha’arbayim | Zevachim 11b:31 | The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>incense,</b> one should say likewise, <b>as it is written with regard to it: “<i>Bein ha’arbayim</i></b> he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day also fit</b> for burning the incense according to the opinion of ben Beteira? |
| Exodus 30:9 | “You shall bring no strange incense thereon” | Menachot 50a:19 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> contrary to those two inferences: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may voluntarily donate and bring</b> incense <b>similar to</b> the incense brought by the tribal princes to the Temple as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this incense, as in the case of other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:24). Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the inner altar: <b>“You shall bring no strange incense thereon”</b> (Exodus 30:9). This indicates that an individual may not sacrifice incense even on the inner altar. |
| Exodus 30:9 | the verse states: You shall not bring [ lo ta’alu ] | Menachot 50b:1 | <b>but a community may bring</b> incense as a gift offering, <b>as</b> the community <b>does bring its obligatory</b> offering <b>similar to this,</b> i.e., since the community is obligated to sacrifice incense it can also voluntarily sacrifice incense. Therefore, <b>the verse states: You shall not bring [<i>lo ta’alu</i>]</b> strange incense thereon” (Exodus 30:9). The fact that the verse formulates the prohibition with the plural word <i>ta’alu</i> indicates that even the community may not sacrifice incense as a voluntary gift offering. |
| Exodus 30:10 | It does not atone their atonement, | Shevuot 10a:15 | He elaborates: <b>It does not atone their atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara derived from the verse: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year” (Exodus 30:10), the internal goat <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases. And <b>they do not atone its atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara explained, <b>the verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year.”</b> The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for the specific case that it atones for <b>should be only once a year.</b> |
| Exodus 30:10 | once a year” | Shevuot 10a:20 | The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement,</b> i.e., the specific case it atones for, <b>should be only once a year. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone. The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “Once</b> a year,” which indicates that it <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases. |
| Exodus 30:10 | once a year” | Shevuot 10a:3 | <b>And if you would say: Let</b> the goats of the Festivals <b>atone for</b> that which the goat <b>of Yom Kippur</b> is brought, that is not possible. <b>Didn’t we say</b> above that the verse states with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10)? The emphasis on “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for this case <b>should be only once a year.</b> |
| Exodus 30:10 | “Once a year” | Shevuot 10b:4 | The Gemara asks further: <b>What is different</b> about the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals that they do not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“Once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10), which teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for the specific case that it atones for <b>should be only once a year,</b> and therefore no other offering can atone for it. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur should also not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone, as it <b>is written: “Once</b> a year,” which teaches that the goats <b>effect one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two cases. Why then does Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda cite Rabbi Shimon as holding that the goats of Yom Kippur atone for everything that the goats of the Festivals atone for? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>does not learn</b> anything from the word <b>“once.”</b> Accordingly, he holds that the goats of Yom Kippur can atone for three different cases. |
| Exodus 30:10 | as the verse states: “And Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year” | Shevuot 10b:6 | The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he does learn</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the word <b>“once,”</b> and he holds that it also teaches about the capacity of the external goat to atone, as the Gemara explained above. <b>But</b> it <b>is different here,</b> with regard to the derivation that the goat cannot effect two atonements, <b>as the verse states: “And Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on “upon its corners” teaches that it is only with regard to the internal goat, whose blood presentation is performed upon the <b>corners of the internal altar, that it effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases, <b>but</b> the external goat, whose blood presentation is performed upon the corners <b>of the external</b> altar, can effect <b>even two</b> different <b>atonements.</b> |
| Exodus 30:10 | once a year” | Shevuot 8b:10 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> then <b>let</b> the <b>external</b> goat <b>atone</b> both <b>for itself,</b> i.e., for the cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for that which</b> the <b>internal</b> goat normally <b>does</b> atone for, and the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case <b>of</b> the <b>defiling</b> of the Temple or sacrificial foods <b>that occurred between</b> the offering of <b>this</b> goat <b>and that</b> goat. If it occurs after the internal goat’s blood presentation, then the external goat will effect atonement for it. The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on the term “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement,</b> for the specific case that it atones for, <b>should be</b> |
| Exodus 30:10 | once | Shevuot 8b:9 | The Gemara comments: <b>Now,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the two goats <b>with each other</b> to teach that they effect atonement for similar cases. <b>But</b> then <b>let the internal</b> goat <b>atone</b> both <b>for itself,</b> i.e., for the cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for that which</b> the <b>external</b> goat normally atones for, <b>and</b> the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case <b>where,</b> for some reason, the service of the <b>external</b> goat <b>was not performed.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once</b> a year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis of the repeated term “once” teaches that the goat <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases. |
| Exodus 30:10 | it is different here, as it is written “once” | Yoma 57b:14 | The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> it remains possible to explain its ruling, since <b>it is different here, as it is written “once”</b> (Exodus 30:10), which indicates that there must be one act of sprinkling and not two. Consequently, the High Priest must mix the blood to ensure that there is only one presentation. |
| Exodus 30:10 | once | Yoma 58a:1 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> He presents <b>from this</b> one, the bull’s blood, <b>by itself, and</b> he presents <b>from that</b> one, the goat’s blood, <b>by itself</b> and does not mix them. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya said to him: But wasn’t it already stated:</b> “And Aaron shall make atonement upon its corners <b>once</b> a year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement” (Exodus 30:10), which indicates that the High Priest does not present twice? |
| Exodus 30:10 | with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once a year | Yoma 61a:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> meaning the first <i>tanna</i>, i.e., Rabbi Meir, the accepted author of unattributed <i>mishnayot</i>, Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Shimon, <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse:</b> “And Aaron shall make atonement upon its corners once a year; <b>with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once a year</b> he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most sacred to the Lord” (Exodus 30:10). |
| Exodus 30:12 | “When you raise,” | Bava Batra10b:3 | The Gemara discusses other matters concerning charity. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, with what shall the horn of Israel be exalted?</b> God <b>said to him: With</b> the passage of <b>“When you raise,”</b> i.e., Israel will be exalted by way of the donations and charity that they will give, as it is stated: “When you raise the heads of the children of Israel…then shall they give” (Exodus 30:12). |
| Exodus 30:12 | I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul | Berakhot 62b:11 | As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1). Moreover, <b>it is written:</b> “And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <b>and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea”</b> (II Samuel 24:1). The proportional response to David’s calling God an inciter was that He incited David. <b>And when he counted them, he did not take a ransom from them,</b> and he was punished, <b>as it is written: “So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the appointed time”</b> (II Samuel 24:15). |
| Exodus 30:13 | As it is written: “The shekel is twenty gera ” | Bekhorot 50a:3 | § <b>Rava says: The biblical <i>sela</i></b> coins, i.e., the shekels that must be given for the redemption of the firstborn son, <b>are</b> each <b>three and one-third</b> dinars in weight, not four dinars. <b>As it is written: “The shekel is twenty <i>gera</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:13), <b>and we translate</b> “twenty <i>gera</i>” as <b>twenty <i>ma’a</i>. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Six silver <i>ma’a</i></b> equal <b>a dinar.</b> If so, twenty <i>ma’a</i>, which is equal to the <i>sela</i> of the Torah, is worth three and one-third dinars. |
| Exodus 30:16 | as it is stated: “And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, | Berakhot 62b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: He saw the money of atonement</b> that Israel gave when they were counted during the Exodus from Egypt, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel,</b> and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for your souls” (Exodus 30:16). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He saw the Temple, as it is written: “On the mount where the Lord is seen [<i>yera’e</i>]”</b> (Genesis 22:14). |
| Exodus 30:18 | the verse states: “You shall also make a Basin of copper, and the base thereof of copper” | Zevachim 22a:5 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that water from <b>the base of</b> the Basin is unfit? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that water from <b>its base should be</b> fit for priests to <b>sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>just as</b> water from <b>the Basin</b> itself is fit to <b>sanctify</b> their hands and feet. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall also make a Basin of copper, and the base thereof of copper”</b> (Exodus 30:18). The verse indicates that <b>I have equated</b> the base and the Basin only <b>with regard to</b> the requirement that they both be made of <b>copper, but not for another matter.</b> Rather, the base, unlike the Basin, is unfit for sanctification. |
| Exodus 30:19 | raises a contradiction | Arakhin 19b:5 | The <i>Tosefta</i> teaches with regard to one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the weight of my forearm [<i>yad</i>], that Rabbi Yehuda says: He brings a barrel and fills it with water and inserts his <b>forearm up to the elbow.</b> This indicates that the term <i>yad</i> denotes the forearm until the elbow. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yadayim</i> 2:1): Since it is written: “And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands [<i>yedeihem</i>] and their feet” (Exodus 30:19), the priests are obligated to <b>sanctify</b> their <b>hands and feet in the Temple up to the wrist.</b> |
| Exodus 30:19 | from it” | Zevachim 21a:3 | § <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest who wishes <b>to sanctify his hands and feet</b> by dipping them <b>in the Basin</b> rather than letting the water run from it onto them? Must one say that the priest may not do so, since <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet <b>from it”</b> (Exodus 30:19), <b>and not inside it? Or perhaps</b> the priest may <b>even</b> use water still <b>inside it.</b> |
| Exodus 30:20 | as it is written: “Whenever they come to the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water that they shall not die” | Sanhedrin 83b:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the punishment for a priest <b>whose hands and feet are not washed</b> and who performed the Temple service is death at the hand of Heaven. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Whenever they come to the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water that they shall not die”</b> (Exodus 30:20). |
| Exodus 30:20 | to minister” | Zevachim 19b:15 | <b>Rav Samma, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina: And let him sit and sanctify</b> his hands and feet while seated, and in this manner he may sanctify them all at once. Ravina said to him: <b>The verse states:</b> “When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar <b>to minister”</b> (Exodus 30:20), <b>and ministration is</b> performed while <b>standing,</b> as the verse states: “To stand to minister” (Deuteronomy 18:5). Therefore, sanctification must also be performed while standing. |
| Exodus 30:20 | “When they come near | Zevachim 19b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written:</b> The priests must sanctify their hands and feet: <b>“When they come near</b> to the altar to minister” (Exodus 30:20), i.e., when they begin the service in the morning. And <b>what is the reasoning of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon? As it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“When they go into</b> the Tent of Meeting,” indicating that one sanctification suffices for the duration of a priest’s service in the Tent of Meeting. |
| Exodus 30:21 | “And it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations” | Zevachim 19b:8 | <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> there is an alternative answer: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to sanctification of the hands and feet: <b>“And it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations”</b> (Exodus 30:21). From the comparison of Aaron to his children one may derive that <b>anything that is indispensable with regard to his seed,</b> the priests, <b>is indispensable with regard to him,</b> the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service, which only he may perform. But <b>anything that is not indispensable with regard to his seed is not indispensable with regard to him.</b> Therefore, the sanctification of the hands and feet between each rite, which is unnecessary for priests during the daily service, does not disqualify the High Priest’s Yom Kippur service if not done. |
| Exodus 30:23 | flowing myrrh [ mor deror ]” | Chullin 139b:12 | They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the events involving <b>Esther?</b> He replied to them that the verse states: “Then My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? <b>And I will hide [<i>haster astir</i>]</b> My face on that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18). They also asked him: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the greatness bestowed upon <b>Mordecai?</b> He replied: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the anointing oil in the Tabernacle: “And you shall also take the chief spices, of <b>flowing myrrh [<i>mor deror</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:23); <b>and we translate</b> <i>mor deror</i> into Aramaic as: <b><i>Mira dakhya</i>,</b> which resembles the name Mordecai. |
| Exodus 30:23 | this is difficult for the tanna : | Keritot 5a:24 | The Gemara expresses surprise at the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Does the <i>tanna</i></b> come to <b>teach us the tally?</b> Why is it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to state the sum of the amounts? The Gemara answers that <b>this is difficult for the <i>tanna</i>:</b> Since the verse states: “And of aromatic cinnamon half so much, two hundred and fifty, and of aromatic calamus two hundred and fifty” (Exodus 30:23), one might <b>say</b> that the weight of <b>aromatic calamus</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>aromatic cinnamon: Just as half of</b> the amount of <b>aromatic cinnamon</b> is <b>two hundred and fifty, so too,</b> the verse means that <b>half of</b> the amount of <b>aromatic calamus</b> is <b>two hundred and fifty, which</b> would mean that the sum total <b>is two thousand.</b> |
| Exodus 30:23 | of all the spices, as it is stated: “Take you also to yourself the chief spices, of pure myrrh [ mar deror ]” | Megillah 10b:21 | The next section of the verse discusses what will replace the thorns, i.e., Haman: <b>“Shall the cypress [<i>berosh</i>] come up”; this is Mordecai.</b> Why is he called a cypress [<i>berosh</i>]? <b>Because he was called the chief</b> [<b><i>rosh</i></b>] <b>of all the spices, as it is stated: “Take you also to yourself the chief spices, of pure myrrh [<i>mar deror</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:23), <b>and we translate</b> “pure myrrh,” into Aramaic as <b><i>mari dakhei</i>.</b> Mordecai was like <i>mari dakhi</i>, the chief [<i>rosh</i>] of spices, and therefore he is called <i>berosh</i>. |
| Exodus 30:24 | hin is twelve log , as it is written: “And of olive oil a hin ” | Menachot 89a:16 | The Gemara elaborates: Now, one <b><i>hin</i> is twelve <i>log</i>, as it is written: “And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:24), <b>and it is written</b> afterward in the same verse: <b>“Sacred anointing oil, this [<i>zeh</i>] shall be for Me, throughout your generations.”</b> The <b>numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>] of <i>zeh</i> is twelve.</b> Once it is established that one <i>hin</i> is twelve <i>log</i>, it is possible to calculate how may <i>log</i> are in one-half, one-third, and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>. |
| Exodus 30:29 | “Whatever touches them shall be sacred” | Zevachim 87a:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Just as the altar sanctifies</b> items, so too, the ramp and the service vessels sanctify items. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Whatever <b>touches the altar</b> shall be sacred” (Exodus 29:37). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>altar</b> sanctifies items. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>ramp</b> sanctifies items as well? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall anoint…<b>the altar [<i>et hamizbe’aḥ</i>]”</b> (Exodus 40:10), and the addition of the word <i>et</i> serves to include the ramp. With regard to <b>service vessels, from where</b> is it derived that they sanctify items? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to them: <b>“Whatever touches them shall be sacred”</b> (Exodus 30:29). |
| Exodus 30:31 | And that oil remains in existence for the future, as it is stated: “This [ zeh ] shall be a sacred anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations” | Horayot 11b:10 | Apropos the anointing oil, the <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And even a High Priest, son of a High Priest, requires anointing, but one does not anoint a king, son of a king. And if you say: For what</b> reason <b>did they anoint King Solomon</b> (see I Kings, chapter 1), who was the son of a king? It was <b>due to the challenge of Adonijah,</b> who sought to succeed their father David as king. <b>And</b> they anointed <b>Joash due to Athaliah</b> (see II Kings, chapter 11). <b>And</b> they anointed <b>Jehoahaz due to Jehoiakim, who was two years older than he</b> was (see II Kings 23:30). In all these cases, it was necessary to underscore that these men were crowned king. <b>And that oil remains in existence for the future, as it is stated: “This [<i>zeh</i>] shall be a sacred anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations”</b> (Exodus 30:31). <b>The numerical value of <i>zeh</i> is twelve <i>log</i>,</b> indicating that this amount of oil remains intact despite its use. |
| Exodus 30:31 | in existence for the future, as it is stated: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations” | Horayot 11b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And was</b> it merely <b>one miracle</b> that was <b>performed with regard to the anointing oil? But wasn’t it initially</b> only <b>twelve <i>log</i>, and from it the Tabernacle, and its vessels, Aaron, and his sons</b> were <b>anointed</b> for the <b>entire seven days of inauguration, and all of it</b> remains <b>in existence for the future, as it is stated: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations”</b> (Exodus 30:31)? Since the entire existence of the anointing oil is predicated on miracles, it is no wonder that its preparation also involved a miracle. |
| Exodus 30:31 | with the anointing oil, | Keritot 5b:10 | <b>The Master said</b> earlier that Jehu was anointed <b>due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And due to</b> the <b>dispute</b> with <b>Joram, son of Ahab, will we misuse</b> consecrated property by anointing someone unnecessarily <b>with the anointing oil,</b> which is called “a sacred anointing oil” (Exodus 30:31)? After all, kings of the kingdom of Israel do not require anointing. The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to Jehoahaz: They anointed him <b>with pure balsam</b> oil, rather than with the anointing oil. <b>Here too,</b> Elisha anointed Jehu <b>with pure balsam</b> oil, not the anointing oil. |
| Exodus 30:31 | as it is stated: “This [ zeh ] shall be a sacred anointing oil to Me throughout your generations” | Keritot 5b:2 | Rabbi Yehuda adds that this is <b>as it is stated: “This [<i>zeh</i>] shall be a sacred anointing oil to Me throughout your generations”</b> (Exodus 30:31). The word <b><i>zeh</i> has a numerical value [<i>bigimatriya</i>]</b> of <b>twelve,</b> which teaches that the original twelve <b><i>log</i></b> of oil that existed at the outset <b>are</b> extant throughout all the generations. If so, i.e., if such miracles were performed in connection with the oil, it is no wonder that its initial preparation was miraculous. |
| Exodus 30:31 | “generations” | Yoma 52b:14 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy, as it is written with regard to the Ark: “That is by the Ark of the Testimony, before the Ark cover that is above the testimony, <b>there</b> will I meet with you” (Exodus 30:6), and it is written: “Take a jar and put a full <i>omer</i> of manna <b>there,</b> and place it before the Lord for safekeeping throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33). <b>And it is</b> further <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy from the term <b>“Generations”</b> written here and <b>“generations”</b> written with regard to the oil used for anointing: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil for Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31). |
| Exodus 30:32 | according to its composition” | Keritot 3a:3 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Anywhere you find two</b> different <b>prohibitions, and</b> only <b>one</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> is stated for both of them, you should <b>divide</b> the <b>sin offering between them,</b> i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. <b>And what is</b> this case? One who <b>blends the anointing oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness, for purposes other than use in the Temple, <b>and</b> one who <b>applies</b> this anointing oil to the skin of a person, <b>as it is written: “Upon the flesh of man it shall not be applied,</b> neither shall you make any like it <b>according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32). These are two prohibitions, one for applying the oil and the other for blending it, and <b>one <i>karet</i></b> is stated with regard to both, <b>as it is written: “Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people”</b> (Exodus 30:33). |
| Exodus 30:32 | “Its composition” | Keritot 5a:20 | <b>The Master said</b> earlier: One who blends the anointing oil <b>to learn</b> how <b>it</b> was prepared or <b>in order to transfer it to the community</b> for them to use in the Temple is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term: <b>“Its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), written with regard to the oil and the term: <b>“According to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:37), written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>incense. And it is written with regard to</b> the <b>incense</b> in that verse: “You shall not prepare for yourselves,” from which it is inferred that <b>it is</b> incense prepared <b>for yourselves that is prohibited, but</b> if one prepares it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil as well,</b> one who blends it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> is <b>exempt.</b> |
| Exodus 30:32 | oil it is written: “Neither shall you prepare any like it according to its composition” | Keritot 5a:22 | The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil it is written: “Neither shall you prepare any like it according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), which indicates that <b>it is</b> oil prepared precisely <b>like it that is prohibited, but</b> with regard to preparing <b>half of it,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so. By contrast, <b>with regard to incense, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare,</b> according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves” (Exodus 30:37), which teaches that <b>any</b> act of <b>preparing of</b> this <b>incense</b> is prohibited, as it is <b>possible to burn a portion,</b> half of the <i>maneh</i> that must be prepared, <b>in the morning, and a portion in the afternoon.</b> |
| Exodus 30:32 | animals and vessels, as it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied” | Keritot 6b:19 | § The mishna includes in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>And one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who applies the anointing oil to animals or vessels</b> is <b>exempt,</b> and one who applies it <b>to gentiles or to corpses</b> is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one is exempt in the case of <b>animals and vessels, as it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and animals and vessels are not</b> the flesh of <b>a person.</b> It is <b>also</b> clear why one is <b>exempt</b> if he applies it to <b>a corpse, as once someone has died,</b> the body <b>is called a corpse and not a person. But</b> if one applies anointing oil to <b>gentiles why</b> is he <b>exempt? Aren’t they</b> included in the meaning of the term <b>person [<i>adam</i>]?</b> |
| Exodus 30:32 | it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied” | Keritot 6b:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree? Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>they disagree concerning this</b> issue: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is based on the fact that <b>it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and it is written: “Or whoever places any of it upon a stranger,</b> he shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:33). The wording of the prohibition teaches with regard to the liability to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>applying</b> the oil to the skin prohibited by the verse refers to the application of <b>any amount,</b> as there is no specific measure stated in this regard, <b>so too,</b> the act of <b>placing</b> the oil mentioned with regard to <i>karet</i> refers to <b>any amount.</b> |
| Exodus 30:32 | it shall not be applied [ lo yisakh ]” | Keritot 7a:5 | The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: A <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Elazar: Anyone included in</b> the obligation not to <b>apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is</b> likewise <b>included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to apply the oil to him. <b>And anyone not included in</b> the obligation not <b>to apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is not included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>You are saying well,</b> as <b>it is written:</b> “Upon the flesh of a person <b>it shall not be applied [<i>lo yisakh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and</b> you <b>read into</b> the verse: <b><i>Lo yasikh</i>,</b> he shall not apply it to others. This dual reading indicates that one who is commanded not to apply the oil is the same as the one upon whom it is prohibited to apply the oil, as stated by the <i>tanna</i>. |
| Exodus 30:32 | as it is stated: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied” | Keritot 7a:6 | § <b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rava: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a High Priest who took from the anointing oil that is on his head and placed it on his stomach; from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is different between</b> this case and <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a priest who applied <i>teruma</i> oil</b> to himself, <b>the Israelite son of his daughter may rub against [<i>mitaggel</i>]</b> this oil <b>without concern</b> that he might be deriving benefit from <i>teruma</i>? |
| Exodus 30:33 | as it is written: “Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people” | Keritot 3a:3 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Anywhere you find two</b> different <b>prohibitions, and</b> only <b>one</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> is stated for both of them, you should <b>divide</b> the <b>sin offering between them,</b> i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. <b>And what is</b> this case? One who <b>blends the anointing oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness, for purposes other than use in the Temple, <b>and</b> one who <b>applies</b> this anointing oil to the skin of a person, <b>as it is written: “Upon the flesh of man it shall not be applied,</b> neither shall you make any like it <b>according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32).

| Exodus 30:33 | the anointing oil that was prepared by Moses alone, | Keritot 5a:19 | § The mishna’s list of prohibitions for whose unwitting violation one must bring a sin offering includes <b>one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness (see Exodus 30:22–33). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil to learn</b> how <b>it</b> was prepared or <b>to transfer it to the community</b> for them to use in the Temple is <b>exempt.</b> But if he blends the anointing oil in order <b>to apply</b> it to his body he is <b>liable. And one who applies</b> to his body the oil prepared by another is <b>exempt, because he is liable for applying</b> the oil to his body <b>only</b> if he uses <b>the anointing oil that was prepared by Moses alone,</b> in accordance with the verse: “Or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger” (Exodus 30:33), which is referring to that specific oil. |
| Exodus 30:33 | and it is written: “Or whoever places any of it upon a stranger, | Keritot 6b:25 | The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree? Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>they disagree concerning this</b> issue: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is based on the fact that <b>it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and it is written: “Or whoever places any of it upon a stranger,</b> he shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:33). The wording of the prohibition teaches with regard to the liability to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>applying</b> the oil to the skin prohibited by the verse refers to the application of <b>any amount,</b> as there is no specific measure stated in this regard, <b>so too,</b> the act of <b>placing</b> the oil mentioned with regard to <i>karet</i> refers to <b>any amount.</b> |
| Exodus 30:33 | karet , | Makkot 14b:2 | <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion of the Rabbis, since nothing relevant to the topic of intercourse with one’s sister is derived from the term “sister,” <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary</b> in order to derive an unrelated matter, i.e., <b>to divide</b> the various prohibitions and establish liability <b>for</b> either <b>one who blends</b> anointing oil <b>or for one who applies</b> anointing oil to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> if he performed either intentionally, and to bring a sin-offering if he performed either unwittingly, even though only a single punishment of <i>karet</i> is written in the verse: “A man who blends a mixture like it and who places any of it upon a non-priest, and he shall be excised from his people” (Exodus 30:33). |
| Exodus 30:33 | “Or whosoever puts any of it upon a stranger, | Meilah 19a:5 | The Gemara explains that the statement of the <i>baraita</i> is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that these individuals are excluded from the <i>halakha</i> of misuse because <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the anointing oil: <b>“Or whosoever puts any of it upon a stranger,</b> he shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:33). <b>And</b> with regard to the anointing oil, <b>this</b> distinguished person, i.e., the High Priest or the king, is <b>not</b> considered <b>a “stranger,” as he is anointed with it.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even a High Priest and a king are included in the prohibition of misuse. |
| Exodus 30:34 | the Merciful One writes: “Of each there shall be a like weight” | Keritot 5a:26 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: When one weighs</b> these substances, <b>does he weigh</b> the ingredients <b>with</b> a slight <b>surplus,</b> so that they tip the scales, or <b>does he weigh</b> the ingredients <b>with precision?</b> Abaye <b>said to him</b> that <b>the Merciful One writes: “Of each there shall be a like weight”</b> (Exodus 30:34), which indicates a precise measure, <b>and you say</b> it is possible that one weighs the ingredients <b>with a surplus?</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say: The Holy One, Blessed be He, knows</b> the amount of <b>surpluses</b> that should be added. <b>Evidently, there is a surplus</b> involved <b>in these</b> measures. |
| Exodus 30:34 | Rav Huna said: What is the verse | Keritot 6b:7 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>eleven ingredients</b> of the incense <b>were stated</b> by God <b>to Moses at Sinai,</b> as not all of them are specified in the verses. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? “Take for you spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; spices with pure frankincense” (Exodus 30:34). The plural form of the phrase: <b>“Take for you spices”</b> is referring to <b>two</b> ingredients; <b>“stacte, and onycha, and galbanum”</b> are three ingredients; <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>five; and</b> the <b>other</b> mention of <b>“spices”</b> indicates that there are another <b>five,</b> i.e., that one should double the previous total, and <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>ten. And</b> finally, <b>“pure frankincense”</b> is <b>one,</b> and <b>this</b> results in a total of <b>eleven.</b> |
| Exodus 30:34 | “Take you spices” | Yoma 3b:4 | The Gemara rejects this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> instances of <b>taking in general and</b> instances of <b>making in general:</b> Instances of <b>taking in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Take you spices”</b> (Exodus 30:34); and instances of <b>making in general</b> are as in the verse: <b>“Make you two silver trumpets”</b> (Numbers 10:2). <b>However,</b> in <b>these</b> cases of inauguration and of Yom Kippur <b>the verses explicitly</b> teach that the offerings must be <b>from your own</b> property. <b>With regard to</b> the <b>inauguration, now, since it is written: “And to the children of</b> Israel <b>you will speak, saying: Take a goat kid for a sin-offering</b> and an unblemished year-old calf and lamb for burnt-offerings” (Leviticus 9:3), with regard to the verse: <b>“And he said to Aaron: Take you a young calf for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 9:2), <b>why do I</b> need this clear difference between the formulation of the command to the Jewish people and the formulation of the command to Aaron? <b>Learn from it</b> that in this context the phrase: <b>Take you,</b> means <b>from your own</b> property. |
| Exodus 30:36 | “And you shall grind some of it finely” | Keritot 6b:5 | <b>And</b> as for the <b>extra three <i>maneh</i></b> of incense <b>from which the High Priest would bring in his handful</b> required <b>on Yom Kippur, one would place it in the mortar on Yom Kippur eve and grind it thoroughly so that</b> the incense <b>should be extra fine. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states, with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur, that it shall be: <b>“Finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> with regard to all incense: <b>“And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “finely ground”?</b> This teaches that on Yom Kippur one must grind the incense more, <b>in order that it should be extra fine.</b> |
| Exodus 30:36 | Has it not already been stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely” | Yoma 45a:3 | § The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>sacrificed a <i>peras</i>,</b> half of a <i>maneh</i>, of incense <b>in the morning,</b> and a <i>peras</i> in the afternoon, but on this day the High Priest adds an additional handful of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the incense <b>was</b> ground <b>fine</b> as prescribed by the Torah, <b>but</b> on <b>this day it was superfine. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur that it is <b>“finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> does the <b>verse</b> mean to <b>teach</b> by this? <b>Has it not already been stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Rather, it teaches</b> that on Yom Kippur the incense has to be <b>superfine.</b> |
| Exodus 30:37 | “According to its composition” | Keritot 5a:20 | <b>The Master said</b> earlier: One who blends the anointing oil <b>to learn</b> how <b>it</b> was prepared or <b>in order to transfer it to the community</b> for them to use in the Temple is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> via a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term: <b>“Its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), written with regard to the oil and the term: <b>“According to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:37), written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>incense. And it is written with regard to</b> the <b>incense</b> in that verse: “You shall not prepare for yourselves,” from which it is inferred that <b>it is</b> incense prepared <b>for yourselves that is prohibited, but</b> if one prepares it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil as well,</b> one who blends it <b>to transfer it to the community</b> is <b>exempt.</b> |
| Exodus 30:37 | with regard to incense, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare, | Keritot 5a:22 | The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: With regard to</b> the anointing <b>oil it is written: “Neither shall you prepare any like it according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32), which indicates that <b>it is</b> oil prepared precisely <b>like it that is prohibited, but</b> with regard to preparing <b>half of it,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so. By contrast, <b>with regard to incense, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare,</b> according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves” (Exodus 30:37), which teaches that <b>any</b> act of <b>preparing of</b> this <b>incense</b> is prohibited, as it is <b>possible to burn a portion,</b> half of the <i>maneh</i> that must be prepared, <b>in the morning, and a portion in the afternoon.</b> |
| Exodus 30:37 | liable | Keritot 6b:1 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The leftover of the incense,</b> from the three extra <i>maneh</i> each year, would accumulate so that <b>once every sixty or every seventy years they would blend</b> the incense for the new year <b>by halves,</b> i.e., they required only half the usual amount, and the other half would come from the leftover incense. <b>Therefore,</b> a private <b>individual who blended</b> incense <b>by halves</b> in order to smell it is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition: “And the incense that you shall prepare, according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves, it shall be to you sacred for the Lord” (Exodus 30:37). This is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said</b> it <b>in the name of the deputy</b> High Priest. |
| Exodus 30:37 | liable, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare, | Keritot 6b:3 | The Gemara comments: This opinion of the Rabbis <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>the anointing oil that one blended in parts,</b> i.e., in any amount, in order to apply it to the skin, he is exempt, but if one blended the incense to smell it, even in parts, he is <b>liable, as it is written: “And the incense that you shall prepare,</b> according to its composition you shall not prepare for yourselves” (Exodus 30:37). This teaches that <b>any</b> incense of the amount <b>that you prepare</b> for the Sanctuary is prohibited, as <b>it is possible to burn a portion,</b> i.e., one-half of the <i>maneh</i> that must be prepared, <b>in the morning, and a portion in the afternoon.</b> |
| Exodus 30:38 | liable | Keritot 6a:6 | § The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> according to the specifications of the incense used in the Temple service, for purposes other than use in the Temple. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> in order <b>to teach</b> himself how to prepare <b>it or</b> in order <b>to transfer it to the community is exempt</b> from liability. But if he prepares it in order <b>to smell it</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “He who prepares it in order to smell it shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:38). <b>And one who</b> actually <b>smells</b> the incense mixture is <b>exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> and from bringing a sin offering; <b>but he has misused</b> consecrated property, and is therefore liable to bring a guilt offering if he acted unwittingly. |
| Exodus 30:38 | to smell it, he is liable | Pesachim 26a:8 | Apropos this <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara discusses the matter <b>itself. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: The sound</b> of the musical instruments in the Temple and <b>the sight and smell</b> of the incense <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t smell subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prepares the incense</b> mixture in order <b>to teach</b> himself how to prepare it <b>or to transfer it to the community is exempt</b> from punishment. However, if one prepares it in order <b>to smell it, he is liable</b> to receive punishment, as it states in the Torah: “He who makes it in order to smell it shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:38). <b>And one who</b> actually <b>smells</b> the incense mixture is <b>exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> and from bringing a sin-offering; <b>however, he has misused consecrated property.</b> Apparently, the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of consecrated property applies to smelling. |
| Exodus 31:3 | “And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20). We see that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, the qualities with which the heavens and earth were created, are all found in Bezalel. |
| Exodus 31:6 | “And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom” | Berakhot 55a:14 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, only grants wisdom to one who</b> already <b>possesses wisdom, as it is stated: “He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to they who know understanding”</b> (Daniel 2:21). <b>Rav Taḥalifa, from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard</b> this <b>and repeated it before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: You learned</b> proof for this idea <b>from there; we learn it from here: As it is written</b> in praise of the builders of the Tabernacle: <b>“And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom”</b> (Exodus 31:6). |
| Exodus 31:11 | the verse states: “And the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the sacred place; according to all that I have commanded you shall they do” | Menachot 50b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the community <b>may not bring</b> a gift offering of incense <b>on the inner altar, but</b> it <b>may bring</b> incense <b>on the external altar.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the sacred place; according to all that I have commanded you shall they do”</b> (Exodus 31:11). This teaches that one <b>has</b> the right to do <b>only that which is stated with regard to the matter,</b> without deviation. Consequently, incense may sacrificed only by the community, only when there is an obligation to sacrifice it, and it must be burned only on the inner altar. This contradicts the implication of the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted to burn the incense of an individual on the golden altar or the incense of a community on the outer altar. |
| Exodus 31:13 | that you may know that I am the Lord Who sanctifies you” | Beitzah 16a:7 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this. Isn’t it written: “Nevertheless, you must keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, <b>that you may know that I am the Lord Who sanctifies you”</b> (Exodus 31:13), which the Sages expounded as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, I have a good gift in My treasury, and its name is Shabbat, and I wish to give it to the Jewish people. Go and inform them</b> of this intention of Mine. <b>And from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives</b> a gift of <b>a piece of bread to a child must inform his mother</b> of his actions, so that the child’s parents will be aware of the giver’s fond feelings for them, thereby enhancing friendly relations and companionship among Jews. This appears to be in direct contradiction to Rabbi Ḥama’s statement. |
| Exodus 31:13 | to know that I am God Who sanctifies you” | Shabbat 10b:4 | Incidental to the halakhic statement in his name, the Gemara also cites another statement that <b>Rava bar Meḥasseya said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who gives a gift to another must inform him</b> that he is giving it to him. <b>As it is stated:</b> “Only keep My <i>Shabbatot</i> for it is a sign between Me and you for your generations <b>to know that I am God Who sanctifies you”</b> (Exodus 31:13). When the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave Shabbat to Israel, He told Moses to inform them about it. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“For I am God Who sanctifies you,”</b> meaning that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: I have a good gift in My treasure house and Shabbat is its name, and I seek to give it to Israel. Go inform them</b> about it. <b>From here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives</b> a gift of <b>bread to a child needs to inform his mother</b> that he gave it to him. The Gemara asks: <b>What does he do to</b> the child, so that his mother will know that he gave him a gift? <b>Abaye said: He should smear him with oil or place blue shadow around his eye</b> in an obvious manner. When the mother of the child notices and asks him about it, he will tell her that so-and-so gave him a piece of bread. The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we are concerned about witchcraft</b> involving oil or eye shadow, <b>what</b> should one who gives a gift do? <b>Rav Pappa said: He should smear him with</b> food of <b>the same type</b> that he gave him to eat. |
| Exodus 31:13 | sign | Shabbat 132a:6 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>sign</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you” (Genesis 17:11), and <b>sign</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “However, you shall keep My <i>Shabbatot</i>, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations” (Exodus 31:13). From this verbal analogy, it is derived that circumcision, which is a sign, may be performed even on Shabbat, which is itself a sign. |
| Exodus 31:13 | keep my Shabbatot ” | Yoma 85b:2 | Other <i>tanna’im</i> debated this same issue. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that <b>it</b> is stated: “But <b>keep my <i>Shabbatot</i>”</b> (Exodus 31:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>to everyone</b> in all circumstances; therefore, <b>the verse states “but,”</b> a term that restricts and <b>qualifies.</b> It implies that there are circumstances where one must keep Shabbat and circumstances where one must desecrate it, i.e., to save a life. <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says</b> that <b>it</b> is stated: <b>“For it is sacred to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14). This implies that Shabbat <b>is given into your hands, and you are not given to it</b> to die on account of Shabbat. |
| Exodus 31:14 | by death, as it is stated: “Every one that profanes it shall be put to death” | Bava Batra119a:8 | Rabbi Ḥideka continues citing Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni: <b>And Moses our teacher</b> similarly <b>knew that the</b> wood <b>gatherer,</b> who gathered wood on Shabbat (see Numbers 15:32–36), was to be punished <b>by death, as it is stated: “Every one that profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), <b>but he did not know by which death</b> penalty the wood gatherer <b>must die. And the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> concerning the punishment <b>of</b> the wood <b>gatherer was fit to have been written through</b> God initiating a commandment to <b>Moses,</b> to teach which form of court-imposed capital punishment is administered to one who violates Shabbat. <b>But</b> the wood <b>gatherer was</b> found <b>guilty, and</b> the portion was <b>written through</b> the incident involving <b>him.</b> This is <b>to teach you</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | “And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [ kodesh ] to you; | Bava Kamma71a:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar?</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [<i>kodesh</i>] to you;</b> one who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). <b>Just as it is prohibited to eat a sacred</b> item consecrated to the Temple [<i>kodesh</i>], <b>so too is it prohibited to eat</b> food produced though <b>action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | to you” | Bava Kamma71a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps the analogy should be extended: <b>Just as it is prohibited to derive benefit</b> from <b>a sacred</b> item, <b>so too</b> should it be <b>prohibited to derive benefit</b> from a product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “It is holy <b>to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that <b>it shall be yours</b> for deriving benefit. Although food cooked on Shabbat may not be eaten, it is permitted to benefit from it in other ways. |
| Exodus 31:14 | the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death” | Bava Kamma71a:20 | The Gemara further asks: Based on the analogy between a sacred item and the product of an action that desecrates Shabbat, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the action were performed <b>unwittingly</b> it should be prohibited to consume the product, like a sacred item. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <b>with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>intentionally</b> that <b>I said</b> this analogy <b>to you,</b> as the verse clearly is referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <b>but not</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>unwittingly,</b> who is not executed. |
| Exodus 31:14 | that which is written: “And you shall observe the Shabbat” | Chagigah 11b:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so,</b> then what of <b>that which is written: “And you shall observe the Shabbat”</b> (Exodus 31:14), and <b>“And you shall observe the festival of <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17), and <b>“And you shall observe the charge of the sacred things”</b> (Numbers 18:5); <b>so too,</b> will you say that none of these subjects may be taught to three? |
| Exodus 31:14 | “For it is sacred to you” | Chullin 115a:2 | The Gemara answers: A product of the desecration of Shabbat is an exception to the rule, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“For it is sacred to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14). One may infer: <b>It,</b> Shabbat itself, <b>is sacred, but</b> the products of <b>actions</b> that desecrate <b>it are not sacred,</b> i.e., not prohibited. |
| Exodus 31:14 | “And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is sacred to you; | Ketubot 34a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar?</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is sacred to you;</b> he who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14); <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a sacred</b> item consecrated to the Temple, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited, so too,</b> with regard to food produced through <b>action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps the analogy should be extended to include the following: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a sacred item,</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is prohibited, so too,</b> with regard to the product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat,</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it should be <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “It is sacred <b>to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that <b>it shall be yours</b> in the sense that one may derive benefit from it. |
| Exodus 31:14 | the verse states: “He who profanes it shall be put to death” | Ketubot 34a:4 | The Gemara asks: Based on the analogy between actions that desecrate Shabbat and sacred items, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the action was performed <b>unwittingly</b> it should be prohibited to eat its product, as is the case with regard to sacred items. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He who profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <b>with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>intentionally</b> that <b>I stated to you</b> this analogy to sacred items, as the verse is clearly referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <b>and not with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>unwittingly,</b> who is not executed. |
| Exodus 31:14 | “Everyone that desecrates it shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 35b:9 | Rava continues: <b>One student said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that <b>since it is stated:</b> “And <b>if there is in a man a sin deserving of death and he is put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the court administers capital punishment <b>both during the week and on Shabbat. And</b> accordingly, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of what the verse states concerning Shabbat: <b>“Everyone that desecrates it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? One possibility is that the term: Desecration of Shabbat, applies only <b>to other</b> cases in which <b>labor</b> is performed, and <b>excludes</b> instances of <b>the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court,</b> which is not a desecration of Shabbat. <b>Or rather,</b> derive that <b>even the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court</b> is prohibited as desecration of Shabbat. <b>And how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is put to death”?</b> One possibility is that the mitzva of executing transgressors applies <b>on weekdays, but not on Shabbat. Or rather,</b> the other possibility is that it applies <b>even on Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | one who desecrates it shall be put to death” | Sanhedrin 78b:7 | The difference between the uncertainty in the case of the wood gatherer and the uncertainty in the case of the blasphemer is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses our teacher knew that the</b> wood <b>gatherer</b> was liable to be sentenced <b>to death, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall observe the Shabbat as it is sacred to you; <b>one who desecrates it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14). <b>But he did not know with which death</b> penalty <b>he was</b> to be <b>killed, as it is stated:</b> “And they placed him under guard, <b>as it had not been declared</b> what should be done to him” (Numbers 15:34). <b>But</b> concerning the <b>blasphemer it is stated only:</b> “And they placed him under guard <b>that it might be declared to them according to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 24:12), <b>as Moses did not know if</b> the blasphemer <b>was liable to be killed at all, or not.</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | he who desecrates it shall surely die” | Shabbat 132a:22 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> as the <i>tanna</i> interprets the phrase: “On the <b>eighth</b> day <b>he shall be circumcised”</b> to mean that the circumcision must be performed <b>even on Shabbat. And how do I fulfill</b> the prohibition against performing prohibited labor explicit in the Torah in the verse: “And you shall guard the Shabbat, for it is holy to you; <b>he who desecrates it shall surely die”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? That is referring <b>to other prohibited labors besides circumcision.</b> The <i>tanna</i> questions his previous statement: <b>Or perhaps that is not</b> the case, and the prohibition of performing prohibited labor on Shabbat includes <b>even circumcision, and,</b> on the contrary, <b>how do I fulfill</b> the verse: “On the <b>eighth</b> day <b>he shall be circumcised”?</b> It applies when the eighth day is any day <b>other than Shabbat. The verse states: “On the day,”</b> meaning on that very day when he turns eight days old, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> The <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> rejects Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s proof and accepts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s assertion that the phrase “On the day” conclusively establishes that circumcision is performed even on Shabbat. |
| Exodus 31:14 | And it is written with regard to desecrating Shabbat: “Every one that desecrates it [ meḥaleleha ] shall surely be put to death” | Shabbat 33a:3 | <b>Due to the sin of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain and a false oath, and desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, and desecration of Shabbat, wild beasts abound</b> in the world, <b>and</b> domesticated <b>animals cease</b> to exist, <b>and human beings decrease</b> in number, <b>and the roads become desolate, as it is stated: “And if in spite of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>] things you will not be corrected unto Me,</b> but will walk contrary unto Me casually” (Leviticus 26:23). <b>Do not read of these [<i>be</i>’<i>eleh</i>]; rather,</b> due to a vain <b>oath [<i>be</i>’<i>ala</i>]. And it is written</b> that the punishment for this is: <b>“And I will send the beast of the field among you,</b> which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate” (Leviticus 26:22). <b>And it is written with regard to a false oath: “And you shall not swear by My name falsely, so that you desecrate [<i>veḥillalta</i>] the name of your God:</b> I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating the name of God: “And you shall not desecrate [<i>teḥallelu</i>] My Holy Name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32). <b>And it is written with regard to desecrating Shabbat: “Every one that desecrates it [<i>meḥaleleha</i>] shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14). <b>And derive</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] <b>desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of Shabbat from desecration [<i>ḥillul</i>] of a false oath.</b> Just as punishment for a false oath is desolation and wild beasts, one receives the same punishment for desecrating Shabbat and the name of God. |
| Exodus 31:14 | he who desecrates it shall surely die [ mot yumat ]” | Shabbat 70a:2 | We learned in the mishna that <b>one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each prohibited labor</b> that he performs on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>the division of labors?</b> What is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that if one performs numerous prohibited labors on Shabbat in the course of one lapse of awareness, each prohibited labor is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment? <b>Shmuel said</b> that <b>the verse says:</b> “And you shall observe the Shabbat, for it is holy to you; <b>he who desecrates it shall surely die [<i>mot yumat</i>]”</b> (Exodus 31:14). We learn from the double language, <i>mot yumat</i>, that <b>the Torah amplified multiple deaths for a single desecration.</b> Although several violations were committed in the course of a single lapse of awareness, each is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment. The Gemara asks: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to intentional</b> transgression. The Gemara is seeking a source for multiple sacrifices brought for unwitting transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>If it does not</b> refer to <b>the matter</b> of <b>intentional</b> transgression, as the verse does not teach a <i>halakha</i> applicable to intentional acts, <b>as it was</b> already <b>written:</b> “Six days you shall perform work, and on the seventh day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God; <b>all who desecrate</b> it <b>shall die”</b> (Exodus 35:2), <b>refer it to the matter of unwitting</b> transgression. The verse teaches that that which was written with regard to the death penalty for desecration of Shabbat in general applies to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, including cases of unwitting transgression. <b>And what,</b> then, is the meaning of the term: <b>Shall die,</b> in the verse? Does it mean that one who commits an unwitting transgression is punishable by death? It means that <b>he shall die by</b> payment of <b>money.</b> Death is used in the sense of punishment; he will be forced to pay for numerous sacrifices to atone for his sins. |
| Exodus 31:14 | “Every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death” | Yevamot 6b:16 | The Gemara rejects this argument as well. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: This <i>tanna</i></b> does <b>not</b> raise the possibility that a court-administered death penalty might override Shabbat <b>because a positive mitzva comes and overrides a prohibition. Rather,</b> he entertains this option <b>because he learns this by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>and this is what</b> he <b>is saying: How do I establish</b> the verse <b>“Every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? This applies <b>to other</b> prohibited <b>labors, except for court-imposed capital punishment. However,</b> it could be said that <b>court-imposed capital punishment overrides Shabbat, by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: |
| Exodus 31:14 | every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death” | Yevamot 6b:9 | <b>A student said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that <b>since it is stated: “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the death penalty is administered <b>whether on a weekday</b> or <b>on a Shabbat. And how do I establish</b> the verse: “And you shall keep Shabbat, for it is sacred to you; <b>every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? This verse applies <b>to other</b> prohibited <b>labors, except for court-imposed capital punishment,</b> which must be administered even on Shabbat. <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> the case that <b>even court-imposed capital punishment</b> is included in the list of prohibited labors on Shabbat. <b>How,</b> then, <b>do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“And he is put to death”?</b> This is referring <b>to a weekday and not to Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | “Every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death” | Yevamot 7a:5 | The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> It would have been possible to say the following: <b>How do I establish</b> the verse <b>“Every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? This applies <b>to other</b> prohibited <b>labors, except for court-imposed capital punishment. However, court-imposed capital punishment overrides Shabbat, as a positive mitzva comes and overrides a prohibition.</b> |
| Exodus 31:14 | “For it is sacred to you” | Yoma 85b:2 | Other <i>tanna’im</i> debated this same issue. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that <b>it</b> is stated: “But <b>keep my <i>Shabbatot</i>”</b> (Exodus 31:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>to everyone</b> in all circumstances; therefore, <b>the verse states “but,”</b> a term that restricts and <b>qualifies.</b> It implies that there are circumstances where one must keep Shabbat and circumstances where one must desecrate it, i.e., to save a life. <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says</b> that <b>it</b> is stated: <b>“For it is sacred to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14). This implies that Shabbat <b>is given into your hands, and you are not given to it</b> to die on account of Shabbat. |
| Exodus 31:16 | generations | Shabbat 132a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>generations</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “Throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant” (Exodus 31:16), and the word <b>generations</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And I shall establish My covenant between Me and you, and between your seed after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant” (Genesis 17:7). |
| Exodus 31:16 | covenant | Shabbat 132a:8 | <b>Rather,</b> this principle is <b>derived</b> by means of a different verbal analogy from the word <b>covenant</b> that appears with regard to circumcision: “And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you” (Genesis 17:11), and the word <b>covenant</b> that appears with regard to Shabbat: “The children of Israel shall keep the Shabbat, to observe the Shabbat throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant” (Exodus 31:16). |
| Exodus 31:16 | “And the children of Israel observed the Shabbat, | Shabbat 69b:8 | We learned in the mishna that there is a difference in <i>halakha</i> between <b>one who knows the essence of Shabbat</b> and one who does not know it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the Torah <b>are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Two verses are written.</b> One states: <b>“And the children of Israel observed the Shabbat,</b> to perform the Shabbat through their generations, an everlasting covenant” (Exodus 31:16). <b>And it is written: “And you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i></b> and you shall revere My Sanctuary, I am God” (Leviticus 26:2). <b>How</b> is it that Shabbat is in the singular in one verse, while in the other it is in the plural [<i>Shabbatot</i>]? It should be understood as follows: <b>“And the children of Israel observed the Shabbat”: One observance for multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>.</b> If one commits several transgressions, in certain cases he is only liable to bring one sacrifice. <b>“And you shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>”: One observance for each and every Shabbat.</b> In certain cases, one is liable to bring a sin-offering for each time that he unwittingly desecrated Shabbat. |
| Exodus 31:16 | “And the children of Israel shall keep Shabbat, | Yoma 85b:3 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said:</b> It is stated: <b>“And the children of Israel shall keep Shabbat,</b> to observe Shabbat” (Exodus 31:16).<b> The Torah said: Desecrate one Shabbat on his behalf so he will observe many <i>Shabbatot</i>. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If I would</b> have been <b>there</b> among those Sages who debated this question, <b>I would have said</b> that <b>my proof is preferable to theirs,</b> as it states: “You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which a person shall do <b>and live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5), <b>and not that he</b> should <b>die by them.</b> In all circumstances, one must take care not to die as a result of fulfilling the mitzvot. |
| Exodus 31:17 | mitzvot that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave to the Jewish people, He gave to them in public [ parhesya ] except for Shabbat, which he gave to them in private. As it is stated: “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever” | Beitzah 16a:10 | The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to the gift of Shabbat to the Jewish people. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: All</b> the <b>mitzvot that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave to the Jewish people, He gave to them in public [<i>parhesya</i>] except for Shabbat, which he gave to them in private. As it is stated: “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever”</b> (Exodus 31:17), meaning that in a sense, it is a secret between God and the Jewish people. |
| Exodus 31:17 | As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, gives a person an additional soul on Shabbat eve, and at the conclusion of Shabbat removes it from him, as it is stated: “He ceased from work and was refreshed [ vayinafash ]” | Beitzah 16a:12 | <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, gives a person an additional soul on Shabbat eve, and at the conclusion of Shabbat removes it from him, as it is stated: “He ceased from work and was refreshed [<i>vayinafash</i>]”</b> (Exodus 31:17). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish expounds the verse as follows: <b>Since he ceased from work,</b> and now Shabbat has concluded and his additional soul is removed from him, <b>woe [<i>vai</i>]</b> for the additional <b>soul [<i>nefesh</i>]</b> that is <b>lost.</b> |
| Exodus 31:17 | vayinafash | Taanit 27b:9 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> They would not fast on Sunday <b>due to the added soul, as Reish Lakish said: An added soul is given to man on Shabbat eve,</b> and <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat it is removed it from him, as it is stated: “He ceased from work and rested</b> [<b><i>vayinafash</i></b>]” (Exodus 31:17), which he expounds as follows: <b>Since one has rested</b> and Shabbat has passed, <b>woe for the soul [<i>vai nefesh</i>]</b> that is <b>lost,</b> the added soul that each individual relinquishes. Consequently, one is still weak from this loss on Sunday. |
| Exodus 31:18 | that which is written: “Tablets [ luḥot ] of stone” | Eruvin 54a:18 | <b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> further <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Tablets [<i>luḥot</i>] of stone”</b> (Exodus 31:18)? <b>If a person makes his cheeks [<i>leḥayav</i>] like this stone that does not wear away, his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not,</b> i.e., if he is not diligent in his studies, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b> |
| Exodus 31:18 | And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Initially, Moses would study Torah and forget it, until it was given to him as a gift, as it is stated: “And He gave it to Moses when he concluded speaking with him” | Nedarim 38a:16 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Initially, Moses would study Torah and forget it, until it was given to him as a gift, as it is stated: “And He gave it to Moses when he concluded speaking with him”</b> (Exodus 31:18). Once the Torah was given him as a gift, it became his and he was able to remember it. |
| Exodus 32:1 | “For as for this Moses, the man | Menachot 53b:4 | Rabbi Ezra stated yet another homily structured in a similar manner. <b>Let this one come and receive this from this One for this people.</b> He explained: <b>Let this one come; this is</b> referring to <b>Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“For as for this Moses, the man</b> who brought us up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:1). <b>And receive this; this is</b> referring to the <b>Torah, as it is written: “And this is the Torah which Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44). <b>From this One; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <b>For this people; these</b> people <b>are the Jews, as it is stated</b> about them: <b>“This people that You have gotten”</b> (Exodus 15:16). |
| Exodus 32:1 | which is written: “And the people saw that Moses delayed [ boshesh ] | Shabbat 89a:6 | And <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the people saw that Moses delayed [<i>boshesh</i>]</b> to come down from the mount” (Exodus 32:1)? <b>Do not read</b> the word in the verse as <b><i>boshesh</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>ba’u shesh</i>, six</b> hours <b>have arrived. When Moses ascended on High, he told</b> <b>the Jewish people: In forty days, at the beginning of six</b> hours, <b>I will come. After forty days, Satan came and brought confusion to the world</b> by means of a storm, and it was impossible to ascertain the time. Satan <b>said to</b> the Jews: <b>Where is your teacher Moses?</b> They <b>said to him: He ascended on High.</b> He <b>said to them: Six</b> hours <b>have arrived</b> and he has not yet come. Surely he won’t. <b>And they paid him no attention.</b> Satan said to them: Moses <b>died. And they paid him no attention.</b> Ultimately, <b>he showed them an image of his</b> death-<b>bed</b> and an image of Moses’ corpse in a cloud. <b>And that is what</b> the Jewish people <b>said to Aaron: “For this Moses, the man</b> who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him” (Exodus 32:1). |
| Exodus 32:4 | These are your gods, O Israel” | Avodah Zarah53b:10 | The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps it is</b> only <b>with regard to the</b> Golden <b>Calf that</b> the Jewish people <b>were amenable</b> to worshipping it, but <b>not with regard to</b> any <b>other</b> type of idol worship. The Gemara counters: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Golden Calf: “And they said: <b>These are your gods, O Israel”</b> (Exodus 32:4), in the plural. This <b>teaches that they desired many gods,</b> and they did not desire to worship only the Golden Calf. |
| Exodus 32:5 | Calf, as it is stated: “And Aaron saw this, and he built [ vayyiven ] an altar [ mizbe’aḥ ] before it… | Sanhedrin 7a:3 | § <b>And</b> the various Sages who offered interpretations of the verse: “And the covetous blesses himself, though he despises the Lord” (Psalms 10:3), <b>disagree with</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai. As Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: This verse was stated only with regard to the incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf, as it is stated: “And Aaron saw this, and he built [<i>vayyiven</i>] an altar [<i>mizbe’aḥ</i>] before it…</b>and said: Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord” (Exodus 32:5). <b>What</b> did Aaron <b>see? Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He saw Hur, who</b> had been appointed together with Aaron by Moses to lead the people during Moses’ absence (see Exodus 24:14), <b>slaughtered before him,</b> as he had protested the plan to fashion a calf and had been murdered by the people as a result. The verse is therefore interpreted not as: Aaron built an altar before the calf, but rather: He understood [<i>vayyaven</i>] from the slaughter [<i>mizavuaḥ</i>] before his own eyes; and he then called for a feast. |
| Exodus 32:7 | “And the Lord said to Moses: Go and descend, | Berakhot 32a:14 | The Gemara elaborates upon additional aspects of the sin of the Golden Calf. It is stated: <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: Go and descend,</b> for your people whom you have lifted out of the land of Egypt have been corrupted” (Exodus 32:7). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“go and descend”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, descend from your greatness. Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel,</b> so that you may serve as an emissary, <b>that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I</b> need <b>you?</b> There is no need for an emissary. <b>Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak</b> in defense of Israel. <b>And once</b> God <b>said</b> to Moses: <b>“Leave Me be, that I may destroy them”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:14), <b>Moses said</b> to himself: If God is telling me to let Him be, it must be because <b>this matter is dependent upon me. Immediately Moses stood and was strengthened in prayer, and asked</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on the nation of Israel and forgive them for their transgression. |
| Exodus 32:8 | “They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made them | Sanhedrin 56b:10 | <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> both give answers to this question. <b>One</b> of them <b>says</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made them</b> a molten calf” (Exodus 32:8). The word “commanded” is mentioned here in the context of idol worship. <b>And</b> the other <b>one says</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in justice, because he willingly went after filth [<i>tzav</i>]”</b> (Hosea 5:11). The word <i>tzav</i>, used in this context in reference to idol worship, is the same Hebrew word used in the phrase: “And…commanded [<i>vaytzav</i>].” |
| Exodus 32:8 | and have bowed to it, and have sacrificed to it, and said: | Sanhedrin 63a:14 | Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us that</b> he is obligated to bring an offering, as the Torah <b>compares</b> the acceptance of an idol as a god to a case of active idol worship; <b>as it is written:</b> “They have made themselves a molten calf, <b>and have bowed to it, and have sacrificed to it, and said:</b> These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:8). |
| Exodus 32:10 | “Now leave Me be, that My wrath will be enraged against them and I will consume them; and I will make of you a great nation” | Berakhot 32a:16 | In an additional aspect of the sin of the Golden Calf, God told Moses: <b>“Now leave Me be, that My wrath will be enraged against them and I will consume them; and I will make of you a great nation”</b> (Exodus 32:10). Explaining this verse, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it would be impossible to utter</b> it, in deference to God. The phrase: Leave Me be, <b>teaches that Moses grabbed the Holy One, Blessed be He, as a person who grabs his friend by his garment</b> would, <b>and he said before Him: Master of the Universe, I will not leave You be until You forgive and pardon them.</b> |
| Exodus 32:11 | [ titḥolel ] as it is written: “And Moses besought [ vayeḥal ] the Lord” | Berakhot 30b:9 | The Gemara points out that both Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda based their positions on the prayers of Moses. <b>The one who said: So that his mind will be in a pleading</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥonen</i>], as it is written: “And I pleaded [<i>va’etḥanan</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And the one who said: So that his mind will be in a beseeching</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥolel</i>] as it is written: “And Moses besought [<i>vayeḥal</i>] the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). |
| Exodus 32:11 | “And Moses beseeched [ vayḥal ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 32a:19 | The Torah continues: <b>“And Moses beseeched [<i>vayḥal</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11). Many interpretations were given for this uncommon term, <i>vayḥal</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It <b>teaches that Moses stood in prayer before the Holy One, Blessed be He, until it made him ill [</b><i>heḥelahu</i><b>]</b> from overexertion. <b>And Rava said:</b> Moses stood in prayer <b>until he nullified His vow,</b> as the term <i>vayḥal</i> alludes to nullification of an oath. <b>Here it is written <i>vayḥal</i>, and there</b> referring to vows, <b>it is written: “He shall not nullify [<i>lo yaḥel</i>] his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And</b> with regard to vows, <b>the Master said: He</b> who vowed <b>cannot nullify</b> his vow, <b>but others,</b> the court, <b>can nullify</b> his vow <b>for him.</b> Here, it is as if Moses nullified the Lord’s vow to destroy Israel. |
| Exodus 32:13 | upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, | Berakhot 10b:12 | The Gemara cites proof from Moses. When he prayed to God for forgiveness after the incident of the Golden Calf, <b>he based</b> his request <b>upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants,</b> to whom You swore upon Yourself, and told them: I will increase your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants and they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13). Yet when this story is related, God’s forgiveness of Israel <b>is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them”</b> (Psalms 106:23). |
| Exodus 32:13 | “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel Your servants, to whom You swore in Your name” | Berakhot 32a:24 | As Moses continues his prayer, he says: <b>“Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel Your servants, to whom You swore in Your name”</b> (Exodus 32:13). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>in Your name? Rabbi Elazar said: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, had You sworn to them by the heavens and the earth, I would say: Just as the heavens and the earth will</b> ultimately <b>be no more, so too Your oath will be null and void. Now that You swore to them by Your great name, just as Your name lives and stands for all eternity, so too does Your oath live and stand for all eternity.</b> |
| Exodus 32:13 | were not answered. And when he said: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants” | Shabbat 30a:5 | <b>And that which Solomon said: “And I praised the dead that are already dead”;</b> he was not speaking of all dead people, but rather in praise of certain dead people. <b>As when Israel sinned in the desert, Moses stood before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and he said several prayers and supplications before Him, and</b> his prayers <b>were not answered. And when he said: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants”</b> (Exodus 32:13), his prayers <b>were answered immediately.</b> Consequently, <b>did Solomon not speak appropriately</b> when <b>he said: “Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead”?</b> Certainly the merit of the deceased forefathers is greater than that of the righteous people who are alive. <b>Alternatively, the way of the world</b> is such that when <b>a flesh-and-blood prince issues a decree</b> on the public it is <b>uncertain whether they fulfill it</b> and <b>uncertain whether they do not fulfill it. And</b> even <b>if you want to say</b> that <b>they fulfill it, it</b> is only <b>during his lifetime</b> that <b>they fulfill it; after he dies they do not fulfill it. But Moses our teacher issued several decrees and instituted several ordinances, and they are in effect forever and ever. And,</b> if so, <b>is it not appropriate</b> that which <b>Solomon said: “Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead”?</b> |
| Exodus 32:14 | It is written here: “ Vayyinaḥem ,” and it is written there: “And the Lord regretted [ vayyinaḥem ] the evil that He thought to do to His people” | Sanhedrin 108a:16 | <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” has a different meaning: <b>I did not do well that I prepared graves for</b> people <b>in the earth,</b> as I should not have created them in order to destroy them. From where is it inferred that the term “<i>vayyinaḥem</i>” has a negative connotation? <b>It is written here: “<i>Vayyinaḥem</i>,” and it is written there: “And the Lord regretted [<i>vayyinaḥem</i>] the evil that He thought to do to His people”</b> (Exodus 32:14). |
| Exodus 32:15 | “On this [ zeh ] side and on the other [ zeh ] side were they written” | Megillah 15a:12 | The verse continues to relate that Esther sent Hathach to Mordecai after hearing about the decree: <b>“To know what this [<i>zeh</i>] was, and why it [<i>zeh</i>] was”</b> (Esther 4:5). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Esther <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Mordecai, saying: <b>Perhaps the Jews have transgressed the five books of the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the two tablets: <b>“On this [<i>zeh</i>] side and on the other [<i>zeh</i>] side were they written”</b> (Exodus 32:15). |
| Exodus 32:16 | engraved upon the tablets” | Eruvin 54a:19 | <b>And,</b> lastly, <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written:</b> “And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, <b>engraved upon the tablets”</b> (Exodus 32:16)? This teaches that <b>had the first tablets,</b> the subject of this verse, <b>not been broken, the Torah would never have been forgotten from the Jewish people,</b> as the Torah would have been engraved upon their hearts. |
| Exodus 32:19 | and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount” | Taanit 28b:10 | <b>On the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> Moses <b>descended, came,</b> observed the people worshipping the Golden Calf, <b>and broke the tablets. And it is written: “And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf</b> and the dancing, and Moses’ anger burned, <b>and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount”</b> (Exodus 32:19). This shows that the tablets were shattered on the seventeenth of Tammuz. |
| Exodus 32:20 | and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it” | Avodah Zarah44a:2 | The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> You seek to bring <b>proof from there? Doesn’t it state</b> in the verse: “And he took the calf that they had made, and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, <b>and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it”</b> (Exodus 32:20)? Moses ground up the calf <b>intending only to inspect them like <i>sota</i> women,</b> i.e., like a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful. Such a woman is compelled to drink water containing the ground-up ink from a scroll of Torah passages relating to a <i>sota</i> woman, which causes her to die if she was unfaithful, and exonerates her and bestows blessings upon her if she was faithful. Similarly, Moses ground up the calf in order to compel the people to drink, to cause the guilty parties to die. |
| Exodus 32:21 | from “And Moses said | Megillah 25b:11 | The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf is read but not translated.</b> <i>Egel</i>, the Hebrew word for calf, begins with an <i>ayin</i>, the second letter in the mnemonic.

| Exodus 32:24 | “And I cast it into the fire and this calf came forth” | Megillah 25b:12 | With regard to Aaron’s account, the Gemara cites that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A person should always be careful in</b> the way he formulates <b>his responses,</b> as sometimes the explanation that a person provides for his actions is worse than the original action itself, <b>as,</b> for example, <b>based on Aaron’s response to Moses, the skeptics renounced</b> their religious beliefs. <b>It is stated</b> in Aaron’s response: <b>“And I cast it into the fire and this calf came forth”</b> (Exodus 32:24). This formulation implies that the calf came from the fire by itself, suggesting that it had divine power and substance. |
| Exodus 32:25 | until “And Moses saw” | Megillah 25b:11 | The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf is read but not translated.</b> <i>Egel</i>, the Hebrew word for calf, begins with an <i>ayin</i>, the second letter in the mnemonic.

| Exodus 32:25 | was wild [ paru’a ], | Shabbat 119b:5 | Apropos the reward for honoring Shabbat, the Gemara cites statements about the reward for answering amen. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>anyone who answers: Amen, may His great name be blessed,</b> wholeheartedly, <b>with all his might,</b> they <b>rip his sentence, as it is stated: “When punishments are annulled in Israel, when the people offer themselves, bless the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:2). <b>What is the reason for when punishments are annulled? Because</b> the Jewish people <b>blessed God.</b> When one recites: Amen, may His great name be blessed, and blesses God, his punishment is annulled. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>one has within him a trace of idolatry,</b> when he answers amen <b>he is forgiven. It is written here,</b> in the verse above: <b>“When punishments [<i>pera’ot</i>] are annulled.” And it is written there,</b> with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: “And Moses saw <b>that</b> the nation <b>was wild [<i>paru’a</i>],</b> for Aaron had let them loose for anyone who might rise against them” (Exodus 32:25). Even one with the wildness of idolatry is forgiven. <b>Reish Lakish said: One who answers amen with all his strength, they open the gates of the Garden of Eden before him, as it is stated: “Open the gates, and a righteous nation shall come who keeps the faith”</b> (Isaiah 26:2). <b>Do not read: Who keeps [<i>shomer</i>] the faith [<i>emunim</i>], but rather: Who say [<i>she’omerim</i>] amen. What</b> is the allusion of the word <b><i>amen</i>? Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> It is an acronym of the words: <b>God, faithful King [<i>El Melekh ne’eman</i>].</b> |
| Exodus 32:26 | tribe of Levi did not engage in idol worship, as it is stated: “Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, | Yoma 66b:15 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: The</b> entire <b>tribe of Levi did not engage in idol worship, as it is stated: “Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp,</b> and said: Who is for God, let him come to me; and all the children of Levi gathered to him” (Exodus 32:26). |
| Exodus 32:30 | atonement | Yoma 37a:1 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that the confession must begin with the word <b>please? It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated there,</b> just before Moses’s plea following the sin of the Golden Calf <b>at Horeb:</b> “Perhaps I may secure <b>atonement</b> for your sin” (Exodus 32:30). <b>Just as there,</b> the prayer includes: <b>“Please,</b> this people is guilty of a great sin” (Exodus 32:31), <b>so too here,</b> the term <b>please</b> should be used. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the Yom Kippur confession includes <b>the name</b> of God? <b>It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken: “Atone,</b> O God, for Your nation of Israel whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among Your people Israel, and they will be atoned of bloodguilt” (Deuteronomy 21:8). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the heifer, <b>the name</b> of God is mentioned, <b>so too here, the name</b> of God is mentioned. |
| Exodus 32:31 | Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, | Arakhin 15b:18 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anyone who speaks malicious speech increases</b> his <b>sins</b> to the degree that they <b>correspond</b> to the <b>three</b> cardinal <b>transgressions: Idol worship, and forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed.</b> This can be derived from a verbal analogy based on the word “great.” <b>It is written here:</b> “May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, <b>the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>And it is written with regard to idol worship:</b> “And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: <b>Oh, this people have sinned a great sin,</b> and have made for themselves a god of gold” (Exodus 32:31). |
| Exodus 32:31 | “Please, | Yoma 37a:1 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that the confession must begin with the word <b>please?

| Exodus 32:31 | Please, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves a god of gold” | Yoma 86b:14 | Furthermore, during confession, <b>one must detail the sin</b> he committed and not suffice with a general admission of sin, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Moses returned to the Lord and said: <b>Please, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves a god of gold”</b> (Exodus 32:31); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the verse states: <b>“Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden”</b> (Psalms 32:1), which teaches that one need not detail his sins. <b>But what is</b> the meaning of that <b>which Moses said: “And have made themselves a god of gold”</b> (Exodus 32:31)? It should be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yannai, as Rabbi Yannai said: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the universe,</b> it is the <b>silver and gold that you gave to the Jewish people in abundance, until they said: Enough,</b> which <b>caused them to make a god of gold.</b> Consequently, the phrase: “And have made themselves a god of gold,” is not a description of the sin but an explanation and justification of it. |
| Exodus 32:32 | as it is stated: “And if not, erase me, please, from Your book” | Berakhot 32a:20 | <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The term <i>vayḥal</i> <b>teaches that</b> Moses <b>gave his life,</b> from the term <i>ḥalal</i>, a dead person, <b>for</b> Israel, <b>as it is stated: “And if not, erase me, please, from Your book”</b> (Exodus 32:32). |
| Exodus 32:32 | from here: “And if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book which you have written” | Rosh Hashanah16b:14 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This matter is derived <b>from here: “And if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book which you have written”</b> (Exodus 32:32). <b>“Blot me, I pray You”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>wicked</b> people, who are blotted out from the world. <b>“Out of Your book”; this is the book of</b> wholly <b>righteous</b> people, which is special and attributed to God Himself. <b>“Which You have written”; this is the book of middling</b> people. |
| Exodus 32:32 | and if not, blot me, I pray | Sotah 14a:9 | Rabbi Samlai proceeds to expound the verse <b>“Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great”</b> to mean that he will receive reward. One <b>might</b> have thought that he will receive reward <b>like the later ones and not like the earlier ones,</b> so <b>the verse states: “And he shall divide the spoil with the mighty,”</b> meaning <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were mighty in Torah and in mitzvot. “Because he bared his soul unto death,”</b> meaning <b>he gave himself over to death</b> on behalf of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Yet now, if You will forgive their sin; <b>and if not, blot me, I pray</b> You, out of Your book that You have written” (Exodus 32:32). |
| Exodus 32:34 | as it is stated: “On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them” | Sanhedrin 102a:15 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: Until Jeroboam, Israel was suckling,</b> i.e., suffering the consequences, <b>from</b> worshipping <b>one calf</b> that they fashioned in the wilderness. <b>From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> they were suckling <b>from two and three calves,</b> as Jeroboam added the calves in Bethel and Dan. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: You have no punishment that comes to the world in which there is not one twenty-fourth of the surplus of a <i>litra</i> of the first calf.</b> When weighing a substance, there would often be a disparity of up to one twenty-fourth of its weight. The point is that a minuscule portion of the sin of the Golden Calf is added to every punishment imposed upon the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them”</b> (Exodus 32:34), indicating that atonement for that sin is incomplete, and the Jewish people will continue to suffer for it. |
| Exodus 32:34 | “On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them” | Sanhedrin 102a:5 | The verse states: <b>“At the time of their punishment, they shall perish”</b> (Jeremiah 51:18). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at the time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“In an acceptable time have I answered you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “in an acceptable time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for good.</b> The verse states: <b>“On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them”</b> (Exodus 32:34). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “on the day when I punish” indicates that <b>it is a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass at that time, and Judah descended from his brothers”</b> (Genesis 38:1). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at that time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> |
| Exodus 33:6 | “And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward” | Shabbat 88a:7 | <b>Rabbi Simai taught: When Israel accorded precedence</b> to the declaration <b>“We will do”</b> over the declaration <b>“We will hear,” 600,000 ministering angels came</b> and <b>tied two crowns to each and every member of the Jewish people, one corresponding to “We will do” and one corresponding to “We will hear.” And when the people sinned</b> with the Golden Calf, <b>1,200,000 angels of destruction descended and removed them</b> from the people, <b>as it is stated</b> in the wake of the sin of the Golden Calf: <b>“And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward”</b> (Exodus 33:6). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: At Horeb they put on</b> their ornaments, <b>and at Horeb they removed</b> them. The source for this is: <b>At Horeb they put them on, as we have said; at Horeb they removed them, as it is written: “And the children of Israel stripped themselves</b> of their ornaments from Mount Horeb.” <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And Moses merited all</b> of these crowns <b>and took</b> them. What is the source for this? <b>Because juxtaposed to this</b> verse, it is stated: <b>“And Moses would take the tent [<i>ohel</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:7). The word <i>ohel</i> is interpreted homiletically as an allusion to an aura or illumination [<i>hila</i>]. <b>Reish Lakish said: In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return them to us, as it is stated: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads”</b> (Isaiah 35:10). <b>The joy that</b> they <b>once</b> had will once again be <b>upon their heads.</b> |
| Exodus 33:7 | “Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, | Berakhot 63b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, head of the speakers in every place, opened</b> his speech <b>in honor of Torah, and taught:</b> It is stated: <b>“Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp,</b> far off from the camp; and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it came to pass, that every seeker of God went out unto the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp” (Exodus 33:7). He said: <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference?

| Exodus 33:7 | as it is stated: “And Moses would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp” | Sanhedrin 110a:5 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And Moses heard and he fell on his face”</b> (Numbers 16:4), the Gemara asks: <b>What report did he hear</b> that elicited that reaction? <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> He heard <b>that they suspected him</b> of adultery <b>with a married woman, as it is stated: “And they were jealous of Moses in the camp”</b> (Psalms 106:16). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that each and every</b> man <b>warned his wife</b> to distance herself <b>from Moses</b> and not enter into seclusion with him, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp”</b> (Exodus 33:7).

| Exodus 33:8 | “And they looked after Moses until he was gone into the tent” | Kiddushin 33b:15 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the mitzva of standing before a Torah scholar. With regard to the verse: <b>“And they looked after Moses until he was gone into the tent”</b> (Exodus 33:8), <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> disputed its correct interpretation. <b>One said</b> that this is stated <b>unfavorably, and one said</b> that it is meant <b>favorably.

| Exodus 33:11 | “And the Lord spoke unto Moses, face to face” | Berakhot 63b:7 | The Gemara continues: It is stated: <b>“And the Lord spoke unto Moses, face to face”</b> (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, you and I will show cheerful faces in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i></b> to those who come to study. <b>Some say</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Just as I showed you a cheerful face, so too you will show Israel a cheerful face and restore the tent to its place</b> in the camp. |
| Exodus 33:11 | “And he would return into the camp; | Berakhot 63b:8 | It is said: <b>“And he would return into the camp;</b> but his minister, Joshua bin-Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent” (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Now,</b> they will say: <b>The Master,</b> God, <b>is angry and</b> the <b>student,</b> Moses, is also <b>angry, and what will happen to Israel?</b> Rather, you must restore the tent to its place among the people. <b>If you restore the tent to its place, fine; and if not, Joshua bin-Nun, your student,</b> will <b>serve</b> as Israel’s leader <b>in your place.</b> |
| Exodus 33:11 | and his servant Joshua, son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the Tent” | Menachot 99b:19 | The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement of Rabbi Yishmael’s <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This verse is neither an obligation nor a mitzva, but a blessing.</b> Rabbi Yonatan explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, saw Joshua</b> and observed <b>that</b> the <b>words of Torah were very precious to him, as it is stated:</b> “And the Lord spoke to Moses face-to-face…<b>and his servant Joshua, son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the Tent”</b> (Exodus 33:11). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Joshua: <b>Joshua, are</b> the <b>words of Torah so precious to you?</b> I bless you that <b>“this Torah scroll shall not depart from your mouth.”</b> |
| Exodus 33:11 | “But his minister, Joshua, son of Nun, a young man, did not depart out of the tent” | Temurah 16a:6 | § <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Just before <b>the time when Moses, our teacher, left</b> this world and went <b>to the Garden of Eden, he said to Joshua: Ask from me all</b> the cases of <b>uncertainty</b> in matters of <i>halakha</i> <b>that you have,</b> so that I can clarify them for you. Joshua <b>said to him: My teacher, did I</b> ever <b>leave you</b> for even <b>one moment and go to another place?

If I would have had any case of uncertainty I would have asked you earlier. <b>Immediately</b> after he said this, <b>Joshua’s strength weakened, and three hundred <i>halakhot</i> were forgotten by him, and seven hundred</b> cases of <b>uncertainty emerged before him, and the entire Jewish people arose to kill him,</b> as he was unable to teach them the forgotten <i>halakhot</i>. |

| Exodus 33:14 | “My face will go, and I will give you rest” | Berakhot 7a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one must not placate a person while</b> he is in the throes of <b>his anger,</b> rather he should mollify him after he has calmed down? <b>As it is written,</b> when following the sin of the Golden Calf, Moses requested that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel as it had previously, God said to him: <b>“My face will go, and I will give you rest”</b> (Exodus 33:14). Rabbi Yoḥanan explained: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses: <b>Wait until My face of wrath will pass and I will grant your</b> request. One must wait for a person’s anger to pass as well. |
| Exodus 33:14 | his anger? As it is stated: “My face will go, and I will give you rest” | Berakhot 7b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one must not placate a person while</b> the person in the throes of <b>his anger? As it is stated: “My face will go, and I will give you rest”</b> (Exodus 33:14). |
| Exodus 33:15 | as it is written: “And he said to him: If Your Presence go not with me | Sanhedrin 38b:20 | The heretic said to him: <b>If so,</b> if this angel is equated with God, <b>we should worship him</b> as we worship God. Rav Idit said to him: It <b>is written: “Do not defy [<i>tammer</i>] him,”</b> which alludes to: <b>Do not replace Me [<i>temireni</i>] with him.</b> The heretic said to him: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the clause <b>“For he will not pardon your transgression”?</b> Rav Idit <b>said to him: We believe that we did not accept</b> the angel <b>even as a guide [<i>befarvanka</i>]</b> for the journey, <b>as it is written: “And he said to him: If Your Presence go not with me</b> raise us not up from here” (Exodus 33:15). Moses told God that if God Himself does not accompany the Jewish people they do not want to travel to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Exodus 33:16 | “For in what shall it be known here [ eifo ]” | Bava Batra15a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>Moses wrote his own book,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>the portion of Balaam, and</b> the book of <b>Job. This supports Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma, as Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma says: Job</b> lived <b>in the time of Moses. It is written here</b> with regard to Job: <b>“Oh, that my words were written now [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is written there</b> in Moses’ words to God: <b>“For in what shall it be known here [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:16). The unusual use of the word <i>eifo</i> in these two places indicates that Job and Moses lived in the same generation. |
| Exodus 33:16 | was granted to him, as it is stated: “That we shall be differentiated, I and Your people, | Bava Batra15b:8 | And what is the proof that all these <i>tanna’im</i> maintain that Job was Jewish? <b>As if it should enter your mind</b> to say that he came <b>from the nations of the world,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>After Moses died, did the Divine Presence rest</b> any longer <b>on the nations of the world? But doesn’t the Master say: Moses requested that the Divine Presence not rest</b> again <b>on the nations of the world, and</b> his request <b>was granted to him, as it is stated: “That we shall be differentiated, I and Your people,</b> from all the people that are upon the face of the earth” (Exodus 33:16), and it is stated there that God acceded to his request. |
| Exodus 33:16 | Is it not in that You go with us, | Berakhot 7a:23 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei</b> regarding Moses’ request that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel as it once had: Moses <b>requested three things from the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> at that time, <b>all of which were granted him. He requested that the Divine Presence rest upon Israel</b> and not leave, <b>and He granted</b> it <b>to him, as it is stated:</b> “For how can it be known that I have found grace in Your sight, I and Your people? <b>Is it not in that You go with us,</b> so that we are distinguished, I and Your people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth?” (Exodus 33:16). The request: Is it not in that You go with us, refers to the resting of the Divine Presence upon Israel. |
| Exodus 33:16 | to him, as it is stated: “So that we are distinguished, I and Your people, | Berakhot 7a:24 | Moses <b>requested that the Divine Presence not rest upon the nations of the world, and He granted</b> it <b>to him, as it is stated: “So that we are distinguished, I and Your people,</b> from all the people on the face of the earth” (Exodus 33:16). |
| Exodus 33:19 | As it is said: “And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” | Berakhot 7a:29 | Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, that God granted Moses all three of his requests, <b>disagrees with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir said: Two</b> of Moses’ requests <b>were granted to him, and one was not granted to him.</b> God granted him that the Divine Presence would rest upon Israel and not leave, and that the Divine Presence would not rest upon the nations of the world, but God did not reveal to Moses the ways in which He conducts the world. <b>As it is said: “And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious”</b> (Exodus 33:19); in His mercy, God bestows His grace upon every person, <b>even though he is not worthy.</b> Similarly, God says: <b>“And I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy,” even though he is not worthy.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the way in which God conducts the world and bestows grace and mercy was not revealed even to Moses. |
| Exodus 33:20 | “And He said: ‘You cannot see My face, | Berakhot 7a:30 | The Gemara continues to cite the Sages’ explanation of verses that require clarification on the same topic. With regard to God’s statement to Moses, <b>“And He said: ‘You cannot see My face,</b> for man shall not see Me and live’” (Exodus 33:20), <b>it was taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Moses <b>as follows: When I wanted</b> to show you My glory at the burning bush, <b>you did not want</b> to see it, as it is stated: “And Moses concealed his face, fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6). But <b>now that you want</b> to see My glory, as you said: “Show me Your glory,” <b>I do not want</b> to show it to you. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa interprets Moses’ initial refusal to look upon God’s glory negatively, as he rebuffed God’s desire to be close to him. |
| Exodus 33:20 | as it is stated: “For no man shall see Me and live” | Megillah 19b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Had there been left</b> open <b>a crack</b> so much as <b>the size of small sewing needle in the cave in which Moses and Elijah stood</b> when God’s glory was revealed to them, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock” (Exodus 33:22), and: “And he came there to a cave…and, behold, the Lord passed by” (I Kings 19:9–11), <b>they would not have been able to endure due to the</b> intense <b>light</b> that would have entered that crack, <b>as it is stated: “For no man shall see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20). |
| Exodus 33:20 | for man cannot see Me and live” | Yevamot 49b:7 | The Gemara expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said:</b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him.</b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said:</b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6). |
| Exodus 33:22 | the size of small sewing needle in the cave in which Moses and Elijah stood | Megillah 19b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Had there been left</b> open <b>a crack</b> so much as <b>the size of small sewing needle in the cave in which Moses and Elijah stood</b> when God’s glory was revealed to them, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock” (Exodus 33:22), and: “And he came there to a cave…and, behold, the Lord passed by” (I Kings 19:9–11), <b>they would not have been able to endure due to the</b> intense <b>light</b> that would have entered that crack, <b>as it is stated: “For no man shall see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20). |
| Exodus 33:23 | “And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back, | Berakhot 7a:33 | What did Moses see? It is said: <b>“And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back,</b> but My face you will not see” (Exodus 33:23). <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida,</b> the expression: “And you will see My back,” should be understood as follows: <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> Who, as mentioned above, wears phylacteries, <b>showed him the knot of the phylacteries</b> of His head, which is worn on the back of the head. |
| Exodus 33:23 | “And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back” | Menachot 35b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10), it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: This</b> is a reference to <b>the phylacteries of the head,</b> upon which the name of God is written, as they demonstrate to all that the name of God is called upon the Jewish people. With regard to the statement of God to Moses: <b>“And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back”</b> (Exodus 33:23), <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Moses the knot of</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of the head. |
| Exodus 34:1 | which [ asher ] you broke” | Menachot 99b:1 | <b>the</b> apparent <b>dereliction of</b> the study of <b>Torah is its foundation,</b> e.g., if one breaks off his studies in order to participate in a funeral or a wedding procession. This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the Lord said to Moses: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <b>which [<i>asher</i>] you broke”</b> (Exodus 34:1). The word “<i>asher</i>” is an allusion to the fact that that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Your strength is true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i>]</b> in <b>that you broke</b> the tablets, as the breaking of the first tablets led to the foundation of the Torah through the giving of the second tablets. |
| Exodus 34:1 | “Hew for you” | Nedarim 38a:11 | <b>Moses</b> was wealthy, <b>as it is written: “I have not taken one donkey from them”</b> (Numbers 16:15). The Gemara analyzes the statement of Moses. <b>If</b> he said that he did not take a donkey <b>without payment,</b> was his intent <b>to exclude</b> himself from the category of <b>one who takes</b> items that belong to others <b>without paying?</b> That is obvious, as one who does so is a thief. <b>Rather,</b> he said <b>that even with payment</b> he did not take a donkey. Apparently, he was wealthy and did not need to purchase anything. The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>Perhaps,</b> on the contrary, he did not purchase a donkey <b>because he was poor</b> and could not afford it. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived from the verse written with regard to the Tablets of the Covenant: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), which indicates that <b>their waste shall be yours.</b> |
| Exodus 34:1 | as it is stated: “Hew for you two tablets of stone like the first” | Nedarim 38a:3 | § <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Moses became wealthy only from the waste</b> remaining <b>from</b> hewing <b>the Tablets</b> of the Covenant, <b>as it is stated: “Hew for you two tablets of stone like the first”</b> (Exodus 34:1). “Hew for you” means that <b>their waste shall be yours.</b> As the tablets were crafted from valuable gems, their remnants were similarly valuable. |
| Exodus 34:1 | “Hew for you” | Nedarim 38a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The Torah was given</b> initially <b>only to Moses and his descendants, as it is stated: “Write for you”</b> (Exodus 34:27), and it is also stated: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), meaning: <b>Just as their waste is yours, so too their writing is yours.</b> However, <b>Moses treated</b> the Torah <b>with generosity and gave it to the Jewish people. And about him, the verse says: “He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed,</b> as he gives of his bread to the poor” (Proverbs 22:9). |
| Exodus 34:1 | “Hew for you” | Nedarim 38a:9 | Moses was <b>wealthy,</b> as it is written: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), from which it was derived: The <b>waste</b> of the Tablets of the Covenant <b>shall be yours,</b> and that waste consisted of precious stones. That Moses <b>was wise</b> is derived from the statement of <b>Rav and Shmuel, who both say: Fifty measures of understanding were created in the world, and all were given to Moses except one, as it is stated: “Yet you have deprived him of little, of God”</b> (Psalms 8:6). He lacked only complete knowledge of God. Moses was <b>humble, as it is written: “Now the man Moses was very humble”</b> (Numbers 12:3). |
| Exodus 34:1 | which you broke [ asher shibarta ]” | Shabbat 87a:5 | And <b>he broke the tablets</b> following the sin of the Golden Calf. <b>What</b> source <b>did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? Moses <b>said: With</b> regard to the <b>Paschal</b> lamb, <b>which is</b> only <b>one of six hundred and thirteen mitzvot, the Torah stated:</b> “And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance of the Paschal offering; <b>no alien shall eat of it”</b> (Exodus 12:43), referring not only to gentiles, but to apostate Jews as well. Regarding the tablets, which represented <b>the entire Torah, and Israel</b> at that moment were <b>apostates,</b> as they were worshipping the calf, <b>all the more so</b> are they not worthy of receiving the Torah. <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, agreed with his</b> reasoning? <b>As it is stated:</b> “The first tablets <b>which you broke [<i>asher shibarta</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:1), <b>and Reish Lakish said:</b> The word <i>asher</i> is an allusion to the phrase: <b>May your strength be true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i></b>] <b>due to the fact that you broke</b> the tablets. |
| Exodus 34:1 | that you broke [ asher shibbarta ]” | Yevamot 62a:4 | <b>And his perception agreed with the perception of the Omnipresent, as it is written:</b> “The first tablets <b>that you broke [<i>asher shibbarta</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:1), <b>and Reish Lakish said:</b> The word <i>asher</i> is an allusion to the fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: May your strength be true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i>] that you broke</b> the tablets. |
| Exodus 34:3 | Now since it is written: “Neither shall the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount” | Beitzah 5b:5 | <b>Now since it is written: “Neither shall the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount”</b> (Exodus 34:3), this indicates that the prohibition applies only when the Divine Presence is revealed on the mountain, and it is permitted immediately afterward. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long”?</b> Why is a special signal required? <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>any matter</b> established by <b>a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b> |
| Exodus 34:3 | person honors his place, as we found with regard to Mount Sinai, that as long as the Divine Presence rested upon it, the Torah said: “Neither let the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount” | Taanit 21b:4 | Upon hearing this impressive argument, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: Let the Master arise and come</b> to live <b>with us</b> as our community leader. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>not the place of a person</b> that <b>honors him; rather,</b> the <b>person honors his place, as we found with regard to Mount Sinai, that as long as the Divine Presence rested upon it, the Torah said: “Neither let the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount”</b> (Exodus 34:3). Once <b>the Divine Presence departed from</b> the mountain, <b>the Torah said: “When the <i>shofar</i> sounds long they shall come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). This indicates that the sanctity was not inherent to the place but was due to the Divine Presence resting there. |
| Exodus 34:4 | early in the morning, as it is written: “And Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, | Shabbat 86a:6 | The Gemara explains the source of this opinion: <b>He ascended</b> Mount Sinai <b>early in the morning, as it is written: “And Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai,</b> as the Lord had commanded him” (Exodus 34:4). And <b>he descended</b> the mountain <b>early in the morning, as it is written: “Go descend and you shall ascend together with Aaron”</b> (Exodus 19:24). The Torah <b>juxtaposes descent to ascent</b> to establish that <b>just as</b> Moses’ <b>ascent</b> was <b>early in the morning, so too,</b> his <b>descent</b> was <b>early in the morning.</b> Moses told the people to separate in the early morning so that there would be five complete periods of separation over the course of the three days. |
| Exodus 34:6 | Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, | Arakhin 8b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do Rav Yehuda and Rabba <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the dispute between <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> about how God applies His attribute of “abundant in kindness” (Exodus 34:6) when He judges a person whose merits and sins are equal. <b>As it was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He hides away</b> some sins and does not put them on the scale, thereby allowing the merits to outweigh the sins. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: He lifts</b> the side of the scale that holds the sins so that the merits outweigh the sins. |
| Exodus 34:6 | “Long-suffering [ erekh appayim ]” | Bava Kamma50b:1 | in the verse that recounts the thirteen attributes of mercy: <b>“Long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:6), using the plural form, <b>and it is not written</b> as <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> in the singular? In order to teach that He is <b>long-suffering for</b> both <b>the righteous and for the wicked</b> and does not punish them immediately for their transgressions. |
| Exodus 34:6 | long-suffering [ erekh appayim ], | Eruvin 22a:6 | In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed: The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, <b>long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>],</b> and abundant in love and truth” (Exodus 34:6)? Why does it say “<i>erekh appayim</i>,” using a plural form? <b>It should have</b> said <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> using the singular form. |
| Exodus 34:6 | “and abundant in kindness” | Rosh Hashanah17a:12 | § It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people will not have to pass through Gehenna. The Gemara asks: <b>How does He do</b> this? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He pushes down</b> on the side of the merits, tipping the scale in their favor, <b>as it is stated: “He will again have compassion upon us; He will push down our iniquities”</b> (Micah 7:19). <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: He bears,</b> i.e., raises, the side of the sins, <b>as it is stated: “He bears [<i>noseh</i>] sin and forgives transgression”</b> (Micah 7:18). |
| Exodus 34:6 | “and abundant in kindness” | Rosh Hashanah17a:2 | <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He Who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people should not have to pass through Gehenna. <b>And about them, David said: “I love the Lord, Who hears my voice</b> and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1). <b>And about them, David said the entire passage: “I was brought low [<i>daloti</i>] and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). Although they are poor [<i>dalim</i>] in mitzvot, God saves them. |
| Exodus 34:6 | “and abundant in kindness” | Rosh Hashanah17a:7 | <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above: It stated that <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> He Who is <b>“and abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6) <b>tilts</b> the scales <b>in favor of kindness,</b> so that middling people will not have to pass through Gehenna. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And I will bring the third part through the fire”</b> (Zechariah 13:9), implying that there is a third group, which is sent to Gehenna temporarily? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring to <b>the rebellious Jews</b> who have sinned <b>with their bodies.</b> |
| Exodus 34:6 | “And abundant in kindness” | Rosh Hashanah17b:4 | <b>Ilfai, and some say</b> it was the Sage <b>Ilfa,</b> also <b>raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the list of God’s attributes: <b>“And abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6), <b>and it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And truth,”</b> which implies the attribute of justice. He answered: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment: <b>“And truth,”</b> i.e., God employs strict justice, <b>but in the end,</b> when He sees that the world cannot survive on judgment based only on truth and justice: <b>“And abundant in kindness,”</b> i.e., He is merciful. |
| Exodus 34:6 | “And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed” | Rosh Hashanah17b:5 | § The verse states: <b>“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed”</b> (Exodus 34:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wrapped Himself</b> in a prayer shawl <b>like a prayer leader and showed Moses</b> the structure of the <b>order of</b> the <b>prayer. He said to him: Whenever the Jewish people sin, let them act before Me in accordance with this order.</b> Let the prayer leader wrap himself in a prayer shawl and publicly recite the thirteen attributes of mercy, <b>and I will forgive them.</b> |
| Exodus 34:6 | “God, merciful and gracious” | Rosh Hashanah17b:6 | The verse continues: <b>“The Lord, the Lord,”</b> and it should be understood as follows: <b>I am He before a person sins, and I am He after a person sins and performs repentance,</b> as God does not recall for him his first sins, since He is always <b>“God, merciful and gracious”</b> (Exodus 34:6). |
| Exodus 34:7 | Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children, | Berakhot 7a:26 | The Gemara expands upon these righteous and wicked individuals: <b>The Master said: The righteous</b> person <b>who prospers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person. <b>The righteous</b> person <b>who suffers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a wicked</b> person. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it so</b> that one is always punished for his ancestors’ transgressions? <b>Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and fourth generations” (Exodus 34:7). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: “Fathers shall not die for their children, <b>and children shall not be put to death for the fathers;</b> every man shall die for his own transgression” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between the two verses.</b> |
| Exodus 34:7 | Moses said: “He visits the transgression of the fathers upon the sons” | Makkot 24a:30 | <b>Moses said: “He visits the transgression of the fathers upon the sons”</b> (Exodus 34:7). <b>Ezekiel came and revoked it: “The soul that sins, it shall die”</b> (Ezekiel 18:4), and not the children of that soul. |
| Exodus 34:7 | for the sin of the fathers? But isn’t it written: “Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, | Sanhedrin 27b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are children not</b> put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers? But isn’t it written: “Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation” (Exodus 34:7)? |
| Exodus 34:7 | But isn’t it written: “And Who will by no means clear the guilty [ venakkeh lo yenakkeh ]” | Shevuot 39a:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is it not stated with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah</b> that God <b>“will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> one who transgresses? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Who will by no means clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7)? |
| Exodus 34:7 | transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [ venakkeh ]” | Shevuot 39a:2 | <b>And</b> be aware that <b>with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7); <b>whereas here,</b> with regard to taking a false oath, <b>it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>].” And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The verse indicates that one who sins with his mouth, by taking a false oath, causes his flesh to be punished as well; <b>and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). |
| Exodus 34:7 | Moses it says: “Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin” | Yoma 36b:5 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How does he confess?</b> What is the formula of the confession? It is: <b>I have done wrong, I have rebelled, and I have sinned. And likewise, with regard to the scapegoat, it says</b> that the confession is in that order: <b>“And he shall confess over it all of the children of Israel’s wrongdoings and all their rebellions and all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21). <b>And likewise,</b> when God revealed Himself to <b>Moses it says: “Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin”</b> (Exodus 34:7). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say</b> that the meaning of these terms is: <b>Wrongdoings are intentional</b> transgressions, <b>and likewise it says: “That soul shall be cut off, it bears its guilt”</b> (Numbers 15:31). This refers to sins committed intentionally. |
| Exodus 34:7 | Rabbi Elazar says: It is not possible to say “absolve” | Yoma 86a:5 | § Since the Gemara cited this <i>baraita</i>, it now clarifies part of it. <b>The Master said: Since it was stated at Horeb</b> with regard to repentance: <b>“Absolve.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this concept that repentance was mentioned there? The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: It is not possible to say “absolve”</b> (Exodus 34:7) about all transgressions, since <b>“will not absolve” is already stated</b> (Exodus 34:7). <b>And it is not possible to say “will not absolve,”</b> since <b>“absolve” is already stated. How so?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>absolves those who repent and does not absolve those who do not repent.</b> Therefore, both “repentance” and “absolve” were mentioned at Horeb. |
| Exodus 34:10 | “Behold, I make a covenant” | Rosh Hashanah17b:7 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: A covenant was made with the thirteen attributes that they will not return empty-handed,</b> meaning that if one mentions them, he will certainly be answered, <b>as it is stated</b> in this regard: <b>“Behold, I make a covenant”</b> (Exodus 34:10). |
| Exodus 34:14 | “You shall bow down to no other god” | Chullin 62b:9 | <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The bird known as the <b>reclining and eating <i>mardu</i> is permitted,</b> while the <b>bowing and eating</b> <i>mardu</i> <b>is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the verse: <b>“You shall bow down to no other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine drinker is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Those who drank wine are unfit for service</b> in the Temple. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine pourer is forbidden.</b> |
| Exodus 34:14 | it is written in the Torah: “You shall not bow down to any other god” | Gittin 57b:16 | <b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “You shall not bow down to any other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). And so <b>they took him out and killed him. They</b> then <b>brought</b> in yet <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4). And so <b>they took him out and killed him.</b> |
| Exodus 34:14 | as it is written: “You shall not bow to another god” | Horayot 4a:20 | The Gemara cites proof against the statement of Rav Yehuda, citing Shmuel. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: The judges are liable if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against engaging in <b>idol worship</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who bows</b> to the idol but did not sacrifice an offering is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> should they be liable in that case? With regard to <b>one who bows</b> to an idol, <b>isn’t it written</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written: “You shall not bow to another god”</b> (Exodus 34:14)? |
| Exodus 34:14 | the verse states: “For you shall bow to no other god” | Sanhedrin 60b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>We have heard</b> the <b>punishment</b> for bowing down to an idol, but <b>from where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against doing so derived? The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “For you shall bow to no other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). |
| Exodus 34:15 | and they call you, and you eat of their sacrifice” | Avodah Zarah8a:17 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Jews who are outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>are</b> considered to <b>engage in idol worship in purity,</b> i.e., unwittingly. <b>How</b> does this occur? In the case of <b>a gentile who prepared a feast for</b> the marriage of <b>his son, and invited all of the Jews in his town, even though they eat of their own</b> kosher food <b>and drink of their own</b> kosher beverages, <b>and their own attendant stands before them, the verse ascribes</b> guilt <b>to them as though they ate of</b> the <b>offerings to the dead,</b> i.e., idols, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And sacrifice to their gods, <b>and they call you, and you eat of their sacrifice”</b> (Exodus 34:15). Since Jews participate in a feast in which the gentile sacrifices offerings to his idol, it is as though they partook of the offering themselves. |
| Exodus 34:17 | worshipping idols, as it is written: “Molten gods you shall not make for yourself” | Makkot 23a:4 | <b>And Rav Sheshet says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who treats the Festivals with contempt, it is as though</b> he is <b>worshipping idols, as it is written: “Molten gods you shall not make for yourself”</b> (Exodus 34:17), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“The festival of Passover you shall observe”</b> (Exodus 34:18). |
| Exodus 34:17 | as it is stated: “You shall make yourself no molten gods” | Pesachim 118a:12 | After citing a statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that was transmitted by <i>amora’im</i>, the Gemara quotes additional expositions attributed to him. <b>And Rav Sheshet said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who disparages the Festivals, it is</b> considered <b>as though he engages in idol worship.</b> This, too, is derived from the juxtaposition of verses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall make yourself no molten gods”</b> (Exodus 34:17), <b>and afterward it is written: “The Festival of <i>matzot</i> you shall keep”</b> (Exodus 34:18), from which it can be inferred that anyone who does not observe the Festivals properly is likened to one who fashions idols. |
| Exodus 34:18 | “The festival of Passover you shall observe” | Makkot 23a:4 | <b>And Rav Sheshet says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who treats the Festivals with contempt, it is as though</b> he is <b>worshipping idols, as it is written: “Molten gods you shall not make for yourself”</b> (Exodus 34:17), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“The festival of Passover you shall observe”</b> (Exodus 34:18). |
| Exodus 34:18 | and afterward it is written: “The Festival of matzot you shall keep” | Pesachim 118a:12 | After citing a statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that was transmitted by <i>amora’im</i>, the Gemara quotes additional expositions attributed to him. <b>And Rav Sheshet said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who disparages the Festivals, it is</b> considered <b>as though he engages in idol worship.</b> This, too, is derived from the juxtaposition of verses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall make yourself no molten gods”</b> (Exodus 34:17), <b>and afterward it is written: “The Festival of <i>matzot</i> you shall keep”</b> (Exodus 34:18), from which it can be inferred that anyone who does not observe the Festivals properly is likened to one who fashions idols. |
| Exodus 34:19 | “From all your livestock you shall take the males” | Bekhorot 3a:16 | <b>Rav Pappa said to them: What is different</b> about the case of the fetus, where owning a portion of its ear exempts the Jew from the obligations of firstborn status? It is <b>because we require</b> the fulfillment of the verse <b>“all the firstborn,”</b> i.e., that all of it be owned by the Jew, <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case. If so, with regard to <b>its mother as well we require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: <b>“From all your livestock you shall take the males”</b> (Exodus 34:19), which also indicates that all the livestock, including the mother, must belong to the Jew, <b>and</b> this <b>is not</b> the case. <b>Rather,</b> there <b>is no difference,</b> and they disagree both in the case of the fetus and in that of the mother. |
| Exodus 34:20 | “You shall redeem” | Bekhorot 12a:3 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the Paschal offering, then perhaps <b>just as there,</b> the Paschal offering must be a lamb that is <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year</b> (Exodus 12:5), <b>so too here,</b> the lamb must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 13:13), and: <b>“You shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20). This repetition serves to <b>include</b> female lambs, blemished lambs, and lambs that are beyond their first year. |
| Exodus 34:20 | “And all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty” | Bekhorot 51b:11 | <b>Rav Dimi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> says: It is written with regard to the redemption of the firstborn: <b>“And all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty”</b> (Exodus 34:20), and it likewise states with regard to the burnt offering of appearance: “And none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 23:15). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the burnt offering of appearance, if one died after becoming obligated to bring the offering <b>the heirs are obligated</b> to bring his offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, if the obligation already took effect, and the son and the father then died, <b>the heirs are obligated</b> to give five <i>sela</i> coins to a priest. |
| Exodus 34:20 | “And every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty” | Bekhorot 51b:8 | <b>Rav Dimi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> says: The verse states concerning the redemption of the firstborn: <b>“And every firstborn of your sons you shall redeem, and none shall appear before Me empty”</b> (Exodus 34:20). <b>And</b> therefore this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between <b>“empty”</b> and <b>“empty,” from</b> the passage discussing <b>the burnt offering of appearance,</b> which every pilgrim must bring on a Festival. With regard to the burnt offering of appearance it states: “And none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 23:15). <b>Just as</b> in the case of the <b>burnt offering of appearance one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for the loss of the offering, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>redemption of the firstborn one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for its loss as well. |
| Exodus 34:20 | firstborn of a donkey | Bekhorot 5b:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A cow that gave birth to a donkey of sorts and a donkey that gave birth to a horse of sorts are exempt from</b> their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn, as it is stated:</b> “And every <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13); “and the <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 34:20). The Torah states this <i>halakha</i> <b>twice,</b> indicating that one is not obligated <b>unless</b> both <b>the birth mother is a donkey and the</b> animal <b>born is a donkey.</b> |
| Exodus 34:20 | “firstborn of a donkey” | Bekhorot 6a:1 | Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the phrase: <b>“Firstborn of a donkey”</b> (Exodus 13:13), <b>“firstborn of a donkey”</b> (Exodus 34:20), mentioning it a total of <b>two times.</b> The additional usage of the term indicates <b>I said to you</b> that firstborn status applies only to <b>firstborns of donkeys, but not</b> to <b>firstborns of horses or camels.</b> |
| Exodus 34:20 | as it is stated: “And you shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb [ seh ]” | Bekhorot 9a:6 | From where is it derived that the firstborn of a donkey is redeemed with a lamb? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb [<i>seh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:20). The owner may give a lamb either <b>from sheep or from goats;</b> from <b>males or females,</b> from <b>older or younger</b> animals, and from <b>unblemished or blemished</b> animals. If the priest returns the lamb to the owner, he <b>may redeem</b> firstborn donkeys <b>with it many times.</b> In a case where he designates a lamb due to uncertainty and keeps it for himself, it is his in every sense. Consequently, <b>it enters the pen in order to be tithed</b> with the other non-sacred animals (see Leviticus 27:32), <b>and if it dies, one may derive benefit from its</b> carcass. |
| Exodus 34:20 | with regard to a firstborn: | Kiddushin 17a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He derives</b> a verbal analogy from <b>“empty”</b> stated with regard to the severance gift: “You shall not send him away empty” (Deuteronomy 15:13), and <b>“empty”</b> stated <b>with regard to a firstborn:</b> “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem; and none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 34:20). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the firstborn, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>, so too here,</b> in the case of severance gifts, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 34:20 | as it is written: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem” | Kiddushin 29a:15 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to redeem</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20). <b>And</b> in a case <b>where</b> one’s <b>father does not redeem him he is obligated to redeem</b> himself, <b>as it is written: “You shall redeem [<i>pado tifde</i>]”</b> (Numbers 18:15). The repetition of the verb indicates that a firstborn is required to be redeemed in any case, even if his father neglects to do so. |
| Exodus 34:20 | As the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem” | Kiddushin 29a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that she is not obligated to redeem herself?</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “You shall redeem [<i>tifde</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>You shall be redeemed [<i>tippadeh</i>].</b> This indicates that <b>any</b> person <b>whom others are commanded to redeem is commanded to redeem himself, and any</b> person <b>whom others are not commanded to redeem is not commanded to redeem himself.</b> Since there is no mitzva for a parent to redeem his daughter, there is similarly no mitzva for a daughter to redeem herself. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that others are not commanded to redeem</b> a daughter? <b>As the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), i.e., <b>your sons and not your daughters.</b> |
| Exodus 34:20 | that the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem” | Kiddushin 29b:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>as he stated</b> in <b>his reasoning,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda provided the rationale for his opinion. <b>But what is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who say that he should first redeem his son? The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), <b>and</b> it <b>then</b> states, in the same verse: <b>“And none shall appear before me empty,”</b> referring to the pilgrimage Festival in Jerusalem. The order of the verse indicates that one should redeem his firstborn son before traveling to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage Festival. |
| Exodus 34:20 | women, he is obligated to redeem them all? The verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem” | Kiddushin 29b:6 | <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one had five</b> firstborn <b>sons, from five</b> different <b>women, he is obligated to redeem them all? The verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), and the emphasis of “all” includes any of one’s firstborn sons. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> this is the case? After all, <b>the Merciful One made</b> this mitzva <b>dependent upon the opening of the womb,</b> as it states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, whoever opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2). Since each of these sons is the firstborn of his mother, it is clear that the father is required to redeem each of them. |
| Exodus 34:21 | “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest” | Horayot 4b:8 | Apropos rulings to nullify a mitzva or part of a mitzva, <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If a court issued a ruling that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat during the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Before seeking to resolve that dilemma, the Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>did they err</b> that resulted in that ruling? They erred <b>with regard to this verse</b> written with regard to Shabbat: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21), which the judges interpreted to mean: <b>During a time when there is plowing,</b> i.e., in all years of the Sabbatical cycle other than the Sabbatical Year, <b>there is</b> a prohibition against performing labor on <b>Shabbat. But during a time when there is no plowing,</b> i.e., during the Sabbatical Year, <b>there is no</b> prohibition against performing labor on <b>Shabbat.</b> |
| Exodus 34:21 | “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest” | Makkot 8b:3 | <b>Some teach</b> this exchange <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This verse is referring to the Sabbatical Year. The Torah <b>does not need to state</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing</b> during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>or harvesting</b> during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>as it is already stated: “You shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). What, then, is derived from this verse? <b>Rather,</b> it is derived that <b>even plowing</b> on the <b>eve of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>which</b> facilitates growth of crops when the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>enters, and</b> the <b>harvest of</b> crops that grew during the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>which emerged</b> and were reaped after the <b>conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, are prohibited. |
| Exodus 34:21 | Rabbi Yishmael says: | Menachot 72a:12 | <b>And</b> furthermore, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that the <b>reaping of</b> barley for <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>is a mitzva. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse: “In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest” (Exodus 34:21), is not referring to the prohibition against farming the land during the Sabbatical Year, as one might have thought. Rather, it is referring to the prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat. And the reason that the verse mentions these two particular forms of labor is to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>plowing</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat is an otherwise <b>voluntary</b> act, as plowing is never required by the Torah, <b>so too,</b> the <b>harvesting</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat <b>is voluntary.</b> Therefore, <b>the harvesting of the <i>omer</i> is excluded</b> from the prohibition, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> Consequently, the barley for the <i>omer</i> is harvested on the sixteenth of Nisan, even if it occurs on Shabbat. |
| Exodus 34:21 | “In plowing and in reaping you shall rest” | Moed Katan3b:13 | The Gemara raises another question: <b>Are these</b> prohibitions of plowing before the Sabbatical Year really <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> actually prohibitions based on explicit <b>verses. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“In plowing and in reaping you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21) that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary</b> for the verse <b>to speak</b> about <b>plowing and reaping during the Sabbatical Year, as it was already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath for the Lord; <b>your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). This teaches that during the seventh year all agricultural labor is prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes to prohibit <b>plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year</b> |
| Exodus 34:21 | “In plowing and in reaping you shall rest” | Moed Katan3b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This addition is referring to <b>the</b> extra <b>days that the Sages added</b> to the prohibition against performing agricultural labor, <b>before Rosh HaShana</b> of the seventh year, when the Sabbatical Year formally begins. <b>And this is what it is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be flogged for</b> working the land during <b>the additional</b> period prior to <b>Rosh HaShana</b> of the Sabbatical Year, <b>as</b> this prohibition <b>is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“In plowing and in reaping you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). This seemingly superfluous verse is understood as teaching that not only is working the land prohibited during the seventh year, but plowing a field during the sixth year to prepare the land for the seventh year, and reaping what grew in the seventh year during the eighth year are also prohibited. <b>But a teaching states an exemption</b> from lashes for these actions, <b>as we are about to state below.</b> |
| Exodus 34:21 | “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest” | Rosh Hashanah9a:3 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“In plowing and in harvest you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is unnecessary to state</b> this <b>about plowing and harvesting during the Sabbatical Year, as it is already stated:</b> “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land, a Shabbat for the Lord; <b>you shall neither sow your field,</b> nor prune your vineyard” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Rather,</b> the verse: “In plowing and in harvest you shall rest,” is referring to <b>plowing in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year going into the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., plowing in the sixth year that will benefit the crops growing in the Sabbatical Year, <b>and</b> about <b>harvesting of the Sabbatical Year going into the year that follows the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., harvesting grain that grew in the Sabbatical Year in the eighth year. This teaches that there is a requirement to add extra time to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year, and not work the land both before and after. |
| Exodus 34:21 | in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest” | Shabbat 70a:4 | <b>I might have thought</b> that if <b>one performed them all in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> forgetting that they are prohibited, he would be <b>liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin-offering? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Six days you shall work, and on the seventh you shall rest; <b>in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21), indicating that there are prohibitions specific to both plowing and harvesting. <b>And still I</b> can <b>say: For plowing and for the harvesting he is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings, as they were stated explicitly. <b>However, for</b> performing <b>all</b> the other prohibited labors, <b>he is liable for only one.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not kindle fire</b> in all your dwellings on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). This is derived in the following manner: <b>Kindling was</b> included <b>in the general</b> prohibition prohibiting all labors, <b>and why was it</b> singled <b>out</b> and prohibited explicitly? It was singled out in order <b>to equate</b> the other labors <b>to it and to tell you: Just as kindling is a primary category of prohibited labor, and one is liable for</b> performing <b>it on its own, so too,</b> with regard to <b>every primary category of prohibited labor, one is liable for</b> performing <b>it on its own.</b> |
| Exodus 34:22 | The verse states: “And you shall make for yourself a festival of Shavuot , the first fruits of the wheat harvest” | Menachot 84b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the two loaves <b>precede</b> the bringing of the <b>first fruits</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “And you shall make for yourself a festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, the first fruits of the wheat harvest”</b> (Exodus 34:22). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes the bringing of the first fruits of the wheat harvest. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the two loaves precede the <b>first fruits of the wheat harvest. From where</b> do I derive that they also precede the bringing of the first fruits of <b>the barley harvest? The verse states</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>“And the festival of the harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you will sow in the field”</b> (Exodus 23:16). The order of the verse teaches that the offering of the Festival, which is the two loaves offering, precedes all forms of first fruits that are sown in the field, which includes barley. |
| Exodus 34:22 | the Festival of the Ingathering at the turn of the year” | Sanhedrin 13a:1 | <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The year must be intercalated only if <b>twenty-one days</b> of Tishrei will pass before the autumnal equinox. The Gemara explains: <b>And both of them expounded the same verse</b> to arrive at their respective opinions: “And <b>the Festival of the Ingathering at the turn of the year”</b> (Exodus 34:22). They both interpret the verse to mean that the Festival of the Ingathering, which is referring to the intermediate days of <i>Sukkot</i>, must take place during the season of Tishrei, i.e., autumn. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require all of the Festival</b> to take place <b>in the new season,</b> after the equinox. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>some of the Festival,</b> even one day, to take place <b>in the new season,</b> so the year must be intercalated only if the equinox would fall on the twenty-second of Tishrei or later. |
| Exodus 34:24 | which the Torah said: “And no man shall covet your land, | Pesachim 8b:7 | The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says: With regard to</b> that <b>which the Torah said: “And no man shall covet your land,</b> when you go up to appear before God your Lord three times in the year” (Exodus 34:24), this <b>teaches that your cow shall graze in the meadow and no beast will harm it,</b> and <b>your rooster shall peck in the garbage</b> dump <b>and no marten</b> [<b><i>ḥulda</i></b>] <b>shall harm it.</b> In other words, your property will be protected while everyone ascends to Jerusalem for the Festival, despite the fact that the farm will not be defended. |
| Exodus 34:25 | transgresses a prohibition, | Menachot 78b:6 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 63a) with regard to the slaughtering of the Paschal offering: <b>One who slaughters the Paschal offering with leavened bread</b> still in his possession <b>transgresses a prohibition,</b> as the verse states: “You shall not sacrifice the blood of My offering with [<i>al</i>] leavened bread; neither shall the offering of the festival of Passover be left until the morning” (Exodus 34:25). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> one who slaughters <b>the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> on Passover eve with leavened bread in his possession transgresses the prohibition. <b>And Reish Lakish says: Actually, one is not liable unless</b> the leavened bread <b>is</b> in the possession <b>of the one who slaughters</b> the offering, <b>or the one who sprinkles</b> its blood, <b>or one of the members of the group,</b> and the leavened bread is <b>with</b> that person <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One is liable <b>even if</b> the leavened bread <b>is not with</b> that person <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Evidently, they already disagree with regard to the meaning of the word “<i>al.</i>” |
| Exodus 34:25 | it is written: “Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of Passover be left over until morning” | Pesachim 59b:8 | Similarly, <b>Rav Safra raised a contradiction before Rav:</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of Passover be left over until morning”</b> (Exodus 34:25), from which it can be inferred that <b>it may not remain overnight</b> and <b>into the morning</b> hours, <b>but it may remain all through the night.</b> Accordingly, the fats of a Paschal lamb that was slaughtered on a weekday Passover eve may be offered on the altar on the night of the Festival. <b>However,</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “The burnt-offering of each Shabbat on its own Shabbat</b> in addition to the continual burnt-offering and its libation” (Numbers 28:10), from which it is derived that <b>the burnt-offering of a weekday is not offered on Shabbat, and the burnt-offering of a weekday is not offered on a Festival.</b> Therefore, it should be prohibited to burn the fats of the Paschal lamb on the altar on the Festival, as it is a weekday offering and consequently may not be offered on a Festival. |
| Exodus 34:25 | from here: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My offering over leavened bread; | Pesachim 5a:16 | <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that leaven is prohibited from midday on the fourteenth of Nisan is derived <b>from here: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My offering over leavened bread;</b> neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning” (Exodus 34:25). This verse means that <b>you shall not slaughter the Paschal lamb while</b> your <b>leavened bread is still intact.</b> In other words, all leaven must be removed before the time the Paschal lamb may be slaughtered. |
| Exodus 34:25 | only to the Festival itself. The verse states: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My offering over leavened bread” | Pesachim 5a:18 | The Gemara adds that some of the aforementioned opinions <b>were also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15). This prohibition is in effect <b>from the eve of the Festival. Or perhaps</b> that is <b>not</b> the case, but <b>it</b> applies <b>only to the Festival itself. The verse states: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My offering over leavened bread”</b> (Exodus 34:25), meaning that <b>you shall not slaughter the Paschal lamb while</b> your <b>leavened bread is still intact.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> |
| Exodus 34:25 | violates a negative commandment, | Pesachim 63a:7 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who slaughters the Paschal lamb with leavened bread</b> still in his possession <b>violates a negative commandment,</b> as the Torah states: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the festival of Passover be left until the morning” (Exodus 34:25). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> one who slaughters <b>the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> on Passover eve with leaven in his possession violates the commandment. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One who slaughters <b>the Paschal lamb on the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>for its</b> own <b>purpose</b> with leaven in his possession <b>is liable;</b> but if he slaughtered it <b>for a different purpose he is exempt. And</b> for <b>all other offerings</b> that one slaughters on Passover eve, when owning leaven is prohibited, <b>whether</b> he slaughtered them <b>for their</b> own <b>purpose or</b> he slaughtered them <b>for a different purpose, he is exempt.</b> |
| Exodus 34:25 | It is written: “You shall not offer with leavened bread” | Pesachim 63b:10 | <b>Rav Oshaya asked Rabbi Ami</b> the following question: If <b>the slaughterer does not have</b> leaven in his possession <b>but one of the members of the group does have, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: Is it written: You shall not offer</b> the blood of My sacrifice <b>with your leavened bread,</b> meaning you may not slaughter the Paschal lamb with the leaven of the slaughterer? <b>It is written: “You shall not offer with leavened bread”</b> (Exodus 34:25), meaning you may not slaughter it with anyone’s leaven and not necessarily leaven that belongs to the slaughterer. |
| Exodus 34:25 | said to you | Pesachim 64a:5 | It was stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One is liable <b>even for</b> slaughtering <b>the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> on the eve of Passover with leaven in his possession. <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the verse states: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread” (Exodus 34:25). <b>“My sacrifice”</b> indicates <b>the sacrifice that is designated to Me; and what is it?</b> This is referring to <b>the daily offering,</b> which is a burnt-offering brought each day as part of the Temple service. |
| Exodus 34:25 | “Neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning” | Pesachim 70a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> and scriptural basis <b>for ben Teima’s</b> opinion? The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav taught his son Ḥiyya</b> based on the following verse: <b>“Neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning”</b> (Exodus 34:25). <b>“The offering of the feast,” this</b> is referring to <b>the Festival peace-offering; “the Passover,” as per its plain meaning,</b> i.e., this is referring to the Paschal lamb itself. <b>And</b> with regard to both sacrifices, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“It shall not be left</b> to the morning.” This proves that the Festival peace-offering may be eaten for only a day and a night. |
| Exodus 34:25 | “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread” | Pesachim 95b:1 | <b>what is it including,</b> beyond what is mentioned explicitly in the verse? The Gemara answers that it includes the mitzva: <b>“Do not eat from it raw”</b> (Exodus 12:9). The Gemara asks: <b>What does it exclude through its detail?</b> The Gemara answers that it excludes the mitzva: <b>“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread”</b> (Exodus 34:25). The Gemara asks: Perhaps <b>I</b> can <b>reverse it</b> and say the opposite, that the prohibition against eating the offering raw is excluded, and the prohibition against owning leaven is included. The Gemara answers: Including <b>a mitzva related to</b> the Paschal lamb <b>itself is preferable</b> to including one that does not relate as directly to the Paschal lamb. Therefore, the prohibition against eating the Paschal lamb raw is included, and the prohibition against slaughtering the Paschal lamb with leaven in one’s possession is excluded. |
| Exodus 34:27 | “For on the basis of [ al pi ] these matters | Gittin 60b:2 | § The Gemara continues its discussion concerning the writing of the Torah: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The majority of the Torah</b> was transmitted <b>in writing, while the minority</b> was transmitted <b>orally, as it is stated: “I wrote for him the greater part of My Torah; they were reckoned a strange thing”</b> (Hosea 8:12), meaning that the majority of the Torah was transmitted in written form. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The majority</b> of the Torah was transmitted <b>orally [<i>al peh</i>], while the minority</b> was transmitted <b>in writing, as it is stated</b> with regard to the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai: <b>“For on the basis of [<i>al pi</i>] these matters</b> I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” (Exodus 34:27), which indicates that the greater part of the Sinaitic covenant was taught orally. |
| Exodus 34:27 | It is written: “Write you these matters” | Gittin 60b:5 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Naḥmani, the disseminator for Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, expounded</b> as follows: <b>It is written: “Write you these matters”</b> (Exodus 34:27), <b>and it is written</b> later in that same verse: <b>“For on the basis of [<i>al pi</i>] these matters.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? They mean to teach: <b>Matters that were written you may not express them orally [<i>al peh</i>],</b> and <b>matters that were</b> taught <b>orally you may not express them in writing. The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The word <b>“these”</b> in the mitzva recorded in the verse “Write you these matters” is used here in an emphatic sense: <b>These</b> matters, i.e., those recorded in the Written Law, <b>you may write, but you may not write <i>halakhot</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>mishnayot</i> and the rest of the Oral Law. |
| Exodus 34:27 | orally [ be’al peh ], as it is stated: “For on the basis of [ al pi ] these matters I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” | Gittin 60b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, made a covenant with the Jewish people only for the sake of the matters that</b> were transmitted <b>orally [<i>be’al peh</i>], as it is stated: “For on the basis of [<i>al pi</i>] these matters I have made a covenant with you and with Israel”</b> (Exodus 34:27). |
| Exodus 34:27 | “For according to these words | Nedarim 32a:6 | <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that it is equal to all the mitzvot of the Torah, as it is stated</b> at the giving of the Torah: <b>“For according to these words</b> I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” (Exodus 34:27), and “covenant” refers to circumcision. <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that if not for circumcision heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night,</b> I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body. |
| Exodus 34:27 | only to Moses and his descendants, as it is stated: “Write for you” | Nedarim 38a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The Torah was given</b> initially <b>only to Moses and his descendants, as it is stated: “Write for you”</b> (Exodus 34:27), and it is also stated: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), meaning: <b>Just as their waste is yours, so too their writing is yours.</b> However, <b>Moses treated</b> the Torah <b>with generosity and gave it to the Jewish people. And about him, the verse says: “He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed,</b> as he gives of his bread to the poor” (Proverbs 22:9). |
| Exodus 34:27 | “For by the mouth of these words” | Temurah 14b:3 | Before resolving the difficulty, the Gemara further discusses the prohibition of writing down the Torah: <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Naḥmani, the disseminator for Reish Lakish, expounded</b> as follows: <b>One verse says: “Write you these words,” and one verse says,</b> i.e., it states later in that same verse: <b>“For by the mouth of these words”</b> (Exodus 34:27). These phrases serve <b>to say to you: Words that were</b> taught <b>orally you may not recite in writing, and</b> words <b>that are written you may not recite orally,</b> i.e., by heart. |
| Exodus 34:28 | and it is written there: “And he was there with the Lord | Sotah 13b:25 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says:</b> Over an area of <b>twelve <i>mil</i> by twelve <i>mil</i>, equivalent to the</b> size of the <b>camp of Israel, a Divine Voice proclaimed and said: And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died. And some say: Moses did not</b> actually <b>die,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And</b> Moses, the servant of the Lord, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written there: “And he was there with the Lord</b> forty days and forty nights” (Exodus 34:28). <b>Just as there,</b> where it says: “And he was there with the Lord,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God; <b>so too, here,</b> when it says: “And Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God. |
| Exodus 34:29 | As it is stated: “And Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant” | Beitzah 16a:6 | § Apropos the statements about honoring Shabbat, the Gemara cites another statement on the same topic. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: One who gives a gift to his friend need not inform him</b> that he has given it to him, and he need not concern himself that the recipient might not realize who gave it to him. <b>As it is stated: “And Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant”</b> (Exodus 34:29); Moses received this gift unawares. |
| Exodus 34:29 | “And Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone when He spoke with him” | Shabbat 10b:5 | With regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ḥama bar Ḥanina say: One who gives a gift to his friend need not inform him,</b> as God made Moses’ face glow, and nevertheless <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Moses: <b>“And Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone when He spoke with him”</b> (Exodus 34:29)? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. When</b> Rav Ḥama bar Ḥanina said that he need not inform him, he was referring to <b>a matter that is likely to be revealed. When</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said that he needs to inform him, he was referring to <b>a matter that is not likely to be revealed.</b> The Gemara asked: If so, <b>isn’t Shabbat likely to be revealed,</b> as it will be necessary to inform them of Shabbat together with the other mitzvot? Why was Moses asked to inform them about Shabbat separately? The Gemara answers: <b>The giving of its reward is not likely to be revealed,</b> and it was necessary to inform them about so extraordinary a gift. |
| Exodus 34:30 | he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him” | Berakhot 7a:32 | Because “Moses <b>concealed his face,</b> fearing to gaze upon God” (Exodus 3:6), <b>he was privileged to</b> have his <b>countenance [<i>kelaster</i>]</b> glow. <br>Because <b>he “feared,” he was privileged that “they feared to approach him”</b> (Exodus 34:30). <br>Because he did not <b>“gaze,” he was privileged to “behold the likeness of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 12:8). |
| Exodus 35:1 | says | Shabbat 97b:2 | <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that Shabbat is mentioned in the verse: “These are the things [<i>eleh hadevarim</i>] that God has commanded to perform them” (Exodus 35:1)? Several points are derived from the superfluous emphases in this verse. The Torah could simply have stated: This is a thing [<i>davar</i>]. When it states <b>things [<i>devarim</i>]</b> in the plural, it teaches at least two points. The addition of the definite article the in the term <b>the things [<i>hadevarim</i>]</b> adds at least a third point. The numerological value of letters of the word <i>eleh</i>, which are <i>alef</i>, one; <i>lamed</i>, thirty; and <i>heh</i>, five, is thirty-six. The phrase: <b>These are the things,</b> alludes to three plus thirty-six derivation, i.e., the <b>thirty-nine prohibited labors that were stated to Moses at Sinai.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that there are a fixed number of primary categories of labor, he would certainly hold a person liable for the primary categories but not for the subcategories. |
| Exodus 35:2 | shall die” | Shabbat 70a:2 | We learned in the mishna that <b>one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each prohibited labor</b> that he performs on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>the division of labors?</b> What is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that if one performs numerous prohibited labors on Shabbat in the course of one lapse of awareness, each prohibited labor is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment? <b>Shmuel said</b> that <b>the verse says:</b> “And you shall observe the Shabbat, for it is holy to you; <b>he who desecrates it shall surely die [<i>mot yumat</i>]”</b> (Exodus 31:14). We learn from the double language, <i>mot yumat</i>, that <b>the Torah amplified multiple deaths for a single desecration.</b> Although several violations were committed in the course of a single lapse of awareness, each is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment. The Gemara asks: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to intentional</b> transgression. The Gemara is seeking a source for multiple sacrifices brought for unwitting transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>If it does not</b> refer to <b>the matter</b> of <b>intentional</b> transgression, as the verse does not teach a <i>halakha</i> applicable to intentional acts, <b>as it was</b> already <b>written:</b> “Six days you shall perform work, and on the seventh day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God; <b>all who desecrate</b> it <b>shall die”</b> (Exodus 35:2), <b>refer it to the matter of unwitting</b> transgression. The verse teaches that that which was written with regard to the death penalty for desecration of Shabbat in general applies to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, including cases of unwitting transgression. <b>And what,</b> then, is the meaning of the term: <b>Shall die,</b> in the verse? Does it mean that one who commits an unwitting transgression is punishable by death? It means that <b>he shall die by</b> payment of <b>money.</b> Death is used in the sense of punishment; he will be forced to pay for numerous sacrifices to atone for his sins. |
| Exodus 35:3 | to extinguish and to kindle. | Keritot 20b:1 | This is referring to a case <b>where he intended</b> both <b>to extinguish and to kindle.</b> The Torah singles out the labor of kindling on Shabbat, as it is written: “You shall not kindle fire in all your dwelling places on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). The Sages disagree with regard to the interpretation of this verse. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: Kindling was</b> singled <b>out</b> from the general category of prohibited labors in order to teach that it is unlike other labors, teaching <b>that</b> it is a regular <b>prohibition,</b> i.e., it is punishable only with lashes and does not entail <i>karet</i> or stoning for an intentional transgression, or a sin offering for an unwitting transgression. Consequently, he is not liable to bring a sin offering for the kindling. |
| Exodus 35:3 | the verse states: “You shall kindle no fire | Sanhedrin 35b:6 | <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>It has already been ruled by a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall kindle no fire</b> throughout your habitations on Shabbat day” (Exodus 35:3)? All labor is forbidden on Shabbat, based on the verse: “In it you shall not do any manner of work” (Exodus 20:10). Why is kindling fire singled out? |
| Exodus 35:3 | was singled out | Sanhedrin 62a:7 | <b>Rabbi Abba says: That which Rabbi Zakkai says</b> is subject to a tannaitic <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition against <b>kindling</b> a fire on Shabbat <b>was singled out</b> from the general category of labor prohibited on Shabbat, and it is written explicitly in the Torah in the verse: “You shall not kindle fire in all your dwelling places on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). This was done <b>to</b> teach that the prohibition against kindling a fire on Shabbat is unlike other prohibited labors, as it is an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> for which one is not liable to be killed by stoning. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> |
| Exodus 35:3 | “You shall kindle no fire in all of your habitations | Shabbat 20a:5 | We learned the following in the mishna: <b>And one may light the fire</b> in the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth in the Temple on Shabbat eve adjacent to nightfall and allow the fire to spread afterward throughout the entire bonfire. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> that doing so is permitted, <b>derived? Rav Huna said,</b> as it is stated: <b>“You shall kindle no fire in all of your habitations</b> on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). The Gemara infers: <b>“In all of your habitations,”</b> the dwelling places of the Jewish people, <b>you may not kindle fire, but you may kindle fire</b> on Shabbat <b>in the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth,</b> which is in the Temple. <b>Rav Ḥisda objects: If so,</b> if that is the source for the fact that kindling the fire is permitted on Shabbat eve at nightfall, it should <b>also</b> be permitted to kindle it <b>even on Shabbat</b> itself. Why kindle the fire while it is still day? <b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said,</b> it should be understood as follows: <b>When the verse came, it came to permit</b> burning the <b>limbs and fats</b> of the sacrifices on the altar, even on Shabbat. Lighting the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth was not permitted on Shabbat itself, since it is not part of the Temple service. It was kindled merely for the benefit of the priests. The fact that there was no concern about lighting the bonfire on Shabbat eve at nightfall is because the <b>priests are vigilant</b> with regard to mitzvot, and they will certainly not come to stoke the coals. |
| Exodus 35:3 | “You shall not kindle fire in all your dwellings on the day of Shabbat” | Shabbat 70a:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And let him derive division of labors from where</b> it <b>was derived according to Rabbi Natan, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> that it is written: <b>“You shall not kindle fire in all your dwellings on the day of Shabbat”</b> (Exodus 35:3). <b>Why does the verse state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The prohibition against kindling is included in the general prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat. Rather, it should be understood as follows. <b>Since it is</b> already <b>stated: “And Moses gathered the entire assembly of the children of Israel</b> and said to them: <b>These are the things [<i>eleh hadevarim</i>]</b> that God has commanded to perform them. <b>Six days you shall perform work,</b> and on the seventh day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God” (Exodus 35:1–2), and Rabbi Natan derives as follows: “These are the things,” which refers to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, there are emphases in this phrase that are superfluous in the context of the verse. The Torah could have simply stated: This is a thing [<i>davar</i>]. When it states: <b>Things [<i>devarim</i>]</b> in the plural, it teaches at least two points. The addition of the definite article: <b>The things [<i>hadevarim</i>],</b> adds at least a third point. The numerological value of letters of the word <i>eleh</i>: <i>Alef</i>, one; <i>lamed</i>, thirty; and <i>heh</i>, five, is thirty-six. The total numerical value, three plus thirty-six, derived from the phrase: <b>“These are the things.”</b> This alludes to the <b>thirty-nine prohibited labors that were stated to Moses at Sinai.</b> |
| Exodus 35:3 | the verse states: “You shall not kindle fire | Shabbat 70a:4 | <b>I might have thought</b> that if <b>one performed them all in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> forgetting that they are prohibited, he would be <b>liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin-offering? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Six days you shall work, and on the seventh you shall rest; <b>in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest”</b> (Exodus 34:21), indicating that there are prohibitions specific to both plowing and harvesting. <b>And still I</b> can <b>say: For plowing and for the harvesting he is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings, as they were stated explicitly. <b>However, for</b> performing <b>all</b> the other prohibited labors, <b>he is liable for only one.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not kindle fire</b> in all your dwellings on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). This is derived in the following manner: <b>Kindling was</b> included <b>in the general</b> prohibition prohibiting all labors, <b>and why was it</b> singled <b>out</b> and prohibited explicitly? It was singled out in order <b>to equate</b> the other labors <b>to it and to tell you: Just as kindling is a primary category of prohibited labor, and one is liable for</b> performing <b>it on its own, so too,</b> with regard to <b>every primary category of prohibited labor, one is liable for</b> performing <b>it on its own.</b> |
| Exodus 35:3 | “You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations | Yevamot 6b:10 | Surprisingly, the <i>tanna</i> reverts back to his earlier claim: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> the case that capital punishments may be administered <b>even on Shabbat?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> by way of a verbal analogy: <b>“You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations</b> on Shabbat day” (Exodus 35:3) <b>and below it says,</b> at the end of the chapter dealing with murderers: <b>“And these things shall be for you a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your habitations”</b> (Numbers 35:29). |
| Exodus 35:3 | “You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations | Yevamot 6b:4 | § With regard to the issue at hand, the Gemara has not yet found an explanation as to why a specific inference was required to teach that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition that incurs <i>karet</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this claim might <b>be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>kindling, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations</b> on Shabbat day” (Exodus 35:3). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this, as the general prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat appears elsewhere? |
| Exodus 35:3 | the verse states: “You shall kindle no | Yevamot 7a:3 | The Gemara pauses in the middle of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference to explain this last point. This is derived <b>from</b> the superfluous phrase <b>“or for his sister”</b> in the verse “He shall not make himself ritually impure for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die” (Numbers 6:7), which is referring to a nazirite. This verse teaches that even a nazirite on his way to sacrifice the Paschal lamb must render himself ritually impure to bury a <i>met mitzva</i>. The Gemara resumes the <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If so, as <b>Shabbat is overridden by</b> the Temple <b>service, is it not right that the burial of a <i>met mitzva</i> should override it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall kindle no</b> fire throughout your habitations on Shabbat day” (Exodus 35:3). |
| Exodus 35:5 | have something to support them, as it is stated: “Whoever is of a willing heart, | Chagigah 10a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “Whoever is of a willing heart,</b> let him bring it” (Exodus 35:5). This verse indicates that as long as one retains the same desire to fulfill the vow, he must continue to fulfill it, but if he regrets taking the vow he may arrange for it to be dissolved. <b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother,</b> also <b>says: They have something to support them, as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). This verse indicates that certain oaths need not be fulfilled, i.e., those that have been dissolved. |
| Exodus 35:19 | garments, for serving in the Sanctuary” | Yoma 72a:13 | § The Gemara returns to its discussion of the priestly vestments: <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The plaited</b> [<b><i>serad</i></b>] <b>garments, for serving in the Sanctuary”</b> (Exodus 35:19)? Why does the verse refer to the priestly vestments as “<i>serad</i> garments”? |
| Exodus 35:22 | as many as were willinghearted, | Shevuot 26b:15 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;</b> according as you have vowed freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case in <b>which he expresses with his lips. From where</b> do I derive a case where <b>he decided</b> only <b>in his heart? The verse states</b> in the context of the contributions to the building of the Tabernacle: “And they came, both men and women, <b>as many as were willinghearted,</b> and brought nose rings, and earrings, and signet rings, and girdles, all jewels of gold” (Exodus 35:22). The fact that the verse describes those who contributed as willinghearted indicates that one becomes liable via a non-verbal decision. |
| Exodus 35:25 | it is written: “And every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands, | Shabbat 99a:2 | <b>Our Sages taught:</b> The <b>bottom curtains</b> in the Tabernacle were made <b>of sky blue</b> wool, <b>and of purple</b> wool, <b>and of scarlet</b> wool, <b>and of fine linen; and</b> the <b>top</b> curtains were made <b>of goat hair,</b> even though that material is considered to be inferior and common. However, <b>the wisdom that was stated with regard to the top</b> curtains <b>was greater than that which was stated with regard to the bottom ones. This is because, with regard to the bottom</b> curtains, <b>it is written: “And every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands,</b> and they brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the linen” (Exodus 35:25); <b>while with regard to the top</b> curtains, <b>it is written: “And all of the women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom spun the goats”</b> (Exodus 35:26). The phrase “whose hearts inspired them” suggests a greater degree of wisdom. Apparently, spinning the goat’s hair curtains required greater skill than spinning the various kinds of wool. <b>And</b> on a similar note, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya:</b> The hair <b>was rinsed on</b> the <b>goats, and it was</b> even <b>spun from the goats,</b> which required a great deal of skill. |
| Exodus 35:25 | with a spindle, and so it states: “And any woman who was wise-hearted spun with her hands” | Yoma 66b:12 | The Gemara cites another question posed to Rabbi Eliezer. <b>A wise woman asked Rabbi Eliezer: Since</b> all bore <b>equal</b> responsibility for the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf, due to what</b> factor were <b>their deaths not equal?</b> Some of the people were killed by the sword of Moses and the Levites, some were killed in a plague, and others were struck with an intestinal illness. <b>He said to her: There is no wisdom in a woman except</b> weaving <b>with a spindle, and so it states: “And any woman who was wise-hearted spun with her hands”</b> (Exodus 35:25). Therefore, it is unbefitting for a woman to concern herself with such questions. |
| Exodus 35:26 | Rabbi Neḥemya | Shabbat 74b:6 | We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>One who shears wool, and one who whitens it,</b> which are labors in the process of shearing and spinning wool. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who</b> unwittingly <b>spins wool</b> still attached <b>on the back of</b> an <b>animal on Shabbat is liable to</b> bring <b>three sin-offerings: One due to shearing,</b> since, in the process, some of the wool is detached from the sheep; <b>and one due to combing</b> the wool; <b>and one due to spinning. Rav Kahana said: This is not</b> a typical <b>manner of shearing, and this is not</b> a typical <b>manner of combing, and this is not</b> a typical <b>manner of spinning.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that <b>not</b> a typical manner of spinning? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> that the verse in the context of the work of the Tabernacle: “And all the women whose hearts lifted them with wisdom spun the goats” (Exodus 35:26) means that <b>they washed</b> the hair <b>on the goats, and they spun</b> it into threads <b>on the goats</b> themselves without first shearing the hair? <b>Apparently, spinning on the back of an animal is considered</b> a typical manner of <b>spinning.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Extraordinary wisdom is different.</b> Although certain individuals are capable of spinning wool that way, the typical person is not capable of performing that feat. |
| Exodus 35:26 | it is written: “And all of the women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom spun the goats” | Shabbat 99a:2 | <b>Our Sages taught:</b> The <b>bottom curtains</b> in the Tabernacle were made <b>of sky blue</b> wool, <b>and of purple</b> wool, <b>and of scarlet</b> wool, <b>and of fine linen; and</b> the <b>top</b> curtains were made <b>of goat hair,</b> even though that material is considered to be inferior and common.

The phrase “whose hearts inspired them” suggests a greater degree of wisdom.

| Exodus 35:27 | “And the rulers [ nesi’im ] brought the onyx [ shoham ] stones” | Yoma 75a:19 | § With regard to donations for the Tabernacle, the verse states: <b>“And they brought yet to him free-will offerings every morning”</b> (Exodus 36:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“every morning”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said:</b> They brought donations <b>from that which fell every morning</b> with the manna. <b>This teaches that pearls and precious stones fell for the Israelites with the manna.</b> It states: <b>“And the rulers [<i>nesi’im</i>] brought the onyx [<i>shoham</i>] stones”</b> (Exodus 35:27). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that the word <b><i>nesi’im</i></b> means <b>actual</b> clouds brought them. <b>As it states: “As clouds [<i>nesi’im</i>] and wind without rain</b> so is he that boasts himself of a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14). We learn from this that the precious stones fell from the clouds with the manna. |
| Exodus 35:30 | See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel, | Berakhot 55a:11 | With regard to Bezalel’s appointment, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One may only appoint a leader over a community if he consults with the community</b> and they agree to the appointment, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Moses said unto the children of Israel: <b>See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel,</b> son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah” (Exodus 35:30). <b>The Lord said to Moses: Moses, is Bezalel</b> a <b>suitable</b> appointment in <b>your</b> eyes? Moses <b>said to Him: Master of the universe, if he is</b> a <b>suitable</b> appointment in <b>Your</b> eyes, <b>then all the more so</b> in <b>my</b> eyes. The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to him: Nevertheless, go and tell</b> Israel and ask their opinion. Moses <b>went and said to Israel: Is Bezalel suitable</b> in <b>your</b> eyes? <b>They said to him: If he is suitable</b> in the eyes of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, and</b> in <b>your</b> eyes, <b>all the more so</b> he is suitable in <b>our</b> eyes. |
| Exodus 36:3 | “And they brought yet to him free-will offerings every morning” | Yoma 75a:19 | § With regard to donations for the Tabernacle, the verse states: <b>“And they brought yet to him free-will offerings every morning”</b> (Exodus 36:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“every morning”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said:</b> They brought donations <b>from that which fell every morning</b> with the manna. <b>This teaches that pearls and precious stones fell for the Israelites with the manna.</b> It states: <b>“And the rulers [<i>nesi’im</i>] brought the onyx [<i>shoham</i>] stones”</b> (Exodus 35:27). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that the word <b><i>nesi’im</i></b> means <b>actual</b> clouds brought them. <b>As it states: “As clouds [<i>nesi’im</i>] and wind without rain</b> so is he that boasts himself of a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14). We learn from this that the precious stones fell from the clouds with the manna. |
| Exodus 36:4 | every man from his work that they did” | Sanhedrin 69b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that in earlier generations men fathered children at the age of eight? <b>From here,</b> as it is written: <b>“And Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</b> made all that the Lord commanded Moses” (Exodus 38:22). <b>And it is written: “And Azubah died, and Caleb took for himself Ephrat, who bore him Hur.</b> And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). <b>And when Bezalel made the Tabernacle how old was he?</b> He must have been at least <b>thirteen years old, as it is written:</b> “And all the wise men that carried out all the work of the sanctuary, came <b>every man from his work that they did”</b> (Exodus 36:4), and one who is less than thirteen is not called a man. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the first year</b> following the exodus from Egypt <b>Moses made the Tabernacle; in the second</b> year <b>he erected the Tabernacle and sent out the spies.</b> |
| Exodus 36:4 | each one from the work he was doing” | Shabbat 96b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they were</b> not in a straight line but <b>staggered.</b> That would enable the weavers to sit adjacent to each other without disturbing each other’s work. <b>And furthermore, did they borrow from each another? Wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> of the Sage <b>Luda?</b> The verse states: “And all the wise men who performed all of the work of the Sanctuary came, <b>each one from the work he was doing”</b> (Exodus 36:4). From that verse it is derived: Each <b>performed</b> the labor <b>from his own work, and they would not perform</b> the labor <b>from their friends’ work.</b> Each person had his own tools and did not need to borrow from others. |
| Exodus 36:6 | with the blast of the shofar ,” and it is written elsewhere: “And Moses commanded, and they caused to be proclaimed [ vaya’aviru ] throughout the camp” | Rosh Hashanah34a:17 | As for the concern that one might think the verse means: <b>You shall</b> merely <b>carry</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>by hand</b> and not sound it, <b>you cannot</b> in any event <b>say</b> that, as that <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> by verbal analogy between the root <b><i>avara</i></b> used here and the same root <b><i>avara</i></b> that is found <b>with</b> regard to <b>Moses. It is written here: “Then you shall make proclamation</b> [<b><i>veha’avarta</i></b>] <b>with the blast of the <i>shofar</i>,” and it is written elsewhere: “And Moses commanded, and they caused to be proclaimed [<i>vaya’aviru</i>] throughout the camp”</b> (Exodus 36:6). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Moses, they proclaimed <b>with a sound, so too here,</b> the proclamation must be <b>with a sound.</b> |
| Exodus 36:6 | a term of proclamation, as it is stated: “And Moses gave the commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed [ vaya’aviru ] throughout the camp” | Sotah 3a:3 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person commits a transgression in private and the Holy One, Blessed be He, proclaims about him openly,</b> i.e., in public, that he transgressed, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning a <i>sota</i>, who transgressed in private: <b>“The spirit of jealousy came [<i>avar</i>] upon him”</b> (Numbers 5:14); <b>and</b> the term <b><i>avira</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a term of proclamation, as it is stated: “And Moses gave the commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed [<i>vaya’aviru</i>] throughout the camp”</b> (Exodus 36:6). |
| Exodus 36:7 | “For the labor they had was sufficient | Shabbat 49b:9 | Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: I cannot reach a conclusion relying solely on a count because there is another instance of the term labor, whose meaning is not clear to me. The reason <b>I am uncertain is because it is written</b> with regard to the Tabernacle: <b>“For the labor they had was sufficient</b> for all the work to do it, and too much” (Exodus 36:7). The question arises whether or not <b>this</b> mention of labor <b>is</b> included <b>in the count</b> of thirty-nine instances, i.e., whether or not it refers to actual labor. <b>And</b> if it does, <b>that</b> verse with regard to Joseph should be understood <b>in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that the expression, to do his labor, is a euphemism. It means that it was <b>to attend to his needs</b> and engage in relations with Potiphar’s wife that <b>he entered.</b> |
| Exodus 36:7 | as it is written: “And the work was sufficient for them | Shabbat 96b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And how do</b> you know that <b>he was standing</b> and commanding the people <b>on Shabbat? Perhaps he was standing during the week, and</b> Moses commanded the cessation of contributions <b>because the labor</b> of the Tabernacle <b>was completed,</b> since all the necessary material was already donated, <b>as it is written: “And the work was sufficient for them</b> for all of the work to perform it, and there was extra” (Exodus 36:7). Rather, <b>derive</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between <b>passing</b> mentioned in this context and <b>passing</b> mentioned with regard to <b>Yom Kippur.</b> |
| Exodus 38:4 | under the karkov beneath, reaching halfway up” | Zevachim 62a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, <b>under the <i>karkov</i> beneath, reaching halfway up”</b> (Exodus 38:4), which indicates that the <i>karkov</i> was on the side of the altar and not on top of it? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There were two</b> entities called <i>karkov</i>. <b>One</b> was a slight protrusion above the midway point of the altar <b>for aesthetic</b> purposes, <b>and one</b> was an indentation on top of the altar <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>the priests,</b> to ensure <b>that they</b> would <b>not slip</b> off the top of the altar. |
| Exodus 38:14 | cubits for the one side” | Zevachim 60a:1 | <b>cubits for the one side”</b> (Exodus 38:14), which indicates that the height of the curtains surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle was fifteen cubits. <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And the height <b>five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18)? It is referring to the height of the curtains <b>from the</b> upper <b>edge of the altar and above;</b> the curtains surrounding the courtyard were five cubits higher than the altar. |
| Exodus 38:15 | And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; | Eruvin 2b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive</b> the maximum width of a doorway <b>from the doorway of the gate of the courtyard</b> of the Tabernacle. <b>As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <b>And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> is considered a doorway, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruv</i>, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> should be considered a doorway. |
| Exodus 38:22 | “And Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, | Sanhedrin 69b:18 | The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that in earlier generations men fathered children at the age of eight? <b>From here,</b> as it is written: <b>“And Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</b> made all that the Lord commanded Moses” (Exodus 38:22). <b>And it is written: “And Azubah died, and Caleb took for himself Ephrat, who bore him Hur.</b> And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). <b>And when Bezalel made the Tabernacle how old was he?</b> He must have been at least <b>thirteen years old, as it is written:</b> “And all the wise men that carried out all the work of the sanctuary, came <b>every man from his work that they did”</b> (Exodus 36:4), and one who is less than thirteen is not called a man. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the first year</b> following the exodus from Egypt <b>Moses made the Tabernacle; in the second</b> year <b>he erected the Tabernacle and sent out the spies.</b> |
| Exodus 38:23 | “And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, | Arakhin 16b:20 | <b>And the Master says:</b> Hiram’s <b>mother</b> was also <b>from the house of Dan,</b> as the verse states about him: “The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan” (II Chronicles 2:13). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to those who constructed the Tabernacle: <b>“And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,</b> a craftsman, and a skillful workman, and a weaver in colors, in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen” (Exodus 38:23). This teaches that Hiram continued in the craft of brass work, the craft of his father’s family and also of his mother’s family from Dan. |
| Exodus 38:25 | “And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents” | Bekhorot 5a:13 | <b>Rav Aḥai discusses it: What posed a difficulty for</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai that forced him to offer this answer? Was it the verse: <b>“And the hundred talents of silver were for casting</b> the sockets of the Sanctuary” (Exodus 38:27)? If so, one can explain that <b>these</b> one hundred talents were designated <b>for casting</b> the sockets, <b>and the other</b> one hundred talents that are not mentioned here were placed in <b>the treasury.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>another verse is written</b> that discusses the total sum collected, and only one hundred talents are mentioned: <b>“And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents”</b> (Exodus 38:25). |
| Exodus 38:26 | “A beka a head, that is, half a shekel, of the shekel of the Sanctuary | Bekhorot 5a:10 | <b>Additionally,</b> Kontrokos <b>asked</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>With regard to the collection of silver</b> by Moses for the Tabernacle, <b>you find</b> that the total amount is <b>201 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>, as it is written</b> that they amassed: <b>“A <i>beka</i> a head, that is, half a shekel, of the shekel of the Sanctuary</b>…for 603,550 men” (Exodus 38:26), which totals 301,775 shekels. This sum equals 201 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>, as each talent contains 1,500 shekels, or sixty <i>maneh</i>, and each <i>maneh</i> contains twenty-five shekels. |
| Exodus 38:27 | one hundred talents, as it is written: “And the hundred talents of silver were for casting” | Bekhorot 5a:11 | <b>But with regard to the giving of the silver</b> to the Tabernacle <b>you find</b> only <b>one hundred talents, as it is written: “And the hundred talents of silver were for casting”</b> (Exodus 38:27). Now, <b>was Moses your teacher a thief, or was he a gambler [<i>kuveyustus</i>], or</b> was he <b>not expert in accounting?

| Exodus 38:27 | “And the hundred talents of silver were for casting | Bekhorot 5a:13 | <b>Rav Aḥai discusses it: What posed a difficulty for</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai that forced him to offer this answer?

| Exodus 38:27 | itself | Bekhorot 5a:15 | <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>itself</b> that Kontrokos mentioned (Exodus 38:27), then the derivation would be <b>as</b> follows: In addition to the one hundred talents, additional silver coins are mentioned <b>here</b> that equal <b>seventy-one <i>maneh</i>,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And of the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars”</b> (Exodus 38:28), which is equal to one talent, or sixty <i>maneh</i>, plus an additional eleven <i>maneh</i>, <b>and the verse counted them only</b> using the value <b>of small coins,</b> i.e., shekels, and not in talents. <b>And if it is so</b> that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was of equal value to a common <i>maneh</i>, then the verse <b>should have</b> expressed this value using larger coins, writing: <b>101 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 38:28 | “And of the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars” | Bekhorot 5a:15 | <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>itself</b> that Kontrokos mentioned (Exodus 38:27), then the derivation would be <b>as</b> follows: In addition to the one hundred talents, additional silver coins are mentioned <b>here</b> that equal <b>seventy-one <i>maneh</i>,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And of the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars”</b> (Exodus 38:28), which is equal to one talent, or sixty <i>maneh</i>, plus an additional eleven <i>maneh</i>, <b>and the verse counted them only</b> using the value <b>of small coins,</b> i.e., shekels, and not in talents. <b>And if it is so</b> that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was of equal value to a common <i>maneh</i>, then the verse <b>should have</b> expressed this value using larger coins, writing: <b>101 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>.</b> |
| Exodus 38:29 | from here: “And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels” | Bekhorot 5a:18 | <b>Rather, the principle</b> that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary is double the value of a common <i>maneh</i> is derived <b>from here: “And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels”</b> (Exodus 38:29). The Gemara explains: Aside from the seventy talents mentioned, <b>there are</b> an additional <b>ninety-six <i>maneh</i> here,</b> which is equivalent to one talent and an additional thirty-six <i>maneh</i>, <b>and the verse counts them only</b> using the value <b>of small coins. Learn from it</b> that <b>a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was double</b> the amount of a standard <i>maneh</i>, and that is why the number of shekels mentioned did not equal a full talent. |
| Exodus 39:3 | and cut it into cords, | Yoma 72a:6 | But couldn’t one <b>say</b> the <b>gold</b> should be made as a thread of <b>six</b> strands, like the other colors? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And they beat the gold into thin plates, <b>and cut it into cords,</b> to work it into the sky-blue, and into the purple, and into the scarlet, and into the fine linen, the work of a skilled craftsman” (Exodus 39:3). <b>“Cord”</b> implies a strand that is doubled over and can be twisted into a cord; <b>“cords”</b> is in the plural, meaning at least two of these. <b>Accordingly, there are four</b> strands <b>here.</b> |
| Exodus 39:3 | “To work it into the sky-blue, and into the purple” | Yoma 72a:7 | <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This can be seen from that fact that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the gold strands: <b>“To work it into the sky-blue, and into the purple”</b> (Exodus 39:3), indicating that the gold strands should be combined with the other colors. <b>What</b> should <b>we do?</b> If <b>we make four</b> gold threads <b>of two</b> strands <b>each</b> and combine each one with each of the colors, then <b>there would be eight.</b> If <b>we make two</b> gold threads <b>of two</b> strands <b>each, and two</b> gold threads <b>of one</b> strand <b>each,</b> it says: <b>“And you shall make,”</b> indicating <b>that all its makings should be the same.</b> Perforce, one strand of gold should be combined with each of the colors, producing a total of twenty-eight strands. |
| Exodus 39:22 | all of sky-blue wool” | Zevachim 88b:2 | § With regard to the priestly vestments, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The robe</b> of the High Priest <b>was</b> sewn <b>entirely of sky-blue wool, as it is stated: “And he made the robe of the ephod</b> of woven work, <b>all of sky-blue wool”</b> (Exodus 39:22). With regard to <b>its skirts,</b> concerning which it states: “And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of sky blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined” (Exodus 39:24), <b>how</b> were they fashioned? The tailor <b>brings sky-blue wool, and purple wool, and scarlet wool,</b> which are <b>twined</b> together, <b>and fashions them</b> to appear <b>as pomegranates that have not opened their mouths,</b> i.e., they are sewn in the appearance of pomegranates that are not yet ripe enough for the crown on top to open, <b>and as</b> the <b>cones [<i>konaot</i>] of</b> the <b>helmets [<i>kenasot</i>] that</b> are found <b>on the heads of children.</b> |
| Exodus 39:24 | As it is written: “And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of sky-blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined” | Yoma 71b:10 | The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>. That the use of the term <b>twined</b> implies that the thread should be spun from <b>eight</b> strands, <b>from where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of sky-blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined”</b> (Exodus 39:24); <b>and derive</b> a verbal analogy from the term <b>“twined”</b> used in this verse and the term <b>“twined” from</b> the verse about <b>the curtain: Just as there,</b> with regard to the curtain, there are <b>twenty-four</b> strands, as will be explained, <b>so too here,</b> there are <b>twenty-four</b> strands in total. And since each pomegranate is made of three colors, sky-blue, purple, and scarlet, it must be <b>that each one of them was</b> spun from <b>eight</b> strands. |
| Exodus 39:24 | its skirts, | Zevachim 88b:2 | § With regard to the priestly vestments, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The robe</b> of the High Priest <b>was</b> sewn <b>entirely of sky-blue wool, as it is stated: “And he made the robe of the ephod</b> of woven work, <b>all of sky-blue wool”</b> (Exodus 39:22).

| Exodus 39:25 | And | Zevachim 88b:3 | <b>And</b> in order to fulfill that which is stated: “And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates” (Exodus 39:25), he <b>brings seventy-two bells,</b> i.e., the outer part of bells, made from gold, <b>that</b> contain <b>inside them seventy-two bell clappers, and he suspends</b> them <b>on</b> the skirts: <b>Thirty-six</b> of each, i.e., pomegranates and bells, <b>on this side</b> of the robe, <b>and thirty-six</b> of each <b>on that side,</b> as the verse states: “A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe around it” (Exodus 39:26). <b>Rabbi Dosa says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: There were thirty-six</b> bells suspended around the skirt, <b>eighteen from this side and eighteen from that side.</b> |
| Exodus 39:26 | “A bell [ pa’amon ] and a pomegranate” | Sotah 9b:22 | The verse continues: <b>“To move him [<i>lefa’amo</i>] in Mahaneh Dan.” Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Divine Presence jangled before him,</b> inspiring him, <b>like a bell [<i>zog</i>],</b> as <b>it is written here: “To move him [<i>lefa’amo</i>] in Mahaneh Dan,” and it is written there</b> with regard to the clothing of the High Priest: <b>“A bell [<i>pa’amon</i>] and a pomegranate”</b> (Exodus 39:26). |
| Exodus 39:26 | on that side, | Zevachim 88b:3 | <b>And</b> in order to fulfill that which is stated: “And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates” (Exodus 39:25), he <b>brings seventy-two bells,</b> i.e., the outer part of bells, made from gold, <b>that</b> contain <b>inside them seventy-two bell clappers, and he suspends</b> them <b>on</b> the skirts: <b>Thirty-six</b> of each, i.e., pomegranates and bells, <b>on this side</b> of the robe, <b>and thirty-six</b> of each <b>on that side,</b> as the verse states: “A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe around it” (Exodus 39:26). <b>Rabbi Dosa says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: There were thirty-six</b> bells suspended around the skirt, <b>eighteen from this side and eighteen from that side.</b> |
| Exodus 39:30 | a writing, | Gittin 20b:1 | <b>isn’t there a need</b> to write it, as the verse states with regard to the frontplate: “Wrote upon it <b>a writing,</b> like the engravings of a signet” (Exodus 39:30), <b>and there is no</b> writing here? The Gemara answers: It means that the frontplate was fashioned <b>like</b> the form of <b>gold dinars</b> but <b>not</b> entirely <b>like</b> the form of <b>gold dinars.</b> It was fashioned <b>like</b> the form of <b>gold dinars</b> in <b>that</b> the writing <b>protrudes.

Since the letters were carved directly, it was considered to be writing. |
| Exodus 40:3 | and you shall place a cover over [al] the Ark with the Curtain” | Menachot 62a:13 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the shewbread, the verse states: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: <i>Al</i></b> in this instance means: <b>Next to.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means: <b>Next to? Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> means <b>only actually upon?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>When it says:</b> “And you shall put there the Ark of the Testimony, <b>and you shall place a cover over [al] the Ark with the Curtain”</b> (Exodus 40:3), the word <i>al</i> cannot mean upon, as the Curtain that separated the Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies was hanging near the Ark, not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>next to.</b> |
| Exodus 40:3 | When it says: “And you shall place the Curtain as a screen next to [ al ] the Ark” | Menachot 98a:19 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Hamnuna, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that the word <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall place pure frankincense by [<i>al</i>] each arrangement”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). The preposition <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> in this verse means that the frankincense is <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread. <b>Do you say</b> that <b><i>al</i></b> means <b>adjacent to</b> the shewbread, <b>or</b> perhaps it means <b>nothing other than</b> that the frankincense was <b>literally upon</b> the shewbread? <b>When it says: “And you shall place the Curtain as a screen next to [<i>al</i>] the Ark”</b> (Exodus 40:3), it is evident that “<i>al</i>” does not mean upon the Ark, as the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was hung in front of the Ark and not placed on top of it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that the word <b><i>al</i></b> can also mean <b>adjacent to.</b> |
| Exodus 40:3 | “And you shall screen the Ark [ al haAron ] | Sotah 37a:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense on [<i>al</i>] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: “<i>Al</i>”</b> in this instance means <b>adjacent to.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to, or</b> perhaps it carries <b>only</b> its <b>literal</b> meaning of <b>“on”? When it says</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall screen the Ark [<i>al haAron</i>]</b> with the curtain” (Exodus 40:3), the word “<i>al</i>” cannot mean on, as the curtain that separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was not placed on top of the Ark, but near it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to.</b> |
| Exodus 40:3 | as it is written: “And you shall screen [ vesakkota ] the Ark with the curtain” | Sukkah 7b:8 | <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said in the name of Abaye: What is the rationale for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And you shall screen [<i>vesakkota</i>] the Ark with the curtain”</b> (Exodus 40:3). <b>The curtain is a partition</b> and not a covering over the Ark, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One calls it roofing [<i>sekhakha</i>]. Apparently, we require</b> the purpose of <b>a partition</b> to be <b>similar</b> to the purpose of <b>roofing;</b> just as the roofing must be mostly impermeable by sunlight, so must the partition. |
| Exodus 40:7 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Since it is stated: “And you shall set the Basin between the Tent of Meeting | Zevachim 58b:16 | <b>And Rav Sherevya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna in <i>Tamid</i>, which holds that the entire altar was located in the northern part of the Temple courtyard? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Since it is stated: “And you shall set the Basin between the Tent of Meeting</b> and the altar” (Exodus 40:7), and another verse states: <b>“And</b> |
| Exodus 40:10 | the altar [ et hamizbe’aḥ ]” | Zevachim 87a:11 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Just as the altar sanctifies</b> items, so too, the ramp and the service vessels sanctify items. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Whatever <b>touches the altar</b> shall be sacred” (Exodus 29:37). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>altar</b> sanctifies items. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>ramp</b> sanctifies items as well? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall anoint…<b>the altar [<i>et hamizbe’aḥ</i>]”</b> (Exodus 40:10), and the addition of the word <i>et</i> serves to include the ramp. With regard to <b>service vessels, from where</b> is it derived that they sanctify items? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to them: <b>“Whatever touches them shall be sacred”</b> (Exodus 30:29). |
| Exodus 40:17 | And it says: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, | Rosh Hashanah3a:12 | <b>And it is written: “After he had slain Sihon,</b> the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon” (Deuteronomy 1:4). <b>And it says: “And when the Canaanite,</b> the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, <b>heard”</b> (Numbers 33:40). <b>And it says: “And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead,</b> and they wept for Aaron thirty days” (Numbers 20:29). <b>And it says: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,</b> on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established” (Exodus 40:17). |
| Exodus 40:17 | as it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established” | Rosh Hashanah3a:5 | The Gemara rejects this proposal: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established”</b> (Exodus 40:17), <b>and it is written: “And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month,</b> on the twentieth day of the month, <b>that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the testimony”</b> (Numbers 10:11). It may be argued as follows: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of Nisan,</b> which is the first month, <b>it calls it “the second year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Iyyar,</b> which is the second month, <b>it</b> also <b>calls it “the second year,” by inference, Rosh HaShana is not</b> at the beginning of <b>Iyyar.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Iyyar, Nisan and the following Iyyar would not occur in the same year, as the year would have changed in Iyyar. |
| Exodus 40:17 | “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was erected” | Shabbat 87b:6 | <b>Rav Ḥavivi from Ḥozena’a said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from the following verse: <b>“And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was erected”</b> (Exodus 40:17). It <b>was taught: That day took ten crowns.</b> It was <b>the first</b> day <b>of Creation,</b> meaning Sunday, <b>the first</b> day <b>of</b> the offerings brought by the <b>princes, the first</b> day <b>of the priesthood, the first</b> day <b>of service</b> in the Temple, <b>the first</b> time <b>for the descent of fire</b> onto the altar, <b>the first</b> time that <b>consecrated</b> foods <b>were eaten, the first</b> day of <b>the resting of the Divine Presence</b> upon the Jewish people, <b>the first</b> day that <b>the Jewish people were blessed</b> by the priests, and <b>the first</b> day <b>of the prohibition</b> to bring offerings on <b>improvised altars.</b> Once the Tabernacle was erected, it was prohibited to offer sacrifices elsewhere. And it was the <b>first of the months. And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>New Moon</b> of <b>Nisan</b> of <b>that year</b> was on <b>the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> in <b>the previous year,</b> it was on <b>the fourth</b> day <b>of the week.</b> |
| Exodus 40:17 | As it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was erected” | Taanit 29a:2 | § The mishna taught: <b>On the Ninth of Av, it was decreed upon our ancestors that they would not enter Eretz</b> Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was erected”</b> (Exodus 40:17). <b>And the Master said:</b> In the <b>first year</b> after leaving Egypt, <b>Moses built the Tabernacle.</b> At the beginning of the <b>second</b> year, <b>Moses erected the Tabernacle and sent</b> the <b>spies. And it is written: “And it came to pass in the second year in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from the Tabernacle of the Testimony”</b> (Numbers 10:11). |
| Exodus 40:18 | as the verse states: “And Moses erected the Tabernacle, and he laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and erected its pillars” | Menachot 99a:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one does not downgrade</b> in matters of sanctity? <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And Moses erected the Tabernacle, and he laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and erected its pillars”</b> (Exodus 40:18). This teaches that once Moses, who was at a greater level of sanctity than the rest of the people, began the work of erecting the Tabernacle, he alone completed it. |
| Exodus 40:19 | as it is stated: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle” | Bekhorot 44a:15 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says: Moses, our teacher, was ten <i>ammot</i></b> tall, <b>as it is stated: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19). <b>Who spread</b> the tent over the Tabernacle? <b>Moses, our teacher, spread it, and it is written</b> with regard to the height of the Tabernacle: <b>“Ten <i>ammot</i> shall be the length of a board”</b> (Exodus 26:16). Moses must have been at least as tall as the Tabernacle itself for him to have spread the tent over it. |
| Exodus 40:19 | mighty, as it is written: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle” | Nedarim 38a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence only upon</b> one who is <b>mighty, and wealthy, and wise, and humble. And all of these</b> qualities are derived <b>from Moses.</b> He was <b>mighty, as it is written: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19), <b>and the Master said: Moses, our teacher, spread it</b> himself. <b>And it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a board,</b> and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board” (Exodus 26:16). Moses was tall and strong enough to spread the tent over the boards alone. The Gemara asks: <b>Say that he was tall and thin,</b> and the fact that he was mighty cannot be derived. |
| Exodus 40:19 | and it is written there: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle, | Shabbat 28a:1 | written in the context of the <b>Tabernacle. It is written here,</b> in the discussion of the laws of ritual impurity: <b>“This is the law: When a man dies in a tent,</b> every one that comes into the tent, and everything that is in the tent, shall be impure seven days” (Numbers 19:14), <b>and it is written there: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle,</b> and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses” (Exodus 40:19). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, the tent was made <b>of linen</b> and <b>is considered a tent, so too, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, only a tent made <b>of linen is considered a tent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, derive the following from that same verbal analogy: <b>Just as below</b> the linen threads in the Tabernacle were specifically threads that were <b>twisted</b> and <b>the threads were folded six times, so too, here,</b> in all of the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to a tent over a corpse, the threads must be <b>twisted and their threads folded six times. The verse states</b> the word <b>tent, tent</b> several times to <b>amplify</b> and include even a tent made of linen not identical to the Tabernacle. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the repetition of the word <b>tent, tent</b> several times <b>amplifies, even all things</b> should be included among those items that can receive ritual impurity as a tent. The Gemara answers: This amplification cannot be that far-reaching, as, <b>if so,</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> of tent, tent, that teaches us to derive the tent over a corpse from the Tabernacle, <b>what purpose does it serve</b> if everything is included? Rather, certainly the amplification is not absolute. Through the combination of the verbal analogy and the amplification, it is derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to linen. |
| Exodus 40:19 | “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle, | Shabbat 92a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Tabernacle itself</b> was carried above ten handbreadths? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written:</b> “And you shall make the boards for the Tabernacle out of acacia wood standing upright, <b>the length of a board shall be ten cubits”</b> (Exodus 26:15–16). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to the construction of the Tabernacle: <b>“And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle,</b> and he placed the cover for the tent on top of it as God commanded Moses” (Exodus 40:19). <b>And Rav said: Moses, our teacher, spread it</b> himself. <b>From here you</b> can <b>derive that the height of the Levites was ten cubits.</b> If Moses was capable of standing and spreading the cover over the tent by himself, he must have been at least ten cubits tall. Presumably, that was the height of the rest of the Levites as well. <b>And</b> they <b>learned</b> through tradition that <b>every burden that is carried with poles, one-third</b> of the burden <b>is above</b> the porter’s height, <b>and two-thirds are below</b> his height. <b>It is found,</b> then, <b>that</b> the altar <b>was very high,</b> as if they carried the altar on poles, the bottom of the altar was at least one-third of ten cubits, twenty handbreadths, off the ground. |
| Exodus 40:19 | “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle” | Sukkah 21a:1 | <b>He derives</b> by means of a verbal analogy that only a man-made tent transmits impurity, deriving the <b>tent</b> written with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse <b>from</b> the <b>tent</b> written with regard to the <b>Tabernacle. It is written here</b> with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse: <b>“This is the teaching when a man dies in a tent”</b> (Numbers 19:14). <b>And it is written there</b> with regard to the Tabernacle: <b>“And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, the tent was established <b>by a person, so too here,</b> with regard to impurity of a corpse, it is a tent established <b>by a person. And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis,</b> because the passage dealing with impurity imparted by a corpse, i.e., <b>tent tent, is</b> repeated several times, this <b>amplifies</b> and includes any structure that provides shelter, even if it is not a standard tent. |
| Exodus 40:29 | the altar of the burnt offering | Zevachim 59a:1 | <b>the altar of the burnt offering</b> he set at the entrance to the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.” (Exodus 40:29), indicating that no object was allowed to be located between the altar and the Tent of Meeting, whose parallel, in the Temple, was the Sanctuary. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives from these verses that only the <b>altar</b> stood <b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, but</b> the <b>Basin</b> did <b>not</b> stand <b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Where would</b> they <b>place</b> the Basin? It was placed <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar, extended slightly toward the south.</b> Therefore, although the Basin was closer to the Sanctuary than the altar was, it did not actually stand between the altar and the Sanctuary. |
| Exodus 40:31 | “That Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and their feet from it” | Zevachim 19b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The principle is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the Basin in the Temple: <b>“That Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and their feet from it”</b> (Exodus 40:31). One may derive from the verse that <b>anything that is indispensable with regard to his sons is indispensable with regard to him.</b> But <b>anything that is not indispensable with regard to his sons is not indispensable with regard to him.</b> |
| Exodus 40:31 | from it” | Zevachim 21b:12 | § Having mentioned a <i>halakha</i> earlier (19b), the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> With regard to <b>any Basin that does not contain enough</b> water <b>for four priests to sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>from it,</b> the priests <b>may not sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>with it, as it is stated: “That Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash</b> their hands and their feet <b>from it”</b> (Exodus 40:31). |
| Exodus 40:32 | and when they came near to the altar, they shall wash” | Zevachim 119b:20 | <b>A partition for</b> the <b>blood,</b> i.e., the red line that divides the altar, as the blood of some offerings, e.g., a sin offering, was sprinkled above the line, and the blood of other offerings, e.g., a burnt offering, was sprinkled below the line, was required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the net may reach halfway up the altar”</b> (Exodus 27:5). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applied only to the altar in the Tabernacle. With regard to the requirement for <b>washing of hands</b> and feet before the service, it is required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written:</b> “When they went into the Tent of Meeting <b>and when they came near to the altar, they shall wash”</b> (Exodus 40:32). |
| Exodus 40:35 | “And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud dwelt on it” | Yoma 4b:9 | <b>Rabbi Zerika raised a contradiction between verses before Rabbi Elazar, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in one place: <b>“And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud dwelt on it”</b> (Exodus 40:35), as Moses was unable to enter the cloud. <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“And Moses came into the cloud”</b> (Exodus 24:18). <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, grabbed Moses and brought him into the cloud</b> since he could not enter on his own. |
