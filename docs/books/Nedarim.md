| Nedarim 6:5 | hear | Nedarim 75b:4 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Nedarim</i> 6:5): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to them: And just as in a situation where he cannot nullify his own vows once he has vowed, he can nullify his own vows before he vows</b> by stipulating beforehand that the vows he takes should not take effect, all the more so in <b>a situation where he can nullify his wife’s vows</b> even <b>after she vows, is it not logical that he should</b> be able to <b>nullify his wife’s vows before she vows?</b> |
