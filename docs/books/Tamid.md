| Tamid 2:5 | as we learned | Zevachim 58a:13 | Rabbi Zeira <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> a mishna that alludes to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 2:5): The priests <b>selected fine wood of a fig tree from</b> the chamber of firewood, with which <b>to lay out a second arrangement</b> of wood on the altar so that coals from this arrangement could be used <b>for</b> burning the <b>incense.</b> This second arrangement was located <b>opposite</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>distanced from</b> the <b>corner northward</b> by <b>four cubits.</b> They would arrange enough wood which, when burned, would produce <b>approximately five <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals. And on Shabbat,</b> there was enough wood to produce <b>approximately eight <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals, as they would place there the two bowls of frankincense of the shewbread.</b> |
| Tamid 3:6 | one of the Sages who explained to him | Bava Metzia33a:13 | <b>Rava said: For example, Rav Seḥora</b> is my teacher with regard to these matters, <b>as he explained to me</b> the meaning of the term in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 13:2) <b><i>zuhama listeron</i>,</b> a utensil with a spoon on one end and a fork on the other. <b>Shmuel rent his garment</b> in mourning <b>over</b> the passing of <b>one of the Sages who explained to him</b> the meaning of a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 3:6) that describes the two keys that opened the compartment through which the priest would enter the Sanctuary each morning: <b>One</b> is the key with which the priest would open the inside lock. He would insert his arm <b>up to his armpit</b> through a small opening in the door and reach <b>down</b> and open the lock that was at the bottom of the door on the inside, and he would go through that door into a compartment. <b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> is the key with <b>which</b> the priest <b>opened</b> the lock on the inner door of the compartment, through which he entered the Sanctuary, and he opened that lock <b>directly.</b> |
