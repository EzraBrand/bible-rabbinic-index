| Terumot 1:1 | we learned | Gittin 23b:3 | <b>But</b> what of <b>a gentile and a Samaritan, who are</b> included <b>in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>teruma</i> with regard to their own</b> produce, i.e., they must designate a portion of it for the priest, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): With regard to <b>a gentile and a Samaritan that separated</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from their own</b> produce, <b>their <i>teruma</i> is considered <i>teruma</i>. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a different mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:1): In the case of <b>a gentile who separated <i>teruma</i> from a Jew’s</b> produce, i.e., acted as his agent, <b>even</b> if he did so <b>with permission</b> from the Jew, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Terumot 1:1 | Let us say that | Yevamot 113a:12 | The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say that</b> the mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:1) <b>supports</b> Shmuel’s opinion: There are <b>five</b> categories of people who <b>may not separate <i>teruma</i></b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and if they separated <i>teruma</i>, their <i>teruma</i> is not</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>. They are: A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, and one who separates <i>teruma</i></b> from produce <b>that is not his, and a gentile who separated <i>teruma</i></b> from the produce <b>of a Jew even with the Jew’s permission.</b> In this last case, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not considered <i>teruma</i>,</b> because a gentile cannot be appointed as an agent to separate <i>teruma</i>, and all the more so he cannot separate <i>teruma</i> on his own. This shows that the actions of a deaf-mute have no effect, and are not even considered of doubtful validity. |
| Terumot 1:2 | teaches us as we learned | Chagigah 2b:3 | § The mishna taught: <b>Except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor.</b> The Gemara notes: By listing these three cases together the mishna <b>is teaching</b> that <b>a deaf-mute is similar to an imbecile and a minor: Just as an imbecile and a minor</b> are among those <b>who are not of sound mind, so too the deaf-mute [<i>ḥeresh</i>]</b> mentioned here is one <b>who is not of sound mind. And</b> this <b>teaches us as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>The <i>ḥeresh</i>, whom the Sages discussed everywhere,</b> is one <b>who does not hear and does not speak,</b> and therefore his mind is not lucid. It can be inferred from this that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak are obligated</b> in mitzvot like any other person. |
| Terumot 1:2 | learned this, as the Sages taught | Chagigah 2b:4 | The Gemara notes: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>One who speaks but does not hear, this is a deaf</b> person. One who <b>hears but does not speak, this is a mute.</b> Both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>are</b> in the same legal category <b>as those who can see and hear</b> with regard <b>to all matters.</b> This shows that the <i>ḥeresh</i> exempted by the Sages is one who neither hears nor speaks. |
| Terumot 1:2 | As we learned | Niddah 13b:14 | The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring <b>to</b> a woman who <b>can speak but cannot hear.</b> It is possible for such a woman to be an expert in examining blood. But <b>here,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a woman <b>who can neither speak nor hear,</b> and she is therefore considered incompetent and incapable of examining herself. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): The <b>deaf person</b> of <b>whom the Sages spoke everywhere</b> is one <b>who can neither hear nor speak,</b> i.e., a deaf-mute. |
| Terumot 1:3 | hear | Niddah 46b:14 | § The Gemara continues to discuss the validity of the vows of a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood. <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:3): With regard to <b>a minor who has not grown two hairs, Rabbi Yehuda says: His <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: Until he has reached the age of vows,</b> i.e., when he does not yet have the status of a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> but <b>once he has reached the age of vows, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Terumot 1:5 | there | Kiddushin 62a:11 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 1:5): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce that has been <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>for,</b> i.e., to render permitted, produce that is <b>attached</b> to the ground. Produce still attached to the ground is not included in the obligation of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if he separated <i>teruma</i></b> in this manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>,</b> even after the produce has been detached from the ground. |
| Terumot 2:2 | elsewhere | Yevamot 89a:6 | § The mishna taught that <b>the child</b> of either of the men is <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> To clarify this issue, the Gemara cites a different discussion. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 2:2): <b>One may not separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from ritually impure</b> produce in order <b>to</b> exempt <b>ritually pure</b> food, <b>and if he separated</b> <i>teruma</i> from impure food <b>unwittingly, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> If he acted <b>intentionally, he has done nothing,</b> that is, his action is of no effect. The Sages debated: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>He has done nothing? Rav Ḥisda said: He has done nothing at all,</b> meaning <b>that even that <i>griva</i></b> of produce he set aside as <i>teruma</i> <b>returns to</b> its former <b>untithed</b> state, as his entire act is completely disregarded. |
| Terumot 2:3 | As we learned | Bava Kamma71a:16 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): In the case of <b>one who cooks</b> food <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food, but if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food only <b>upon the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it <b>ever,</b> although others may partake of it. |
| Terumot 2:3 | hear | Gittin 54a:14 | The Gemara attempts to adduce further proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who tithes</b> produce <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is prohibited by rabbinic law because it appears as though he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he did this <b>unintentionally, he may consume</b> the produce, as it has been tithed and rendered fit for consumption. But if he did this <b>intentionally, he may not consume</b> it. Apparently, the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender, although tithing produce on Shabbat is prohibited by rabbinic law. The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a worthy deed and <b>repair</b> the produce by tithing it; <b>should we arise and penalize him?</b> As above, Rabbi Meir would agree that in such a case the unintentional offender is not penalized. |
| Terumot 2:3 | hear | Gittin 54a:15 | The Gemara brings yet another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in that same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who immerses utensils</b> in a ritual bath <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is also prohibited by the Sages because it appears as if he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he immerses them <b>unintentionally, he may use them.</b> But if he immerses them <b>intentionally, he may not use them.</b> Here too the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender. The Gemara answers as before: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a praiseworthy act and <b>purify the utensils; should we arise and penalize him?</b> The same distinction stated previously applies in this mishna as well. |
| Terumot 2:4 | there | Bekhorot 53b:17 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): <b>One may not separate the portion of the produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>] from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>to</b> exempt another type of produce <b>that is not its type, and if one did separate <i>teruma</i></b> in that manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says,</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the grain,</b> the first part of them, which they give to the Lord, to you have I given them” (Numbers 18:12). <b>The Torah says: Give the best,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>of this,</b> the oil, <b>and the best of that,</b> the wine, separately, i.e., one may not give <i>teruma</i> or tithes from one for the other. This mitzva also applies to tithes, as it too is called: “The best” (Numbers 18:30). |
| Terumot 2:4 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 55a:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where there is a priest</b> present, and the owner of the produce can give him the <i>teruma</i> without delay, then even in <b>a place where he is not accustomed</b> to make dried figs, <b>why</b> may he <b>not</b> set aside fresh figs for dried ones? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): In <b>a place where there is a priest</b> present, the owner of the produce <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from the</b> best-quality produce? In this case, the fresh figs are superior in quality to the dried ones, despite the fact that dried figs last longer. |
| Terumot 2:4 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 55a:7 | <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where there is no priest</b> present, and by the time a priest is found the fresh figs might spoil. If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> set aside <i>teruma</i> from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs even in a place where they are accustomed to make</b> fresh <b>figs</b> into <b>dried figs. And if</b> this is referring to a situation <b>where there is no priest</b> present, <b>why</b> may one <b>not</b> set aside dried figs, which can be preserved for a lengthy period, for fresh ones? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): In <b>a place where there is no priest</b> present, the owner of the produce <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from that which will endure,</b> not from the best-quality produce? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that this clause is referring to a situation <b>where there is a priest</b> present. |
| Terumot 2:4 | And we learned | Temurah 5a:11 | The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of one who separates <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>to</b> exempt <b>another type</b> of produce, <b>as the Merciful One states: “All the best of the oil,</b> and all the best of the wine, and of the grain, the first part of them which they give to the Lord” (Numbers 18:12)? This teaches that one is obligated <b>to give the best of one</b> type of produce <b>and the best of another</b> type of produce, each individually. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>for another type, and if one did separate <i>teruma</i></b> in that manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Apparently,</b> the transgression <b>is not effective.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b> |
| Terumot 2:4 | we learned | Temurah 5a:8 | And the Sages interpret this verse as follows: “Of all <b>the best thereof,” yes,</b> but one should <b>not</b> separate <b>poor-quality</b> produce. <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce, <b>and if one did separate <i>teruma</i></b> in that manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Apparently,</b> his action <b>is effective,</b> which is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> |
| Terumot 2:12 | As it is taught | Gittin 8a:4 | <b>As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 2:12): <b>What is Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and what is outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>Any</b> slope <b>that descends at an angle from Turei Amnon</b> in Syria <b>and inward</b> toward Eretz Yisrael is part of <b>Eretz Yisrael. From Turei Amnon and outward,</b> northward, is considered <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. With regard to <b>the islands [<i>nissin</i>] that are in the sea, one views them as though a string were pulled taut over them from Turei Amnon</b> in the north <b>to the River of Egypt,</b> Wadi el-Arish, in the south. <b>From the string and inward,</b> i.e., east, is <b>Eretz Yisrael; from the string and outward,</b> west, is considered <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. This is the opinion of the Rabbis. |
| Terumot 3:1 | But didn’t we learn | Kiddushin 46b:12 | The Gemara questions this assumption: <b>And will</b> one <b>not listen</b> to a ruling to separate <i>teruma</i> a second time from a single container? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:1): In the case of <b>one who separated a cucumber</b> as <b><i>teruma</i></b> to give to a priest, <b>and</b> that cucumber <b>was found</b> to be so <b>bitter</b> that it was inedible, or if he separated <b>a melon and it was found</b> to be <b>spoiled,</b> his separation is still <b><i>teruma</i>, but he must separate <i>teruma</i> again?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is full-fledged <i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> and even if he does not listen and separate <i>teruma</i> again, no Torah law will be violated. |
| Terumot 3:1 | different from that which we learned | Yevamot 89a:8 | The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:1): With regard to <b>one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> from <b>a serpent melon [<i>kishut</i>] and it was discovered</b> to be <b>bitter,</b> or from <b>a watermelon and it was discovered</b> to be <b>spoiled,</b> it is <b><i>teruma</i>, and</b> yet he must <b>go back and separate</b> <i>teruma</i> from another serpent melon or watermelon. No concern is expressed in this mishna that one might neglect to set aside <i>teruma</i> a second time. The Gemara answers: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> between the case of <b>an unwitting</b> sinner and that <b>of an intentional</b> sinner? There is a difference between them, as one who was <b>unwitting did not commit a transgression</b> and consequently does not deserve to be penalized, whereas one who was <b>an intentional</b> sinner <b>did commit a transgression.</b> |
| Terumot 3:3 | Rabbi Akiva, as we learned | Temurah 13a:2 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And there is no <i>teruma</i> after <i>teruma</i>.</b> Once one designates produce from his crop as <i>teruma</i>, if he then designates additional produce from that crop as <i>teruma</i>, it is not <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:3): In the case of <b>joint</b> owners of produce <b>who separated <i>teruma</i> one after the other, Rabbi Eliezer says: The <i>teruma</i> of both of them is <i>teruma</i>,</b> as each is considered to have separated from his share of the produce. |
| Terumot 3:4 | Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish | Kiddushin 59a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:4): In a case where someone appointed an agent to separate <i>teruma</i> from his produce on his behalf, and he subsequently <b>canceled</b> the agency, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the following: <b>If he canceled</b> the appointment <b>before</b> the agent <b>separated the <i>teruma</i>, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>. And here it is</b> a case involving one <b>statement and</b> a second <b>statement,</b> as the owner of the produce appointed the agent and rescinded his appointment by speech. This shows that <b>a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement.</b> Reish Lakish replied: <b>Giving money to a woman is different, as it is considered like an action, and</b> a mere <b>statement does not come and nullify</b> the <b>action</b> of the transfer of money. |
| Terumot 3:4 | Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish | Kiddushin 59b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from the aforementioned mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:4) with regard to one who appointed an agent to separate <i>teruma</i> on his behalf and subsequently <b>canceled</b> the agency: <b>If he canceled</b> the appointment <b>before</b> the agent <b>separated <i>teruma</i>, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> This shows that a statement nullifies a previous statement. <b>Rava says: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where the homeowner preceded</b> the agent <b>and separated <i>teruma</i></b> from <b>his heap</b> himself, <b>which is an action,</b> and an action certainly nullifies a statement. |
| Terumot 3:6 | And we learned | Temurah 5b:14 | The Gemara objects: But <b>isn’t there</b> the case of one who separated <b><i>teruma</i> prior to the</b> separation of the <b>first fruits,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses”</b> (Exodus 22:28)? The verse was expounded earlier (4b) as teaching that one must separate first fruits before separating <i>teruma</i>. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:6): If <b>one</b> separates <i>teruma</i> <b>prior</b> to the separation of the first fruits, <b>although he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done,</b> and produce has the status of <i>teruma</i>. This appears to refute the opinion of Rava. |
| Terumot 3:9 | as we learned | Gittin 23b:3 | <b>But</b> what of <b>a gentile and a Samaritan, who are</b> included <b>in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>teruma</i> with regard to their own</b> produce, i.e., they must designate a portion of it for the priest, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): With regard to <b>a gentile and a Samaritan that separated</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from their own</b> produce, <b>their <i>teruma</i> is considered <i>teruma</i>. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a different mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:1): In the case of <b>a gentile who separated <i>teruma</i> from a Jew’s</b> produce, i.e., acted as his agent, <b>even</b> if he did so <b>with permission</b> from the Jew, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Terumot 3:9 | at all; but a gentile, since he is included in his own teruma , as we learned | Kiddushin 41b:12 | The Gemara answers: It <b>was</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> for the case of <i>teruma</i>, because it cannot be derived from the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. This is as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> It is <b>a slave</b> who cannot serve as an agent to receive a bill of divorce, <b>since he cannot release</b> a woman by divorce <b>at all; but a gentile, since he is included in his own <i>teruma</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): <b>A gentile or a Samaritan who separated <i>teruma</i></b> from their own produce, <b>their <i>teruma</i> is considered <i>teruma</i>,</b> despite the fact that they are not obligated to do so, <b>I will say</b> that he can <b>also be</b> appointed as an <b>agent.</b> To counter this argument, the term “you also” <b>teaches us</b> that only members of the covenant can act as agents for separating <i>teruma</i>; gentiles cannot. |
| Terumot 3:9 | As we learned | Kiddushin 41b:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon, who exempts</b> one from paying an additional penalty for the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile, this explanation cannot be stated. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): If <b>the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile</b> gets mixed with regular produce, it is considered to be <b>a mixture of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>and non-sacred</b> produce, <b>and</b> if a non-priest eats this mixture unwittingly <b>he is liable</b> to pay <b>for it</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> beyond its value, just as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i>. <b>But Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him from paying the additional one-fifth, as he holds that the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile possesses no sanctity and is considered a mere gift to a priest. If so, if there is no need to learn the additional <i>halakha</i> that a gentile cannot act as an agent with regard to the separating of <i>teruma</i>, <b>why do I</b> need the derivation from <b>“you”</b> and <b>“you also”?</b> |
| Terumot 4:3 | of sixty? But didn’t we learn | Chullin 137b:8 | The Gemara asks: Is the amount one is required to separate as <b><i>teruma</i></b> one part <b>of sixty? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:3): With regard to the measure one should separate as <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> if one is of <b>generous disposition</b> he gives <b>one-fortieth.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law,</b> it is sufficient to give one part <b>of sixty; by rabbinic law</b> the requisite amount is one part <b>of forty.</b> |
| Terumot 4:4 | different from that which we learned | Bekhorot 61a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> manner <b>is</b> the case of animal tithe <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Go and separate</b> <i>teruma</i>, the agent <b>separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the intention of the homeowner.</b> He must separate the amount that he assumes the owner would want to give, as there is no fixed measure that one must set aside as <i>teruma</i>. A generous person gives as much as one-fortieth of his produce as <i>teruma</i>, while a stingy person can give one-sixtieth. |
| Terumot 4:4 | As we learned in a mishna | Ketubot 100a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> that case <b>different from this</b> case? <b>As we learned in a mishna</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go out and separate</b> <i>teruma</i>, the agent <b>separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the mind-set of the homeowner. And if he does not know the mind-set of homeowner, he separates an intermediate</b> measure, i.e., <b>one-fiftieth</b> of the produce. If <b>he subtracted ten</b> from the denominator and separated one-fortieth <b>or added ten</b> to the denominator and separated one-sixtieth of the produce, <b>his <i>teruma</i></b> is considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> If the agent is comparable to a widow, then why isn’t the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>teruma</i> that he has separated is nullified, since he did not act in accordance with the wishes of the homeowner? |
| Terumot 4:4 | As we learned | Ketubot 99b:12 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go out and separate</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>], the agent <b>separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the mind-set of the homeowner.</b> He must separate the amount that he assumes the owner would want to give, as there is no fixed fraction for the amount that one must set aside as <i>teruma</i>. A generous person would give as much as a fortieth of the produce as <i>teruma</i>, while a stingy person would give a sixtieth. <b>And if he does not know the mind-set of</b> the <b>homeowner, he separates an intermediate</b> measure, i.e., <b>one-fiftieth</b> of the produce. If <b>he subtracted ten</b> from the denominator and separated one-fortieth, <b>or added ten</b> to the denominator and separated one-sixtieth of the produce, <b>his <i>teruma</i></b> is considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Terumot 4:4 | that which we learned | Kiddushin 41a:12 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> there is <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go out</b> and <b>separate <i>teruma</i></b> from my field’s produce for me, the agent <b>must separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the mindset of the owner.</b> He must separate the amount that he assumes the owner would want to give, as there is no fixed measure for the amount that one must set aside as <i>teruma</i>. A generous person would give as much as one-fortieth of the produce as <i>teruma</i>, while a stingy person would give one-sixtieth. <b>And if he does not know the mindset of the owner, he separates an intermediate</b> measure, which is <b>one-fiftieth</b> of the produce. |
| Terumot 4:7 | as we learned | Avodah Zarah69a:2 | The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina thought</b> that the quantity of vinegar necessary for nullifying the flavor of the mouse should be <b>calculated at 101</b> times the volume of the mouse. <b>He said:</b> It should <b>not</b> be rendered <b>worse,</b> i.e., more stringent, <b>than <i>teruma</i>,</b> which is nullified by 101 times its volume in a mixture. This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:7): <b><i>Teruma</i> is nullified</b> in a mixture <b>by 101</b> times its volume of permitted food. <b>Rav Taḥlifa bar Giza said to Ravina: Perhaps</b> this case is <b>similar to spice of <i>teruma</i> in a pot, whose flavor is not nullified</b> even by 101 times its volume of permitted food, as the flavor imparted by spice is exceptionally strong. |
| Terumot 5:1 | As we learned | Nedarim 59a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> isn’t there the case of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> in <b>which if</b> he <b>wishes</b> he can <b>request</b> that a halakhic authority dissolve the designation of the produce as <i>teruma</i> <b>and</b> yet it is <b>nullified by a majority</b> of permitted items? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 5:1): <b>A <i>se’a</i> of ritually impure <i>teruma</i> that fell into less than one hundred</b> <i>se’a</i> of <b>non-sacred produce</b> must be left <b>to decay.</b> The impure <i>teruma</i>, which is forbidden to all, renders the entire mixture forbidden. The Gemara infers: If it fell <b>into one hundred</b> <i>se’a</i> of non-sacred produce, its prohibition <b>is neutralized.</b> The Sages of the Gemara <b>say</b> in response: <b>We are dealing with <i>teruma</i></b> that is <b>in the possession of a priest,</b> for <b>which</b> the owner <b>can no</b> longer <b>request</b> that a halakhic authority dissolve the designation. However, as long as the <i>teruma</i> is in the owner’s possession he can request that its designation be dissolved, and therefore its prohibition cannot be neutralized. |
| Terumot 5:6 | As we learned | Temurah 12a:10 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 5:6): If <b>a <i>se’a</i> of <i>teruma</i> fell into less than one hundred</b> <i>se’a</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> produce and thereby caused it to <b>become</b> a prohibited <b>mixture,</b> since the amount of <i>teruma</i> is too great to be nullified by the non-sacred produce, <b>and</b> a <i>se’a</i> <b>from the mixture</b> subsequently <b>fell into a different place</b> with non-sacred produce, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>se’a</i> from the original mixture <b>renders it</b> a prohibited <b>mixture as definite <i>teruma</i></b> would, in the same ratio, since I say: It is possible that the same <i>se’a</i> of <i>teruma</i> that fell into the first mixture was not mixed evenly throughout, and it all came out of it intact and fell into the second mixture. Therefore, it requires nullification as if it were unadulterated <i>teruma</i>. |
| Terumot 6:1 | and as we learned | Bava Metzia54b:3 | Rava continues: <b>With regard to <i>teruma</i></b> too, <b>it is written: “If a man eats that which is sacred unwittingly, then he shall add its one-fifth payment to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:14), <b>and as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 6:1): <b>One who partakes of <i>teruma</i> unwittingly pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> it concerns <b>one who partakes of</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>or one who drinks</b> it, <b>or one who applies</b> oil to himself; or <b>whether</b> it is <b>ritually pure <i>teruma</i> or ritually impure <i>teruma</i>. He pays its one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> if he partook of that one-fifth, he pays <b>one-fifth of its one-fifth.</b> Rava concludes: <b>While with regard to</b> second <b>tithe,</b> it <b>is neither written</b> in the Torah, <b>nor taught</b> in <b>a mishna, nor raised as a dilemma before us</b> by the <i>amora’im</i>. |
| Terumot 6:4 | Ravina said: We too learn | Bava Metzia54a:19 | <b>Ravina said: We too learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 6:4): <b>One who steals <i>teruma</i> and did not partake of it pays a payment of double</b> the principal at <b>the price of</b> the <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> as a thief pays double the value of the item that he stole. Both payments are calculated based on the price of <i>teruma</i>, which is lower than the price of non-sacred food, as the demand for it is lower because it is eaten only by priests. If the thief <b>ate it</b> unwittingly, <b>he pays</b> a payment worth the value of <b>two principals and</b> adds <b>one-fifth</b> in this manner: He pays one <b>principal and one-fifth from non-sacred</b> items, like any non-priest who partakes of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>the</b> other <b>principal,</b> he pays it according to <b>the price of <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Terumot 7:2 | reasoning, as it is taught | Keritot 6b:28 | <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: And</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda both <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 7:2): |
| Terumot 8:1 | Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned | Makkot 11b:14 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that these <i>amora’im</i>, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:1): If a priest <b>was standing and sacrificing</b> offerings <b>upon the altar, and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> and he was disqualified from the Temple service, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: All offerings that he sacrificed</b> up to that point are <b>not valid,</b> as it is apparent that he is not and never was fit for Temple service, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> all offerings that he already sacrificed as <b>valid.</b> |
| Terumot 8:2 | as we learned | Niddah 58b:18 | The statement that <b>its taste is like its</b> foul <b>smell</b> is applicable <b>with regard to the matter of</b> the partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:2): <b>Or if he tasted the taste of a bedbug in his mouth,</b> which is prohibited for consumption, <b>this</b> person <b>must spit out</b> the contents of his mouth, despite the fact that it is generally prohibited to waste <i>teruma</i>. <b>How does he know</b> that there is a bedbug in his mouth? He knows because <b>its taste is like its</b> foul <b>smell. And still, how does he know</b> the smell of a bedbug? In answer to this question the <i>baraita</i> explains that one does not err with regard to the smell of the bedbug, as <b>a covenant is made with it that anyone who squeezes it</b> will <b>smell its</b> foul odor, and therefore it is a well-known smell. |
| Terumot 8:4 | there | Chullin 10a:4 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:4): <b>Three liquids are forbidden due to exposure: Water, wine, and milk. How long shall they remain</b> exposed <b>and</b> their contents <b>will be forbidden?</b> It is a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary so <b>that a snake could emerge from a proximate place and drink. And how</b> far away is considered <b>a proximate place? Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> Even a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary <b>so that</b> a snake <b>could emerge from beneath the handle of the vessel and drink.</b> |
| Terumot 8:4 | we be concerned? First, as we learned | Chullin 49b:10 | The Gemara relates a similar episode: <b>Manyumin the jug maker</b> had <b>a jug [<i>bisteka</i>]</b> full <b>of honey</b> that <b>was</b> left <b>uncovered,</b> and he was concerned it might have been contaminated by snake venom. <b>He came before Rava</b> to inquire as to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rava said: With regard to what</b> need <b>we be concerned? First, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:4): <b>Three liquids are prohibited due to exposure: Wine, water, and milk; and all other liquids are permitted.</b> Honey, therefore, is permitted. <b>And furthermore, the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava:</b> But there is also the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that exposed honey is prohibited, <b>and</b> this dispute concerns a matter of <b>mortal danger, and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people?</b> |
| Terumot 8:8 | with regard to a barrel of teruma . As we learned | Bekhorot 33b:8 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar taught his son, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> who taught <b>his son:</b> Just <b>as</b> there is <b>a dispute here</b> in this <i>baraita</i> with regard to bloodletting, <b>so</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to a barrel of <i>teruma</i>. As we learned</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:8): In the case of <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i></b> oil <b>with regard to which uncertainty developed</b> concerning its status of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and which therefore may not be eaten, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that one must nevertheless safeguard the <i>teruma</i> from impurity. Therefore, <b>if</b> the barrel <b>was resting in a vulnerable location,</b> where it might come into contact with impurity, one <b>should place it in a concealed location, and if it was exposed, he should cover it.</b> |
| Terumot 8:9 | But didn’t we learn | Menachot 48a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>with regard to two</b> separate <b>matters</b> the court does <b>not say</b> that one should sin with regard to one in order to gain with regard to other? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:9): In the case of <b>a barrel of</b> wine that is <b><i>teruma</i> that broke in the upper</b> section of a <b>winepress, and in the lower</b> section of the winepress there is <b>non-sacred, impure</b> wine, and the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will flow into the lower press and become impure, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> both <b>concede that if one is able to rescue</b> even <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of</b> the wine that is <i>teruma</i> in a pure vessel so that it retains its <b>ritual purity, he</b> should <b>rescue</b> it, even if, in the process, the rest of the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will mix with the non-sacred wine. This will cause the owner a financial loss, because the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will become impure, causing the entire mixture to become prohibited for consumption. |
| Terumot 8:12 | Didn’t we learn | Chullin 111b:10 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: But let a gentile cook taste</b> the contents of the bowl to see whether they have the taste of blood. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:12): With regard to <b>a pot in which one cooked meat, one may not cook milk in it, and if he cooked</b> milk in it, the meat absorbed in the pot renders the milk forbidden if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the milk. Likewise, if one <b>cooked <i>teruma</i> in</b> the pot, <b>he may not cook non-sacred</b> food <b>in it, and if he cooked</b> non-sacred food in it, the non-sacred food is prohibited if there is sufficient <i>teruma</i> absorbed in the pot <b>to impart flavor</b> to the non-sacred food. |
| Terumot 9:4 | As we learned | Bava Metzia90a:4 | <b>And if you would say</b> that the contradiction between the ruling concerning <b>tithe</b> in one <i>baraita</i> <b>and</b> the ruling concerning <b>tithe</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> is <b>also not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> the ruling in this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> actual <b>tithe,</b> which may not be fed to a cow, and <b>there,</b> the ruling in that <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to growths of tithe,</b> which have the status of tithe by rabbinic law, and therefore it is permitted to feed them to one’s animal in order not to violate the prohibition against muzzling, this answer cannot be accepted. The reason is that <b>granted,</b> the <b>growths of <i>teruma</i></b> are considered like <b><i>teruma</i></b> by rabbinic law, <b>but</b> the <b>growths of tithe are non-sacred</b> foods. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 9:4): The <b>growths of untithed produce and</b> the <b>growths of second tithe</b> are <b>non-sacred.</b> |
| Terumot 10:2 | is that which we learned | Menachot 54a:2 | The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:2): In the case of <b>an apple</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>that one mashed and placed in</b> non-sacred <b>dough, and</b> the juice of the apple <b>leavened</b> the dough, <b>this</b> dough <b>is prohibited</b> to be consumed by anyone who may not partake of <i>teruma</i>. |
| Terumot 10:3 | tanna’im , | Avodah Zarah66b:5 | <b>Rav Mari said:</b> This dispute between Abaye and Rava is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:3): With regard to <b>one who detached a hot</b> loaf of <b>bread</b> from the oven <b>and placed it on the opening of a barrel of wine of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the bread <b>forbidden</b> to non-priests, as in his opinion the smell of the wine renders the bread forbidden to them, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>permitted. Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted in</b> a case of <b>wheat</b> bread <b>but deems</b> it <b>forbidden in</b> a case of <b>barley</b> bread, <b>because the barley draws out</b> the fumes of the wine. Rav Mari explains: <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> matter that the Sages in the mishna <b>disagree: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>a smell is</b> a substantial <b>matter, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a smell is nothing?</b> |
| Terumot 10:4 | as we learned | Avodah Zarah66b:4 | <b>Rava says: From where do I say that a smell is nothing?</b> It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:4): With regard to <b>an oven that one lit with cumin</b> stalks <b>of <i>teruma</i> and baked bread in it, the bread</b> is <b>permitted because</b> it has <b>not</b> absorbed <b>the flavor of</b> the <b>cumin</b> stalks <b>but</b> only <b>the smell of</b> the <b>cumin</b> stalks. This indicates that smell alone does not render a food forbidden. <b>And</b> how does <b>Abaye</b> explain this? He answers that <b>it is different there, as the forbidden substance was burned.</b> The smell of the forbidden cumin stalks entered the bread after the cumin stalks themselves were consumed by the fire, and a smell that is not from an extant substance is not forbidden. By contrast, in a case where the smell is from an extant source, it is forbidden. |
| Terumot 10:6 | supports him | Beitzah 13a:6 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the following mishna <b>supports him</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 10:6): With regard to <b>one who had bundles of fenugreek,</b> a type of legume, <b>of untithed produce, he may pound</b> these bundles to remove the seeds from them. <b>And he calculates how many seeds</b> the bundles <b>contain and separates <i>teruma</i></b> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>seeds, but</b> he <b>does not</b> calculate and <b>separate</b> <i>teruma</i> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>stalks.</b> Although the stalks and leaves are also used for cooking, it is not necessary to separate <i>teruma</i> from them. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: There,</b> with regard to stalks of grain, it is <b>not</b> yet ready to be tithed, and therefore not prohibited as <b>untithed produce,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> i.e., with regard to the bundles of fenugreek, it is ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <b>untithed produce?</b> |
| Terumot 10:8 | As we learned | Chullin 99b:6 | Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps leaven is different, because its leavening</b> properties are <b>potent,</b> and there are some forms of leaven that can have an effect on such a large quantity of dough. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: You reminded me</b> of <b>a matter that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Not all the measures are equal, because the measure</b> required in order to nullify non-kosher fish <b>brine</b> is <b>close to two hundred</b> times its volume. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:8): <b>The brine</b> of <b>a non-kosher fish is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda says: A quarter-</b><i>log</i> of non-kosher fish brine renders kosher food forbidden even if it is mixed <b>with two <i>se’a</i></b> of permitted food, which is one hundred ninety-two times as much as a quarter-<i>log</i>. |
| Terumot 10:11 | as we learned | Chullin 110b:6 | Rav Safra asked Abaye: <b>What is different</b> about the issue of the liver <b>rendering itself prohibited, that you did not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to this case? It is presumably because the answer is obvious to you, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:11) that liver <b>is not rendered prohibited</b> by its own cooking. But if so, <b>you should not raise the dilemma with regard to</b> whether it <b>renders the other</b> piece of meat <b>prohibited either, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>Liver renders</b> food cooked with it in the same pot <b>prohibited but is not prohibited</b> itself, <b>because</b> while it does <b>expel</b> blood as it cooks, it <b>does not absorb</b> this blood again, since the blood diffuses only outward. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: That mishna does not answer my question, as <b>perhaps there</b> it is referring specifically <b>to forbidden liver,</b> e.g., the liver of a non-kosher animal. |
| Terumot 11:2 | that which we learned | Chullin 120b:14 | §The Gemara elaborates on the comparison between <i>teruma</i> and first fruits with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the status of liquid that emerges from produce is like that of the produce itself, <b>and</b> it explains <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:2): If a non-priest ate <b>date honey, or apple wine, or vinegar</b> made <b>from grapes of autumn</b> that grow stunted at the end of the season and are unfit for wine production, <b>or</b> any of the <b>other types of</b> juice made from <b>fruits of <i>teruma</i>, Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>obligated</b> to repay <b>the principal and</b> an additional <b>fifth,</b> like the penalty for one who ate the <i>teruma</i> produce itself. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from payment. |
| Terumot 11:3 | that which we learned | Chullin 120b:18 | The Gemara cites <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:3): <b>One may bring beverages</b> made from <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple <b>only</b> in the case of <b>that which emerges from the olives,</b> i.e., oil, <b>or from the grapes,</b> i.e., wine. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is that mishna? |
| Terumot 11:3 | that which we learned | Chullin 120b:20 | The Gemara cites <b>that which we learned</b> in the same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:3): <b>One incurs the forty</b> lashes <b>due to</b> drinking the juice squeezed from <b><i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, <b>only for that which emerges from the olives or from the grapes.</b> The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is that mishna? |
| Terumot 11:8 | But didn’t we learn | Bava Batra87b:1 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:8): If one poured oil or wine of <i>teruma</i> from one vessel to another and <b>turned</b> the vessel on its side <b>and drained</b> out the last bits of liquid inside, <b>this is <i>teruma</i></b> and must be given to the priest? This indicates that the last remnants of the liquid in the vessel belong to the one who receives the oil or wine, not the owner, i.e., the seller. Why, then, does the mishna here teach that the last remnants belong to the seller? |
| Terumot 11:9 | But didn’t we learn | Avodah Zarah15a:8 | <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya,</b> also <b>objects to</b> the Gemara’s assumption that leasing confers ownership. <b>And</b> by <b>leasing</b> an item, <b>does one</b> actually <b>acquire</b> it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:9): <b>An Israelite who rented a cow from a priest may feed it vetches of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the animal belongs to a priest; <b>and</b> conversely, <b>a priest who rented a cow from an Israelite, although the responsibility to feed it is incumbent upon him, he may not feed it vetches of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as it does not belong to him. |
| Terumot 11:9 | But didn’t we learn | Yevamot 66b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And do they partake of <i>teruma</i> wherever he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for their</b> loss, even if they are not his actual possession? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:9): <b>An Israelite who rented a cow from a priest may feed it vetches [<i>karshinin</i>] of <i>teruma</i>,</b> since the animal belongs to a priest? With regard to <b>a priest who rented a cow from an Israelite, although</b> its feed <b>is</b> incumbent <b>upon him, he may not feed it vetches of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as it does not belong to him. This indicates that the requirement for enabling an acquisition to eat <i>teruma</i> is possession, not responsibility. |
