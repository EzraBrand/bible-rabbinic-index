| Beitza 4:7 | The Sages taught | Beitzah 39a:5 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Beitza</i> 4:7): <b>Five things were stated with regard to a coal,</b> in relation to the practical halakhic differences between a coal and a flame: <b>(1) Coal is as the feet of the owner</b> with regard to its Festival resting place, <b>whereas a flame</b> may be carried <b>anywhere. (2) One</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> property consecrated to the Temple <b>with a consecrated coal, whereas</b> with regard to <b>a flame,</b> according to rabbinic law <b>one may not benefit</b> from it, <b>but he is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> property consecrated to the Temple. <b>(3) Coal</b> used for <b>idol worship is prohibited</b> for one to benefit from it, <b>whereas</b> from <b>a flame</b> of this sort it <b>is permitted</b> to benefit. <b>(4) One who carries out a coal to the public domain is liable, whereas</b> one who carries out <b>a flame is exempt. (5) One who is prohibited by a vow</b> from deriving <b>benefit from another is prohibited from</b> using <b>his coal, but</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from his flame.</b> |
| Beitza 4:8 | raised a contradiction | Beitzah 39a:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava raised a contradiction to Rav Naḥman: We learned</b> in the mishna that the water of <b>a cistern of an individual is as the feet of the individual; and</b> Rava <b>raised a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Beitza</i> 4:8): Water drawn from <b>flowing rivers and flowing springs are as the feet of all people. Rava said: With what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? <b>With</b> cisterns that contain <b>collected</b> water, not flowing water. <b>And it was also said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna applies only <b>to collected</b> water. |
