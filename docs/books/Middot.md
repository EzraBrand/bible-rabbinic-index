| Middot 1:1 | But the mishna | Tamid 26a:6 | The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Yes, we have found</b> in this verse <b>that in general</b> the Torah <b>requires a watch</b> to be kept. Furthermore, the verse indicates that it is the <b>priests and Levites</b> who are required to perform the <b>watch,</b> as it states the precedent of Moses, who was a Levite, and Aaron, who was a priest. <b>But the mishna</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:1) <b>teaches: The priests</b> would <b>keep watch in three places in the Temple</b> courtyard…<b>and the Levites in twenty-one places.</b> According to the mishna, the priests and Levites kept watch in different locations, <b>whereas</b> in the <b>verse</b> the <b>priests and</b> the <b>Levites are written together,</b> indicating that they kept watch in the same places. |
| Middot 1:1 | elsewhere | Tamid 27a:2 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:1): <b>The priests</b> would <b>keep watch in three places in the Temple</b> courtyard: <b>In the Chamber of Avtinas, and in the Chamber of the Spark, and in the Chamber of the Hearth.</b> |
| Middot 1:2 | elsewhere | Tamid 27b:18 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:2): <b>The man [<i>ish</i>]</b> in charge of overseeing the watches <b>of the Temple Mount would circulate</b> nightly <b>among each and every watch post,</b> to ascertain that the watchmen were awake and performing their duty properly. <b>And</b> there were <b>lit torches</b> carried <b>before him,</b> so that the watchmen would see him approaching. <b>And</b> at <b>every watch post where</b> the watchman would <b>not stand</b> up, the man would test whether the watchman was sleeping; <b>and the man of the Temple Mount</b> would <b>say to him:</b> |
| Middot 1:3 | there | Menachot 98a:9 | § The Gemara discusses the depiction of Shushan the capital: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:3): One of the five gates of the Temple Mount was <b>the eastern gate upon</b> which <b>Shushan the capital</b> was <b>depicted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Shushan the capital was depicted on a gate of the Temple Mount? |
| Middot 1:4 | raises a contradiction | Tamid 27a:12 | <b>The Master said</b> above that <b>five</b> watches are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>five gates of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But was it</b> only <b>five gates that were</b> constructed <b>in the</b> walls of <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyard? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:4): <b>There were seven gates in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard: Three in the north, and three in the south, and one in the east.</b> |
| Middot 1:5 | as we learned | Tamid 26b:2 | The Gemara explains: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna that discusses the seven gates to the Temple courtyard (<i>Middot</i> 1:5): There were three gates <b>that were in the north,</b> and the first of these was the <b>Gate of the Spark.</b> It <b>was like a portico [<i>akhsadra</i>], and</b> there was <b>an upper story built atop it,</b> where the honor guard stood, <b>with the priests watching from above,</b> in the upper story; <b>and the Levites</b> would keep watch <b>from below. And</b> the hall <b>had an entrance toward the non-sacred</b> area of the Temple Mount. This mishna indicates that the Chamber of the Spark was an actual upper story. |
| Middot 1:6 | supports | Avodah Zarah52b:8 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion (<i>Middot</i> 1:6): The <b>northeast</b> chamber of the Chamber of the Hearth was the chamber <b>in which the Hasmoneans sequestered the altar stones that the people of Greece desecrated. And Rav Sheshet says:</b> This means <b>that</b> they <b>desecrated</b> the stones by using them <b>for idol worship.</b> This indicates that Temple vessels that were used in idolatrous worship can no longer be used and must be sequestered. |
| Middot 1:7 | raises a contradiction | Tamid 26b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>But was there</b> only <b>one watchman in the Chamber of the Hearth? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:7): <b>The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates; one,</b> on the north side, was <b>open to the rampart, and one,</b> on the south side, was <b>open to the courtyard. Rabbi Yehuda said: This</b> gate <b>that was open to the courtyard had a small wicket</b> in the door of the gate, <b>through which</b> the priests would <b>enter</b> in order <b>to examine the courtyard</b> and ensure that everything was in order. The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates, and therefore there should have been two watchmen there. <b>Abaye said: Since</b> the two gates <b>stood next to each other,</b> i.e., directly opposite one another, it <b>was sufficient for them</b> to be watched <b>by one watchman,</b> who could <b>look here and look there.</b> |
| Middot 2:5 | elsewhere | Menachot 85b:9 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 2:5) with regard to the wood logs that are burned on the altar: Priests inspect them before they are used and <b>any log in which a worm is found</b> is <b>unfit for</b> use <b>on the altar.</b> In reference to this mishna, <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a wet</b> log, as a wormy section cannot be removed. <b>But</b> if a wormy section is found in <b>a dry</b> log, the priest <b>scrapes</b> the wormy spot <b>away, and</b> the log is <b>fit</b> for use. |
| Middot 3:1 | hear | Bekhorot 17b:3 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:1): <b>A red line encircled</b> the altar <b>in the middle, to separate between the blood</b> that must be presented on <b>the upper</b> part of the altar <b>and the blood</b> that must be presented on <b>the lower</b> section of the altar. <b>And if you say</b> that it is <b>impossible</b> for two matters that are <b>in human hands to coincide precisely,</b> i.e., that people cannot measure the precise midpoint of an area, then that line will not be precisely in the middle, which means that there will be <b>times when</b> the priest <b>puts</b> blood meant for the <b>upper</b> part of the altar upon the <b>lower</b> section, <b>and</b> blood meant for the <b>lower</b> section <b>above.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: In <b>that</b> case, <b>one widens</b> the line <b>a little</b> so that it certainly covers the middle part of the altar. |
| Middot 3:1 | inset? But didn’t we learn | Menachot 97b:10 | The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> part of the altar <b>did you interpret</b> the verse to be referring? It is referring <b>to</b> the width by which each section of the altar is <b>inset. And can you interpret</b> the verse as referring <b>to</b> the width by which each section is <b>inset? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:1): The measurements of the base of the <b>altar were thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by thirty-two</b> cubits. Once the altar <b>rose</b> to the height of one <b>cubit</b> it was <b>inset</b> by one <b>cubit</b> on each side. <b>This</b> lower section <b>was</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar. One therefore <b>finds</b> that the second section of the altar measured <b>thirty</b> cubits <b>by thirty</b> cubits. |
| Middot 3:1 | And we learned | Menachot 97b:5 | Accordingly, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the height of the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>fifty-four</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths is the height of <b>half of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>twenty-seven</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths is the height <b>from</b> the top of the <b>corners</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge?</b> It is <b>twenty-four</b> handbreadths, four cubits of six handbreadths each. Therefore, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the surrounding ledge <b>short of half</b> the height <b>of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>three</b> handbreadths above the halfway mark. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:1): <b>A red line encircled</b> the altar <b>in the middle, in order to separate between the blood</b> that must be presented on the <b>upper</b> part of the altar and <b>the blood</b> that must be presented on the <b>lower</b> part of the altar. |
| Middot 3:8 | as it is taught | Tamid 29a:13 | The Gemara details the three instances with regard to which Shmuel states that the Sages employed exaggerated language: The case of the <b>circular heap</b> of ashes is <b>that which we stated</b> above. The case of the <b>vine</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:8): <b>A gold</b> ornament in the form of a <b>vine stood at the entrance to the Sanctuary, and</b> it <b>hung upon posts. And whoever would donate</b> an ornamental gold <b>leaf,</b> |
| Middot 4:7 | from here, | Bava Batra61a:3 | <b>Rav Yosef taught:</b> A small structure attached to a building <b>has three names</b> in the Bible: <b>Gallery [<i>yatzia</i>], side chamber [<i>tzela</i>],</b> and <b>cell [<i>ta</i>].</b> Such a structure is called <b>a gallery, as it is written: “The bottommost gallery [<i>hayyatzia</i>] was five cubits wide”</b> (I Kings 6:6). It is also called <b>a side chamber, as it is written: “And the side chambers [<i>vehatzelaot</i>] were one over another, thirty-three times”</b> (Ezekiel 41:6). Additionally, it is called <b>a cell, as it is written: “And the cell [<i>vehata</i>] was one reed long, and one reed wide; and the space between the cells was five cubits”</b> (Ezekiel 40:7). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it can be seen that a small structure attached to a building is called a cell <b>from here,</b> as was taught in the mishna (<i>Middot</i> 4:7): <b>The wall of the Sanctuary</b> was <b>six</b> cubits wide, <b>and the cell [<i>vehata</i>]</b> in back of it was <b>six</b> cubits wide, and <b>the wall of the cell</b> was <b>five</b> cubits wide. |
| Middot 5:1 | as we learned | Menachot 97b:18 | The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 5:1): The dimensions of <b>the entire Temple courtyard were a length of 187</b> cubits <b>by a width of 135</b> cubits. The length of the courtyard <b>from east to west</b> was <b>187</b> cubits, divided as follows: <b>The area</b> of the Israelite courtyard, <b>where</b> it was permitted for <b>Israelites to set their feet,</b> was <b>eleven cubits</b> long, <b>and the area where</b> it was permitted only for <b>the priests to set their feet</b> was <b>eleven cubits</b> long. <b>The altar</b> was <b>thirty-two</b> cubits long. The area designated as: <b>Between the Entrance Hall and the altar,</b> was <b>twenty-two cubits,</b> and <b>the Sanctuary</b> was <b>one hundred cubits</b> long. There was an additional <b>eleven cubits</b> of space <b>behind the Hall of the Ark Cover,</b> i.e., behind the Holy of Holies, which was at the western end of the Sanctuary. If the altar was actually only thirty-one cubits long, the mishna accounts for the length of only 186 cubits. |
