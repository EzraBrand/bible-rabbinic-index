| Makhshirin 1:5 | elsewhere | Keritot 15b:3 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 1:5): With regard to <b>one who</b> forcefully <b>wipes</b> rainwater from the surface of <b>a leek or squeezes out</b> water absorbed <b>in his hair or in his clothing, the liquid that</b> remains <b>within it is not</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put</b> upon the seed, and some of their carcass fall on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38). Therefore, it cannot render food susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. <b>But</b> the liquid <b>that is released from it,</b> in this process of wiping or squeezing, <b>is</b> included <b>under</b> the rubric of the verse: <b>“If</b> water <b>be put,”</b> and therefore it renders any food it touches susceptible to ritual impurity, as the person has accorded it significance. |
| Makhshirin 2:7 | But didn’t we learn | Ketubot 15a:17 | <b>Rav Yirmeya raised an objection</b> to the ruling of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, who apparently ruled that even in cases where there is one majority the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: <b>And in matters of lineage, do we not require two majorities,</b> a majority of the city’s inhabitants and a majority of the passing contingent? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 2:7): |
| Makhshirin 2:8 | hear | Bava Metzia24a:14 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 2:8): In a case when <b>one found a lost item in</b> a city where both Jews and gentiles reside, <b>if</b> the city has <b>a majority of Jews</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>If</b> there is <b>a majority of gentiles</b> he is <b>not obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>Who</b> is the one about <b>whom you heard that he follows the multitudes,</b> i.e., that he attaches significance to the loss of an item in a place where the multitudes are present? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. Resolve from</b> this mishna <b>that when Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that the item belongs to the finder, it is referring specifically to a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles, but</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews, no,</b> it does not belong to the finder. |
| Makhshirin 2:9 | hear | Chullin 95a:8 | The Gemara cites another challenge to the opinion of Rav: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 2:9): If one <b>found meat in</b> a city inhabited by both Jews and gentiles, <b>if</b> the meat <b>is raw, follow the majority of butchers,</b> so that if the majority of the butchers are Jewish, the meat is presumed to be kosher. <b>And if</b> the meat <b>is cooked, follow the majority of meat eaters,</b> because even if the majority of the butchers are Jewish, if the meat was cooked by a gentile it is forbidden. This mishna indicates that there are circumstances when the meat is permitted even though it was obscured from sight. |
| Makhshirin 4:3 | tanna’im , as we learned | Chullin 16a:7 | With regard <b>to the matter of rendering seeds susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:3): In the case of <b>one who places a bowl on the wall</b> while it is raining <b>so that</b> the bowl <b>will be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, if the water from the bowl then falls onto produce, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38). The water has the halakhic status of a liquid that he poured of his own volition on fruit and seeds. Consequently, it renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. But if he placed the bowl there <b>so that the wall will not be damaged, it is not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” Since he had no intent to use the water, it is not considered to have entered the bowl of his own volition, and it does not render produce susceptible to impurity. |
| Makhshirin 4:7 | from that which we learned | Chagigah 19a:6 | <b>Rather,</b> the proof that the purification with regard to non-sacred produce does not require intention is <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:7): In the verse that is referring to the preconditions required for fruit and seeds to be susceptible to ritual impurity, it is stated: “If water be put on seeds, and any of their carcasses fall there, it shall be impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). <b>If fruit fell into a water channel, and one whose hands were ritually impure extended his hands and lifted them up</b> with the goal of removing them from the water channel, <b>his hands are ritually pure,</b> as he has purified them by inserting them into the water channel, <b>and</b> these <b>fruits are not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>“if</b> water <b>be put</b> on seeds.” The verse is referring only to fruit that has intentionally been brought into contact with water. Since the fruit in this case was not intentionally made wet, it cannot as yet contract impurity. |
| Makhshirin 4:7 | as we learned | Chullin 31b:5 | The Gemara again asks: <b>But in any event, from where do we</b> derive <b>that non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:7): Produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was amenable to its dampening. This is derived from the verse: “But when water is placed on the seed, and some of their carcass shall fall on it, it is impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). If <b>produce fell into a stream, and one whose hands were ritually impure extended</b> his hands <b>and took</b> the produce from the water channel, <b>his hands are ritually pure</b> through immersion in the stream, <b>and</b> this <b>produce is not in</b> the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed.”</b> The produce is not susceptible to ritual impurity because the owner did not intend that his hands become wet. |
| Makhshirin 5:9 | We learned | Nazir 50a:12 | § The Gemara discusses a related issue. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 5:9): <b>Anything that is poured</b> remains <b>ritually pure.</b> In other words, if one pours liquid from one vessel into another, the stream of liquid is not considered to connect the two vessels. Consequently, if the upper vessel and its contents are pure, they do not become impure even if the lower vessel into which the liquid is poured is impure. The stream of liquid does not link them in this manner. |
| Makhshirin 5:9 | there | Sotah 48b:17 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 5:9): <b>Anything that is poured</b> remains <b>ritually pure.</b> In other words, even if a liquid is poured into a ritually impure utensil, the stream of the liquid does not defile the contents that remain in the ritually pure utensil from which they were poured, <b>apart from <i>zifim</i> honey and wafer</b> batter. These substances are too viscous to be considered liquids. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>zifim</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Honey</b> of such rare quality that <b>they</b> could <b>falsify [<i>mezayyefin</i>] it,</b> by diluting it with other substances, and it would not be noticed. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> It is named <b>after its place, as it is written: “Ziph and Telem and Bealoth”</b> (Joshua 15:24). |
| Makhshirin 6:1 | one time, as we learned | Chullin 13a:4 | Rabbi Ami asked: But with regard to <b>this</b> matter, <b>too, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>said</b> a conclusive resolution <b>one time, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:1): In the case of <b>one who takes his produce up to the roof</b> to protect it <b>from insects, and dew fell upon it,</b> the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was agreeable to its dampening. <b>And if</b> after taking the produce up to the roof <b>he intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” |
| Makhshirin 6:3 | elsewhere | Bekhorot 23b:6 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:3) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: Ritually pure brine,</b> taken from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>into which any amount</b> of <b>water fell</b> is rendered <b>impure. Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: That is to say</b> that <b><i>amei ha’aretz</i> are suspected of mixing half</b> a portion of water <b>in the brine,</b> which means that when the additional water falls in, the nullified impurity in the brine is revived by it and renders the entire mixture impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But why do I</b> need to say they are suspected of mixing precisely <b>half</b> a portion of water? <b>Even</b> if they mix in <b>less than half,</b> the brine will <b>also</b> be rendered impure upon contact with the added water, as <b>that</b> small <b>amount</b> combined with slightly less than half a portion of water <b>constitutes half</b> the mixture, <b>and half</b> a mixture <b>is not nullified</b> by the other half. |
| Makhshirin 6:5 | of Reish Lakish, as we learned | Chullin 114a:7 | § It was stated in the above <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who cooks</b> meat <b>in whey is exempt</b> from lashes. The Gemara comments: This ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, as we learned</b> in a mishna, with regard to liquids that render food susceptible to ritual impurity (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:5): The halakhic status of <b>whey is like</b> that of <b>milk,</b> which is one of the liquids that render food susceptible to impurity, <b>and</b> the halakhic status of olive <b>secretion is like</b> that of <b>oil,</b> which also renders food susceptible to impurity. With regard to this mishna, <b>Reish Lakish says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>rendering seeds,</b> i.e., produce, <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. <b>But with regard to cooking meat in milk,</b> the halakhic status of <b>whey is not like</b> that of <b>milk.</b> |
| Makhshirin 6:8 | As | Keritot 13a:17 | Rava elaborates: <b>As</b> a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:8) <b>teaches: A woman’s milk renders</b> food with which it comes into contact susceptible to <b>impurity, whether</b> it <b>emerges to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the infant <b>or not to</b> its <b>satisfaction.</b> By contrast, the milk of <b>an animal renders</b> food susceptible <b>to impurity only</b> if it emerges <b>to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the animal’s owner. |
