| Kinnim 1:1 | But isn’t it taught | Chullin 139a:15 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 1:1): <b>Which is</b> the case of <b>a vow</b> offering, <b>and which is</b> the case of <b>a gift</b> offering? <b>A vow</b> offering is where <b>one says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering. A gift</b> offering is where <b>one says: This</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering. And what is</b> the difference <b>between a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering? With regard to <b>a vow</b> offering, if <b>it died or was stolen or lost,</b> one <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b> With regard to <b>a gift</b> offering, if <b>it died or was stolen or lost,</b> one <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b> |
| Kinnim 2:1 | Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan | Nazir 12a:2 | <b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:1): With regard to an impure person who comes to undergo his purification process, and for this purpose set aside <b>an unspecified nest,</b> meaning a pair of turtledoves or pigeons, to use for his offerings. One is to be a burnt-offering and one is to be a sin-offering, and he had not yet specified which bird will be used for which offering. If <b>one fledgling of the</b> pair <b>flew away</b> and escaped <b>to the</b> open <b>air of the world, or</b> if it <b>flew among</b> birds invalidated for <b>sin-offerings that</b> have been left to <b>die, or if one of them died,</b> in each of these cases the owner of the nest <b>purchases a partner for the second,</b> i.e., remaining, bird. At that point he may decide which is for a sin-offering and which is for a burnt-offering. |
| Kinnim 2:5 | that which we learned | Kiddushin 13b:2 | § <b>They then sat and said</b> additional statements in the name of Rav Asi, one of which concerned <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin-offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs bring her burnt-offering</b> to fulfill her remaining sacrificial obligations. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the woman herself had already <b>separated,</b> i.e., designated, the animal for the burnt-offering <b>in her lifetime. But</b> if she <b>had not separated it in her lifetime, no,</b> the heirs are not required to bring a burnt-offering on her behalf. |
| Kinnim 2:5 | render fit, there are none among them that come after death. As we learned | Menachot 4b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> in response: <b>We find that the Torah differentiates between</b> those guilt offerings that <b>atone and</b> those that <b>render fit,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent with regard to those that render fit. Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: With regard to those guilt offerings that <b>atone, there are among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death,</b> i.e., they are sacrificed after the death of their owners, whereas with regard to those that <b>render fit, there are none among them that come after death. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs shall bring her burnt offering,</b>which comes to atone. If she set aside <b>her burnt offering and died, the heirs shall not bring her sin offering,</b> as it comes to render her fit to partake of offerings. |
| Kinnim 2:5 | as we learned | Zevachim 5a:3 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said to him: We have found</b> a precedent for this <b>in</b> the case of offerings <b>brought after</b> the <b>death</b> of their owners, <b>as they are fit, but they do not propitiate</b> God, as they do not have owners requiring atonement. This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin offering and</b> then <b>died,</b> the <b>heirs shall bring her burnt offering.</b> If she brought <b>her burnt offering and</b> then <b>died,</b> the <b>heirs shall not bring her sin offering.</b> Evidently, a burnt offering is sacrificed even if it does not satisfy its owner’s obligation. |
