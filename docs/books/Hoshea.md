| Hoshea 5:6 | as it is written: “With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the Lord, but they shall not find Him. He has removed [ ḥalatz ] Himself from them [ meihem ]” | Yevamot 102b:14 | Parenthetical to this discussion, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabban Gamliel:</b> You, the children of Israel, are <b>a nation whose Master removed [<i>ḥalatz</i>] Himself from them,</b> for God has left you in much the same way in which a <i>yavam</i> would perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i>, <b>as it is written: “With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the Lord, but they shall not find Him. He has removed [<i>ḥalatz</i>] Himself from them [<i>meihem</i>]”</b> (Hoshea 5:6). The heretic tried to use this verse as scriptural support that God has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the Jewish people. |
