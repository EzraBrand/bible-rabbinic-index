| Song of Songs 1:1 | Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs, | Shevuot 35b:16 | <b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Song of Songs 1:2 | to another matter, | Avodah Zarah35a:6 | § The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>diverted</b> Rabbi Yishmael’s attention <b>to another matter,</b> and began discussing the verse: “For your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the verse: <b>“For your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine”? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, the statements of Your beloved ones [<i>dodekha</i>],</b> i.e., the Sages, <b>are more pleasant to me than the wine of</b> the written <b>Torah</b> itself. |
| Song of Songs 1:2 | from the beginning of the verse: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” | Avodah Zarah35a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>this verse that</b> led Rabbi Yehoshua to <b>ask</b> Rabbi Yishmael a question specifically with regard to it? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said, and some say Rabbi Shimon bar Ami</b> said: He chose that verse because he sought to <b>tell him</b> a message that can be derived <b>from the beginning of the verse: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth”</b> (Song of Songs 1:2). In essence, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Yishmael, my brother, press your lips one to the other, and do not be so hasty to retort,</b> i.e., do not persist in your questioning. |
| Song of Songs 1:3 | teaches with regard to it: “Your ointments [ shemanekha ] have a goodly fragrance | Avodah Zarah29b:9 | Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him</b> that it should be read in the feminine: <b>For your love [<i>dodayikh</i>] is better</b> than wine. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: The matter is not so, as another</b> verse <b>teaches with regard to it: “Your ointments [<i>shemanekha</i>] have a goodly fragrance</b>... therefore do the maidens love you” (Song of Songs 1:3). This phrase, which appears in the next verse, must be describing a male, and therefore it can be deduced that the preceding verse is also in the masculine form. |
| Song of Songs 1:3 | which is written: “Your ointments have a goodly fragrance” | Avodah Zarah35b:7 | § <b>Rav Naḥman, son of Rav Ḥisda, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Your ointments have a goodly fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 1:3)? This is a metaphor for a Torah scholar: <b>To what is a Torah scholar comparable? To a flask of <i>pelaitin</i>:</b> When it is <b>exposed, its scent diffuses;</b> when it is <b>covered, its scent does not diffuse.</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:3 | hidden from him are revealed to him, as it is stated: “Maidens [ alamot ] love You” | Avodah Zarah35b:8 | The Gemara remarks: <b>And moreover,</b> when a Torah scholar spreads his knowledge, <b>matters that are</b> generally <b>hidden from him are revealed to him, as it is stated: “Maidens [<i>alamot</i>] love You”</b> (Song of Songs 1:3), and one may <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>The hidden [<i>alumot</i>]. And moreover, the Angel of Death loves him, as it is stated: “Maidens [<i>alamot</i>] love You,”</b> and one may <b>read into</b> the verse: The one appointed <b>over death [<i>al mot</i>]</b> loves you. <b>And moreover,</b> a Torah scholar <b>inherits two worlds: One</b> is <b>this world, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Maidens [<i>alamot</i>]</b> love You,” and one may <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>Worlds [<i>olamot</i>].</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:4 | Rabbi Akiva ascended in safety and descended safely. With regard to him, the verse states: “Draw me, we will run after you; | Chagigah 15b:16 | § The Gemara returns to the four who entered the orchard. It is stated above that <b>Rabbi Akiva ascended in safety and descended safely. With regard to him, the verse states: “Draw me, we will run after you;</b> the king has brought me into his chambers” (Song of Songs 1:4). The Gemara relates: <b>And even Rabbi Akiva, the ministering angels sought to push</b> him out of the orchard. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Leave this Elder, for he is fit to serve My glory.</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:8 | from between the hooves of horses in Akko. I recited this verse about her: “If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed your kids, | Ketubot 67a:2 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:8) with regard to the daughter of Nakdimon ben Guryon: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said</b> in the form of an oath: I pray that <b>I will</b> not <b>see the consolation</b> of the Jewish people <b>if I did not see her gathering barley</b> kernels <b>from between the hooves of horses in Akko. I recited this verse about her: “If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed your kids,</b> beside the shepherds’ tents” (Song of Songs 1:8). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“your kids [<i>gediyotayikh</i>]” but rather</b> read it as <b>your bodies [<i>geviyotayikh</i>].</b> This woman is compelled to follow the sheep to the pastures in order to sustain her own body from the leftovers of their food. |
| Song of Songs 1:12 | “While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance” | Gittin 36b:12 | <b>Rav Mari, son of Shmuel’s daughter, says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 1:12). He understands the verse in the following manner: While the king was still involved in his celebration, i.e., God had just given the Torah, the perfume of the Jewish people gave off an unpleasant odor, i.e., they sinned with the Golden Calf. <b>Rava says:</b> Nevertheless, it is apparent from the verse that <b>the affection</b> of God <b>is still upon us, as it is written</b> euphemistically as <b>“sent forth</b> its fragrance” <b>and</b> the verse <b>is not written: It reeked.</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:12 | “While the king was still at his table my spikenard | Shabbat 88b:2 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥamani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,</b> with one bead of your necklace” (Song of Songs 4:9)? <b>At first</b> when you, the Jewish people, merely accepted the Torah upon yourselves it was <b>with one of your eyes;</b> however, <b>when you</b> actually <b>perform</b> the mitzvot it will be <b>with both of your eyes. Ulla said</b> with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: <b>Insolent is the bride who is promiscuous under her wedding canopy. Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“While the king was still at his table my spikenard</b> gave off its fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:12). Its pleasant odor dissipated, leaving only an offensive odor. <b>Rav said:</b> Nevertheless, it is apparent from the verse that <b>the affection</b> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>is still upon us, as it is written</b> euphemistically as “<b>gave off</b> its fragrance,” <b>and</b> the verse <b>did not write, it reeked.</b> And <b>the Sages taught: About</b> those who <b>are insulted and do not insult, who hear their shame and do not respond, who act out of love and are joyful in suffering, the verse says: “And they that love Him are as the sun going forth in its might”</b> (Judges 5:31). |
| Song of Songs 1:13 | as it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts” | Menachot 98b:1 | The <i>baraita</i> explains: The staves of the Ark <b>pressed against the Curtain and bulged</b> outward. <b>And they appeared like two breasts of a woman</b> that are discernible through her clothes, <b>as it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13). Since the staves pressed against the Curtain, they were evidently placed from east to west. |
| Song of Songs 1:13 | which is written: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts” | Shabbat 88b:4 | And <b>that is</b> what <b>Rava said: To those who are right-handed in</b> their approach to Torah, and engage in its study with strength, good will, and sanctity, Torah is <b>a drug of life,</b> and <b>to those who are left-handed in</b> their approach to Torah, it is <b>a drug of death. Alternatively,</b> why are matters of Torah referred to as <b>royal?</b> Because <b>to each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, two crowns are tied. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13)? <b>The Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even though my beloved,</b> God, <b>causes me suffering and bitterness, He</b> still <b>lies between my breasts.</b> And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interpreted the verse: <b>“My beloved is to me like a cluster [<i>eshkol</i>] of henna [<i>hakofer</i>] in the vineyards of [<i>karmei</i>] Ein Gedi”</b> (Song of Songs 1:14). <b>He, Whom everything [<i>shehakol</i>] is His, forgives [<i>mekhapper</i>] me for the sin of the kid [<i>gedi</i>],</b> i.e., the calf, <b>that I collected [<i>shekaramti</i>] for myself.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> is it <b>inferred that</b> the word in <b>this</b> verse, <b><i>karmei</i>, is a term of gathering? Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said</b> that it is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A launderer’s chair upon which one gathers [<i>koremim</i>] the garments.</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:13 | As it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh, that lies between my breasts” | Yoma 54a:10 | <b>How</b> is this so? The staves of the Ark <b>pushed and protruded and stuck out against the curtain</b> toward the outside, <b>and appeared like the two breasts of a woman</b> pushing against her clothes. <b>As it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh, that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13). For this reason the Ark of the Covenant, where the Divine Presence rests, is positioned so that its staves protrude through the curtain, like the breasts of a woman. |
| Song of Songs 1:14 | “My beloved is to me like a cluster [ eshkol ] of henna [ hakofer ] in the vineyards of [ karmei ] Ein Gedi” | Shabbat 88b:4 | And <b>that is</b> what <b>Rava said: To those who are right-handed in</b> their approach to Torah, and engage in its study with strength, good will, and sanctity, Torah is <b>a drug of life,</b> and <b>to those who are left-handed in</b> their approach to Torah, it is <b>a drug of death. Alternatively,</b> why are matters of Torah referred to as <b>royal?</b> Because <b>to each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, two crowns are tied. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13)? <b>The Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even though my beloved,</b> God, <b>causes me suffering and bitterness, He</b> still <b>lies between my breasts.</b> And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interpreted the verse: <b>“My beloved is to me like a cluster [<i>eshkol</i>] of henna [<i>hakofer</i>] in the vineyards of [<i>karmei</i>] Ein Gedi”</b> (Song of Songs 1:14). <b>He, Whom everything [<i>shehakol</i>] is His, forgives [<i>mekhapper</i>] me for the sin of the kid [<i>gedi</i>],</b> i.e., the calf, <b>that I collected [<i>shekaramti</i>] for myself.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> is it <b>inferred that</b> the word in <b>this</b> verse, <b><i>karmei</i>, is a term of gathering? Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said</b> that it is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A launderer’s chair upon which one gathers [<i>koremim</i>] the garments.</b> |
| Song of Songs 1:17 | And with regard to this, Solomon said: “The beams of our houses are cedars, and our doors are cypresses [ berotim ]” | Yoma 38a:4 | <b>And with regard to this, Solomon said: “The beams of our houses are cedars, and our doors are cypresses [<i>berotim</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 1:17), and the Sages interpreted it homiletically: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>berotim</i> but</b> as <b><i>berit yam</i>,</b> covenant of the sea, meaning that the door forged a covenant with the sea for the sea to deliver it to its place. <b>Therefore,</b> when the nation prospered and the people replaced the doors made of various metals, the doors in <b>all the gates in the Temple were altered to become</b> doors of <b>gold except</b> the doors in <b>the Gates of Nicanor because miracles were performed to them. And some say</b> it was <b>because their copper was brightly-colored</b> and high quality. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says it was refined [<i>kelonita</i>] copper, and it illuminated</b> its surroundings <b>like gold.</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:3 | which is written: “As an apple tree among the trees of the wood, | Shabbat 88a:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar said: When the Jewish people accorded precedence</b> to the declaration <b>“We will do”</b> over <b>“We will hear,” a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: Who revealed to my children this secret that the ministering angels use? As it is written: “Bless the Lord, you angels of His, you mighty in strength, that fulfill His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word”</b> (Psalms 103:20). <b>At first,</b> the angels <b>fulfill</b> His word, <b>and then</b> afterward they <b>hearken. Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “As an apple tree among the trees of the wood,</b> so is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit and its fruit was sweet to my taste” (Song of Songs 2:3)? <b>Why were the Jewish people likened to an apple tree?</b> It is <b>to tell you that just as this apple</b> tree, <b>its fruit</b> grows <b>before its leaves, so too, the Jewish people accorded precedence to “We will do” over “We will hear.”</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:4 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, loves them, as it is stated: “And his banner [ vediglo ] over me is love” | Shabbat 63a:25 | <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Two</b> individual <b>Torah scholars who,</b> while studying together, <b>cause one another to err [<i>madgilim</i>] in <i>halakha</i></b> [<i>Tosafot</i>], nevertheless, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, loves them, as it is stated: “And his banner [<i>vediglo</i>] over me is love”</b> (Song of Songs 2:4). <b>Rava said: And that is</b> only true in a case <b>where they know the foundation of the law,</b> and their error resulted from the lack of more sophisticated knowledge. <b>And that is</b> only true in a case <b>where they do not have a prominent</b> person <b>in the city from whom</b> they could <b>learn</b> without error. |
| Song of Songs 2:5 | “Let me lean against the stout trunks; let me couch among the apple trees” | Beitzah 21a:3 | <b>When</b> Rav Avya <b>left, Rabba, son of</b> Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> his father: <b>Was this not Rav Avya the Elder, whom Master would recommend to</b> us, saying <b>that he is a great man?</b> If so, why did you treat him in that manner and evade his question? Rav Huna <b>said to him: What should I have done for him? Today I am</b> in a state best described by the verse: <b>“Let me lean against the stout trunks; let me couch among the apple trees”</b> (Song of Songs 2:5), meaning I am worn out and exhausted from all the communal responsibility that has fallen upon me, <b>and he asked me</b> about <b>something that requires reasoning</b> and careful examination, and therefore I could not provide an immediate answer. |
| Song of Songs 2:5 | “Let me lean against the stout trunks; | Chullin 124b:17 | <b>Rava, son of</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> his father: <b>But isn’t this Rav Avya the Elder of Pumbedita, whom the Master would praise to us,</b> saying <b>that he is a great man?</b> If so, why did you treat him in that manner and evade his question? Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to him: Today I am</b> in a state best described by the verse: <b>“Let me lean against the stout trunks;</b> let me couch among the apple trees” (Song of Songs 2:5), meaning: I am tired, <b>and he asked me</b> about <b>a matter that requires reasoning</b> and careful examination, and therefore I could not provide an immediate answer. |
| Song of Songs 2:7 | another verse is written: “I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field, | Ketubot 111a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rav Yehuda</b> respond to this argument? The verse is clearly referring to the Temple vessels, not to the people. The Gemara answers that <b>another verse is written: “I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field,</b> that you not awaken or stir up love, until it please” (Song of Songs 2:7). Rabbi Yehuda derived from here that no act of redemption should be performed until a time arrives when it pleases God to bring about the redemption. |
| Song of Songs 2:7 | written: “That you not awaken or stir up | Ketubot 111a:5 | <b>And</b> how does <b>Rav Yehuda</b> respond? It is <b>written: “That you not awaken or stir up</b> love” (Song of Songs 2:7), which serves to amplify and include a prohibition against Jews immigrating to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Song of Songs 2:7 | by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field” | Ketubot 111a:7 | § The Gemara discusses a phrase in the verse cited above. “I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, <b>by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field”</b> (Song of Songs 2:7). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people: If you fulfill the oath, it is good, and if not, I will abandon your flesh</b> and all will devour you <b>like the gazelles and like the hinds of the field.</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:8 | And it says: “The voice of my beloved; behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills” | Rosh Hashanah11a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the term <b><i>eitan</i> denotes mighty? As it is written: “Strong [<i>eitan</i>] is Your dwelling place,</b> and You put Your nest in a rock” (Numbers 24:21). <b>And it says: “Hear, O mountains, the Lord’s controversy, and you strong [<i>eitanim</i>] foundations of the earth”</b> (Micah 6:2), which is a call to the Patriarchs. <b>And it says: “The voice of my beloved; behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills”</b> (Song of Songs 2:8): <b>“Leaping upon the mountains”</b> means that the redemption will arrive early <b>in the merit of the Patriarchs,</b> who are called mountains, and <b>“skipping upon the hills”</b> means that it will come <b>in the merit of the Matriarchs.</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:12 | as it is stated: “The flowers appear on the earth; | Taanit 25b:9 | <b>Rabba said: I have seen this</b> angel in charge of water, <b>Ridya, in the form of a calf whose lips were parted, standing between the lower</b> waters of the <b>deep and the upper</b> waters of the <b>deep. To the upper</b> waters of the <b>deep, he said: Distill your water</b> and let it rain. <b>To the lower</b> waters of the <b>deep, he said: Let your water flow</b> from below, <b>as it is stated: “The flowers appear on the earth;</b> the time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove [<i>tur</i>] is heard in our land” (Song of Songs 2:12). The appearance of flowers in this verse alludes to the libations, as both the blooming of flowers and pouring of these libations are annual events. The time of the singing is referring to the singing of the Festival. Finally, the term <i>tur</i> in Aramaic can also mean an ox; in this context, it is interpreted as a reference to the angel Ridya. |
| Song of Songs 2:13 | as it is written: “The fig tree puts forth her green fruits [ fageha ]” | Niddah 47a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>an unripe fig [<i>paga</i>]</b> represents the stage when a woman <b>is still a child.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of the word <i>paga</i> is <b>as it is written: “The fig tree puts forth her green fruits [<i>fageha</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 2:13). The mishna further teaches that <b>a ripening fig [<i>boḥal</i>]</b> represents <b>the days of her young womanhood.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of this word is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:2): The obligation of tithes applies to <b>the figs from when they begin to ripen [<i>misheyyibaḥalu</i>]; and Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that this means <b>from when the heads</b> of the figs <b>whiten.</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:14 | as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring” | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1). |
| Song of Songs 2:14 | said: A deep voice in a woman, this is a blemish, as it is stated: “For your voice is sweet and your appearance pleasant” | Ketubot 75a:12 | <b>Rav Ḥisda said: I heard this matter from a great man, and who was</b> this great man? <b>Rabbi Sheila</b> was the great man. He said: If <b>a dog bit</b> a woman, <b>and the place</b> of the wound <b>developed into a scar, this is a blemish. Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>said: A deep voice in a woman, this is a blemish, as it is stated: “For your voice is sweet and your appearance pleasant”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). <b>Rabbi Natan Bira’a taught: A handbreadth between a woman’s breasts.</b> The <i>amora’im</i> have a dispute concerning the meaning of Rabbi Natan Bira’a’s statement: <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, thought to say before Rav Ashi</b> that this means <b>a handbreadth</b> between a woman’s breasts <b>is perfection</b> and considered beautiful. <b>Rav Ashi said to him:</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught with regard to blemishes,</b> and it means that if her breasts are separated by a gap this wide, it is a blemish. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of a gap is considered normal? <b>Abaye said:</b> The width of <b>three fingers.</b> |
| Song of Songs 2:14 | “For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is beautiful” | Niddah 31b:16 | The students continued to ask Rabbi Dostai: <b>For what</b> reason <b>is a woman’s voice pleasant, but a man’s voice is not pleasant?</b> He answered: <b>This</b> man is similar to <b>the place from which he was created,</b> the earth, which does not issue a sound when it is struck, <b>and that</b> woman is similar to <b>the place from which she was created,</b> a bone, which makes a sound when it is struck. The proof that a woman’s voice is pleasant is <b>that it is stated</b> in Song of Songs that the man says to his beloved: <b>“For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is beautiful”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). |
| Song of Songs 2:15 | would cry together, as it is written: “Take us the foxes, the little foxes, | Sotah 12a:19 | The next verse states: <b>“And when she could no longer hide him”</b> (Exodus 2:3). The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> couldn’t she hide him any longer? <b>Let her continue to hide him. Rather, anywhere that the Egyptians heard that a baby was born</b> and they wanted to locate the baby, <b>they would bring</b> another <b>baby there in order that it could be heard</b> crying, <b>and</b> the two babies <b>would cry together, as it is written: “Take us the foxes, the little foxes,</b> that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom” (Song of Songs 2:15). The infants who were used to uncover the hidden babies are referred to as little foxes. |
| Song of Songs 3:5 | “I adjure you” | Ketubot 111a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Zeira</b> maintains that the oath mentioned in <b>that</b> verse means <b>that the Jews should not ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>as a wall,</b> i.e., en masse, whereas individuals may immigrate as they wish. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav Yehuda</b> reply to this? The Gemara answers that this command is derived from <b>another</b> verse in which <b>“I adjure you”</b> (Song of Songs 3:5) is <b>written</b>. |
| Song of Songs 3:7 | And ultimately, he ruled over only his bed, as it is stated: “Behold, it is the bed of Solomon; | Sanhedrin 20b:17 | Reish Lakish continues: <b>And ultimately,</b> Solomon declined further still in that <b>he ruled only over Israel, as it is stated: “I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel</b> in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only Jerusalem, as it is stated: “The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:1). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only his bed, as it is stated: “Behold, it is the bed of Solomon;</b> threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Song of Songs 3:7 | too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty | Shevuot 35b:16 | <b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Song of Songs 3:10 | the daughter of the son of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the ceiling [ saraf refidat ] of the House of God, as it is written: “Its top [ refidato ] of gold” | Megillah 10b:22 | The verse continues: “And <b>instead of the nettle [<i>sirpad</i>],”</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Vashti.</b> Why is she called a nettle [<i>sirpad</i>]? Because she was <b>the daughter of the son of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the ceiling [<i>saraf refidat</i>] of the House of God, as it is written: “Its top [<i>refidato</i>] of gold”</b> (Song of Songs 3:10). |
| Song of Songs 3:11 | “Go forth, daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon, upon the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the gladness of his heart” | Taanit 26b:6 | <b>And similarly, it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Go forth, daughters of Zion, and gaze upon King Solomon, upon the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the gladness of his heart”</b> (Song of Songs 3:11). This verse is explained as an allusion to special days: <b>“On the day of his wedding”; this is the giving of the Torah</b> through the second set of tablets on Yom Kippur. The name King Solomon in this context, which also means king of peace, is interpreted as a reference to God. <b>“And on the day of the gladness of his heart”; this is the building of the Temple, may it be rebuilt speedily in our days.</b> |
| Song of Songs 4:1 | as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats, | Berakhot 24a:17 | Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1). |
| Song of Songs 4:3 | “Your temples are like a split pomegranate” | Berakhot 57a:7 | <b>One who sees a fig tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof”</b> (Proverbs 27:18). <b>One who sees pomegranates in a dream,</b> if they were <b>small, his business will flourish like the seeds of</b> the <b>pomegranate,</b> which are numerous; and if they were <b>large, his business will increase like a pomegranate.</b> One who saw <b>slices of pomegranates</b> in his dream, <b>if he is a Torah scholar, he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 8:2), which is traditionally understood as an allusion to Torah. <b>And if</b> the dreamer <b>is an ignoramus, he should anticipate mitzvot,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Your temples are like a split pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3). As the Gemara previously interpreted homiletically: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>“Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>]”? Even the most ignorant [<i>reikanin</i>] among you,</b> Israel, <b>are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate.</b> |
| Song of Songs 4:3 | as it is written: “Your temples [ rakatekh ] are like a pomegranate split open” | Chagigah 27a:8 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The <b>fire of Gehenna has no power over the sinners of Israel</b> either. This can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the golden altar: If the golden altar, which</b> has <b>on it</b> a coating that is <b>no more than the thickness of a gold dinar,</b> and which has incense burning on it <b>for many years</b> and yet <b>fire has no power over it,</b> as the gold miraculously remained undamaged, <b>all the more so</b> should immunity from fire be granted to <b>the sinners of Israel, who are filled with good deeds as a pomegranate</b> is full of seeds, <b>as it is written: “Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>] are like a pomegranate split open”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3), which is to be expounded as follows: <b>Do not read</b> this word as <b><i>rakatekh</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>reikanin shebakh</i>,</b> meaning the empty, worthless people among you; even these people are as full of good deeds as a pomegranate is full of seeds. |
| Song of Songs 4:4 | this? “Your neck is like the Tower of David, built with turrets [ talpiyyot ], | Berakhot 30a:10 | An allusion to this is found in what <b>Rabbi Avin, and some say Rabbi Avina, said: What verse</b> alludes to <b>this? “Your neck is like the Tower of David, built with turrets [<i>talpiyyot</i>],</b> one thousand shields hang from it, all of the armor of the mighty” (Song of Songs 4:4). He interprets the word <i>talpiyyot</i> as the <b>hill</b> [<b><i>tel</i>] toward which all mouths</b> [<b><i>piyyot</i>] turn,</b> i.e., the Temple Mount. |
| Song of Songs 4:7 | “You are all fair, my love; and there is no blemish in you” | Kiddushin 76b:5 | The mishna also taught: <b>Nor</b> must one investigate <b>from the Sanhedrin and above. What is the reason</b> there is no need to investigate further? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>just as the court is clean in justice, so too, it is clean of any blemish,</b> i.e., it does not include anyone of flawed lineage. <b>Mareimar said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? It states: <b>“You are all fair, my love; and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7). |
| Song of Songs 4:7 | “You are all fair, my love; and there is no blemish in you” | Sanhedrin 36b:9 | § The mishna teaches: <b>But not all are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>capital law;</b> the judges may be only priests, Levites, or Israelites who are of sufficiently fit lineage to marry their daughters to members of the priesthood. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Yosef taught: Just as the court is clean in justice, so too, it is clean of any blemish,</b> i.e., it does not include anyone of flawed lineage. <b>Ameimar says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? It states: <b>“You are all fair, my love; and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7). |
| Song of Songs 4:7 | as it is stated: “You are entirely beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you” | Yevamot 101b:1 | This is <b>as it is stated: “You are entirely beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7). If the Elders conducting <i>ḥalitza</i> needed to be expert judges, there would be no reason to explicitly exclude the blind, as they are unfit to be judges in a regular court. Evidently it is permitted for laymen to be judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>, and only blind individuals are excluded. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse <b>“before the eyes of”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes for</b> that which <b>Rava</b> taught, <b>as Rava said: The judges must see the spittle that exits from the mouth of the <i>yevama</i></b> as part of the ceremony of <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is written:</b> “His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, <b>before the eyes of the Elders,</b> and remove his shoe from on his foot <b>and spit</b> before him and respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Song of Songs 4:9 | levuvin is a term of closeness? As it is written: “You have drawn me near [ libavtini ], my sister my bride” | Shabbat 53b:21 | We learned in our mishna: <b>Rams may go out <i>levuvin</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>levuvin</i>? Rav Huna said: Tied [<i>tutri</i>]</b> in pairs. The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>levuvin</i> is a term of closeness? As it is written: “You have drawn me near [<i>libavtini</i>], my sister my bride”</b> (Song of Songs 4:9). |
| Song of Songs 4:9 | which is written: “You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, | Shabbat 88b:2 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥamani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,</b> with one bead of your necklace” (Song of Songs 4:9)? <b>At first</b> when you, the Jewish people, merely accepted the Torah upon yourselves it was <b>with one of your eyes;</b> however, <b>when you</b> actually <b>perform</b> the mitzvot it will be <b>with both of your eyes. Ulla said</b> with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: <b>Insolent is the bride who is promiscuous under her wedding canopy. Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“While the king was still at his table my spikenard</b> gave off its fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:12). Its pleasant odor dissipated, leaving only an offensive odor. <b>Rav said:</b> Nevertheless, it is apparent from the verse that <b>the affection</b> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>is still upon us, as it is written</b> euphemistically as “<b>gave off</b> its fragrance,” <b>and</b> the verse <b>did not write, it reeked.</b> And <b>the Sages taught: About</b> those who <b>are insulted and do not insult, who hear their shame and do not respond, who act out of love and are joyful in suffering, the verse says: “And they that love Him are as the sun going forth in its might”</b> (Judges 5:31). |
| Song of Songs 4:11 | “Honey and milk are under your tongue” | Chagigah 13a:8 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef would study the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> and was familiar with the subject, whereas <b>the Elders of Pumbedita would study the act of Creation. They said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Let the Master teach us the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot. He said to them:</b> You <b>teach me the act of Creation. After they taught him</b> that subject, <b>they said to him: Let the Master teach us the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot. He said to them: We learned with regard to them</b> the secrets of the Torah: <b>“Honey and milk are under your tongue”</b> (Song of Songs 4:11), meaning that <b>matters that are sweeter than honey and milk should remain under your tongue.</b> In other words, one should not speak of such matters, and anyone who is familiar with them may not reveal them to others. |
| Song of Songs 4:12 | “A garden enclosed is my sister the bride; | Yoma 75a:8 | The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that they cried over actual <b>fish but</b> were <b>not promiscuous</b> in having <b>forbidden relations</b> in Egypt, <b>this is what is written</b> to praise the Jewish people: <b>“A garden enclosed is my sister the bride;</b> a locked fountain, a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12). This figurative language teaches that Jewish women are chaste. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> the Jewish people cried over <b>forbidden sexual relations, what</b> does the phrase <b>“a sealed spring”</b> mean? The Gemara answers: It means that they were <b>not promiscuous</b> with <b>those</b> relatives <b>who were</b> already <b>forbidden</b> to them. In Egypt, the Jewish people observed the laws of forbidden sexual relations that are included in the seven Noahide commandments. In the desert, they cried over the additional prohibitions imposed when the Torah was given. |
| Song of Songs 4:13 | as it is stated: “Your shoots [ shelaḥayikh ] are an orchard of pomegranates” | Bava Batra68a:9 | The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i></b> is irrigated <b>fields?</b> This is <b>not</b> the case. Rather, <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i>?</b> This is referring to <b>gardens</b> found within the city, <b>as it is stated: “Your shoots [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are an orchard of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13). <b>But the fields</b> that surround the city <b>are not sold. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say</b> that <b>even</b> the <b>fields are sold as well.</b> This is one version of the discussion. |
| Song of Songs 4:13 | As it is written: “Your tresses [ shelaḥayikh ] are a park of pomegranates” | Nazir 3a:7 | The mishna rules that with regard to one who says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to grow [<i>leshale’aḥ</i>] long hair, he is a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term <b><i>shilu’aḥ</i>,</b> which is a different form of the word <i>leshale’aḥ</i>, <b>is</b> an expression of <b>increase</b> and growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Your tresses [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are a park of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13). |
| Song of Songs 4:13 | “Your shoots [ shelaḥayikh ] are an orchard of pomegranates” | Niddah 19b:11 | <b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Meir <b>was saying to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> that green blood renders food susceptible to ritual impurity <b>from</b> the following <b>verbal analogy: It is written here,</b> in a description of the beloved woman that alludes to her menstrual blood: <b>“Your shoots [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are an orchard of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13), <b>and it is written there:</b> “Who gives rain upon the earth, <b>and sends [<i>veshole’aḥ</i>] waters upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10). This verbal analogy indicates that menstrual blood is similar to water in that both render food susceptible to ritual impurity. |
| Song of Songs 4:15 | rise early and recite: “A well of living waters” | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Song of Songs 4:16 | As it is written: “Awake [ uri ], O north; and come, south… | Zevachim 116a:15 | <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>they did not sacrifice</b> peace offerings? <b>As it is written: “Awake [<i>uri</i>], O north; and come, south…</b>Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits” (Song of Songs 4:16). The Gemara interprets this homiletically: The <b>nation,</b> i.e., the nations of the world, who are the descendants of Noah, <b>whose acts,</b> i.e., sacrifices, are only <b>in the north,</b> i.e., they sacrifice only burnt offerings, which are slaughtered and their blood collected in the north of the Temple courtyard, <b>shall be removed [<i>titna’er</i>], and</b> in its place <b>shall come</b> the Jewish <b>nation, whose acts,</b> i.e., sacrifices, are <b>in the north and in the south,</b> as they sacrifice burnt offerings, whose rites are performed in the north, and peace offerings, whose rites may also be performed in the south, as the entire courtyard is fit for their rites. |
| Song of Songs 5:6 | as it is stated: “My soul departed when he spoke” | Shabbat 88b:6 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> From <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the souls of the Jewish people left</b> their bodies, <b>as it is stated: “My soul departed when he spoke”</b> (Song of Songs 5:6). <b>And since their souls left</b> their bodies <b>from the first utterance, how did they receive the second utterance?</b> Rather, God <b>rained the dew</b> upon them <b>that, in the future, will revive the dead, and He revived them, as it is stated: “You, God, poured down a bountiful rain; when Your inheritance was weary You sustained it”</b> (Psalms 68:10). <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> With <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the Jewish people retreated</b> in fear <b>twelve <i>mil</i>, and the ministering angels walked them</b> back toward the mountain, <b>as it is stated: “The hosts of angels will scatter [<i>yidodun</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:13). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>yidodun</i>,</b> meaning scattered; <b>rather,</b> read it as <b><i>yedadun</i>,</b> they walked them. |
| Song of Songs 5:10 | “Preeminent above a myriad” | Chagigah 16a:2 | <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Rabbi Akiva expounded the verse: <b>“Preeminent above a myriad”</b> (Song of Songs 5:10) to indicate that <b>He is exemplary among His myriad.</b> |
| Song of Songs 5:11 | and it is written: “His locks are curled, black as a raven” | Chagigah 14a:4 | § The Gemara continues to reconcile verses that seem to contradict each other: <b>One verse states: “His raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure</b> white <b>wool”</b> (Daniel 7:9), <b>and it is written: “His locks are curled, black as a raven”</b> (Song of Songs 5:11). The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> the verse in Daniel is referring to when He is <b>in the</b> heavenly <b>academy,</b> while <b>there</b> the verse in Song of Songs speaks of when He is <b>at war, for the Master said: There is no finer</b> individual to study Torah <b>in an academy than an old man, and there is no finer</b> individual to wage war <b>than a youth.</b> A different metaphor is therefore used to describe God on each occasion. |
| Song of Songs 5:11 | states: “His locks are curled, and black as a crow” | Chullin 63a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>The Master said:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow. Is that to say</b> that the particular crow <b>stands before us,</b> such that one immediately knows which one it is? <b>Rather, say:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the black crow, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “His locks are curled, and black as a crow”</b> (Song of Songs 5:11). The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The valley</b> crow <b>[<i>ha’amaki</i>]</b> is the <b>white</b> crow. <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to leprosy: <b>“If the appearance thereof be deeper [<i>amok</i>] than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), and the Sages explained: <b>As the appearance of</b> an area lit by the <b>sun, which</b> seems <b>deeper than the shade,</b> which appears to cover it. There is therefore an association between a valley and the color white. |
| Song of Songs 5:11 | his locks [ kevutzotav ] are wavy [ taltalim ], | Eruvin 21b:24 | With regard to the verse, “His head is as the most fine gold, <b>his locks [<i>kevutzotav</i>] are wavy [<i>taltalim</i>],</b> and black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said:</b> This <b>teaches that it is possible to expound from each and every stroke [<i>kotz</i>]</b> of the letters in the Torah <b>mounds upon mounds [<i>tilei tilim</i>] of laws.</b> |
| Song of Songs 5:11 | over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shines his brightness in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: | Sanhedrin 100a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Simon, taught:</b> For <b>anyone who blackens his face</b> while toiling <b>over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shines his brightness in the World-to-Come, as it is stated:</b> “His locks are curly black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), and thereafter it is written: <b>“His countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars”</b> (Song of Songs 5:15), followed by: “His palate is like sweets” (Song of Songs 5:16). One who engages in sweets, i.e., Torah study, in this world, until he is blackened, black as a raven, is privileged to shining brightness in the World-to-Come. |
| Song of Songs 5:13 | that which is written: “His cheeks are like a bed of spices” | Eruvin 54a:17 | <b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “His cheeks are like a bed of spices”</b> (Song of Songs 5:13)? <b>If a person makes himself</b> humble <b>like this</b> garden <b>bed upon which everyone treads, and like this spice with which everyone perfumes himself,</b> i.e., which benefits not only the one who wears it, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not, his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b> |
| Song of Songs 5:13 | shall be burned, as it is stated: “His lips are as lilies [ shoshanim ] dripping with flowing myrrh [ notefot mor over ]” | Pesachim 117a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that one should introduce matters of <i>halakha</i> joyfully? <b>Didn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav said: Any Torah scholar who sits before his teacher and his lips are not dripping with bitterness</b> due to fear of his teacher, those lips <b>shall be burned, as it is stated: “His lips are as lilies [<i>shoshanim</i>] dripping with flowing myrrh [<i>notefot mor over</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 5:13). He interpreted homiletically: <b>Do not read it</b> as <b><i>shoshanim</i>, lilies; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>sheshonim</i>, who are studying.</b> Likewise, <b>do not read it</b> as <b><i>mor over</i>, flowing myrrh; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>mar over</i>, flowing bitterness.</b> In other words, lips that are studying Torah must be full of bitterness. |
| Song of Songs 5:13 | it is stated: “His lips are as lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh [ shoshanim notefot mor over ]” | Shabbat 30b:6 | The Gemara asks: Is <b>that so,</b> that one should introduce matters of <i>halakha</i> joyfully? <b>Didn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav said: Any Torah scholar who sits before his teacher and his lips are not dripping with myrrh</b> due to fear of his teacher, those lips <b>shall be burnt,</b> as <b>it is stated: “His lips are as lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh [<i>shoshanim notefot mor over</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 5:13)? He interpreted homiletically: <b>Do not read <i>mor over</i>, flowing myrrh; rather,</b> read <b><i>mar over</i>, flowing bitterness.</b> Likewise, <b>do not read <i>shoshanim</i>, lilies; rather,</b> read <b><i>sheshonim</i>, that are studying,</b> meaning that lips that are studying Torah must be full of bitterness. The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult,</b> there is no contradiction here, as <b>this,</b> where it was taught that one should introduce matters of <i>halakha</i> joyfully, is referring <b>to a rabbi, and that,</b> where it was taught that one must be filled with bitterness, is referring <b>to a student,</b> who must listen to his teacher with trepidation. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this and that</b> are referring <b>to a rabbi, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. This,</b> where it was taught that he must be joyful, is <b>before</b> he <b>begins</b> teaching, whereas <b>that,</b> where it was taught that he must be filled with bitterness and trepidation, is <b>after</b> he already <b>began</b> teaching <i>halakha</i>. That explanation is <b>like that which Rabba</b> did. <b>Before he began</b> teaching <i>halakha</i> <b>to the Sages, he would say something humorous and the Sages would be cheered. Ultimately, he sat in trepidation and began</b> teaching the <i>halakha</i>. |
| Song of Songs 5:13 | which is written: “His cheeks are as a bed of spices, | Shabbat 88b:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “His cheeks are as a bed of spices,</b> as banks of sweet herbs, his lips are lilies dripping with flowing myrrh” (Song of Songs 5:13)? It is interpreted homiletically: From <b>each and every utterance that emerged from</b> His cheeks, i.e., <b>the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the entire world was filled with fragrant spices. And since</b> the world <b>was</b> already <b>filled by the first utterance, where</b> was there room for the spices of <b>the second utterance</b> to <b>go? The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought forth wind from His treasuries and made the</b> spices <b>pass one at a time,</b> leaving room for the consequences of the next utterance. <b>As it is stated: “His lips are lilies [<i>shoshanim</i>] dripping with flowing myrrh.”</b> Each and every utterance resulted in flowing myrrh. <b>Do not read</b> the word in the verse as <b><i>shoshanim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>sheshonim</i>,</b> meaning repeat. Each repeat utterance produced its own fragrance. |
| Song of Songs 5:15 | “His countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars” | Sanhedrin 100a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Simon, taught:</b> For <b>anyone who blackens his face</b> while toiling <b>over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shines his brightness in the World-to-Come, as it is stated:</b> “His locks are curly black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), and thereafter it is written: <b>“His countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars”</b> (Song of Songs 5:15), followed by: “His palate is like sweets” (Song of Songs 5:16). One who engages in sweets, i.e., Torah study, in this world, until he is blackened, black as a raven, is privileged to shining brightness in the World-to-Come. |
| Song of Songs 6:7 | the sinners of the Jewish people, who are filled with good deeds like a pomegranate, as it is stated: “Your temples [ rakatekh ] are like a split pomegranate | Eruvin 19a:9 | <b>If the golden altar</b> in the Temple, <b>which was only covered by</b> gold <b>the thickness of a golden dinar, stood for many years and the fire did not burn it,</b> for its gold did not melt, so too <b>the sinners of the Jewish people, who are filled with good deeds like a pomegranate, as it is stated: “Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>] are like a split pomegranate</b> behind your veil” (Song of Songs 6:7), will not be affected by the fire of Gehenna. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> about this: <b>Do not read: Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>], but</b> rather: <b>Your empty ones [<i>reikateikh</i>],</b> meaning that <b>even the sinners among you are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate; how much more so</b> should the fire of Gehenna have no power over them. |
| Song of Songs 6:7 | from here: “Your temples [ rakkatekh ] are like a pomegranate split open” | Sanhedrin 37a:7 | <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that the source to rely on them not to transgress is <b>from here: “Your temples [<i>rakkatekh</i>] are like a pomegranate split open”</b> (Song of Songs 6:7), which teaches that <b>even the empty</b> people <b>[<i>reikanin</i>] among you are</b> as <b>full of mitzvot as the pomegranate</b> is full of seeds. <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that the source is <b>from here:</b> The verse states concerning the occasion when Isaac blessed Jacob: <b>“And he smelled the smell of his garments,</b> and blessed him, and said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed” (Genesis 27:27). <b>Do not read “his garments [<i>begadav</i>]”; rather,</b> read: <b>His traitors [<i>bogedav</i>],</b> meaning that even traitors and sinners among the Jewish people have qualities “as the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.” |
| Song of Songs 6:11 | which is written: “I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley” | Chagigah 15b:10 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>say: Rabbi Meir ate a half-ripe date and threw the peel away.</b> In other words, he was able to extract the important content from the inedible shell. <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley”</b> (Song of Songs 6:11)? <b>Why are Torah scholars compared to nuts? To tell you: Just as this nut, despite being soiled with mud and excrement, its content is not made repulsive,</b> as only its shell is soiled; <b>so too a Torah scholar, although he has sinned, his Torah is not made repulsive.</b> |
| Song of Songs 7:1 | and it is written: “Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look [ veneḥeze ] upon you” | Bava Batra15b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The generation of Job was awash in licentiousness, as it is stated: “Behold, all of you yourselves have seen [<i>ḥazitem</i>] it; why then have you become altogether vain?”</b> (Job 27:12), <b>and it is written: “Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look [<i>veneḥeze</i>] upon you”</b> (Song of Songs 7:1), which teaches that the phrase “you have seen it” connotes a licentious gaze. The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> that the phrase “you yourselves have seen it” signifies <b>prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [<i>ḥazon</i>] of Isaiah ben Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). The Gemara answers: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the words: <b>“Why then have you become altogether vain”?</b> Rather, the reference must be to inappropriate licentious gazing. |
| Song of Songs 7:2 | and it says: “How beautiful are your feet [ fe’amayikh ] in sandals, daughter of the prince” | Chagigah 3a:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the term <b>“<i>regalim</i>” is necessary</b> to <b>exclude people with artificial legs.</b> Although these people are capable of walking, as they do not have two natural legs they are exempt from ascending to the Temple. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from:</b> “Three <b>occasions [<i>pe’amim</i>]</b> in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). The term <i>pe’amim</i> can also mean legs, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the term <b>“<i>pe’amim</i>”: <i>Pe’amim</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>legs. And so it says: “The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps [<i>pa’amei</i>] of the needy”</b> (Isaiah 26:6), <b>and it says: “How beautiful are your feet [<i>fe’amayikh</i>] in sandals, daughter of the prince”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2). |
| Song of Songs 7:2 | “Your rounded thighs are like jewels, | Moed Katan16a:23 | <b>Once again, on another occasion, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>decreed that students not be taught in the marketplace</b> but only in a study hall. <b>What</b> verse did he <b>expound</b> to serve as the basis for this decree? The verse states: <b>“Your rounded thighs are like jewels,</b> the work of the hands of an artist” (Song of Songs 7:2). <b>Just</b> as <b>a thigh is</b> ordinarily <b>hidden</b> and kept covered with clothes, |
| Song of Songs 7:2 | were created from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “The hidden of your thighs are like the links of a chain, the handiwork of a skilled workman” | Sukkah 49a:2 | § <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The drainpipes [<i>shittin</i>]</b> built into the altar and extending beneath it <b>were created from the six days of Creation, as it is stated: “The hidden of your thighs are like the links of a chain, the handiwork of a skilled workman”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2). The Gemara interprets the verse homiletically: <b>“The hidden of your thighs”; these are the drainpipes</b> that are concealed within the altar; <b>“are like the links of a chain [<i>ḥala’im</i>]”; they are hollow [<i>meḥolalin</i>] and descend to the depths; “the handiwork of a skilled workman”; this is the handiwork of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> On a similar note, <b>it was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that it is written: <b>“In the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:1); <b>do not read</b> it as: <b><i>Bereshit</i>, but rather as: <i>Bara shit</i>,</b> meaning that God created the pipeline descending from the altar. |
| Song of Songs 7:2 | which is written: “How beautiful are your steps in sandals, O prince’s daughter” | Sukkah 49b:6 | § Apropos the homiletic interpretations of the verses from Song of Songs with regard to the drainpipes, the Gemara cites additional interpretations. <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “How beautiful are your steps in sandals, O prince’s daughter”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2)? <b>How beautiful are the feet of the Jewish people at the time when they ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the Festival. “O prince’s daughter”;</b> this is referring to <b>the daughter of Abraham our Patriarch, who was called prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered, the people of the God of Abraham”</b> (Psalms 47:10). The verse calls the Jewish people the people of <b>the God of Abraham and not the God of Isaac and Jacob.</b> Why are the Jewish people associated specifically with Abraham? <b>Rather</b> than referring to the three Patriarchs, the verse is referring to <b>the God of Abraham, who was first of the converts,</b> and therefore it is reasonable for the princes of other nations to gather around him. |
| Song of Songs 7:2 | which is written: “The hidden of your thighs” | Sukkah 49b:7 | In <b>the school of Rav Anan</b> it was <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The hidden of your thighs”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2)? <b>Why are matters of Torah likened to a thigh?</b> It is <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> the <b>thigh is</b> always <b>concealed,</b> covered by clothes, so <b>too, matters of Torah</b> are optimal when recited <b>in private</b> and not in public. |
| Song of Songs 7:3 | for an optional matter, may they go out? But isn’t it written: “Your navel is like a round goblet wherein no blended wine is lacking” | Sanhedrin 14b:5 | The Gemara clarifies: In the case discussed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>how many</b> members of the Sanhedrin <b>went out</b> to Beit Pagei? <b>If we say</b> that only <b>some of them</b> went out, there is no significance in such a ruling issued by the rebellious elder, as <b>perhaps those who are inside</b> the Chamber of Hewn Stone are the majority and <b>hold in accordance with his</b> opinion; in which case he certainly would not be deemed a rebellious elder. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that they all went out.</b> And <b>for what</b> reason did they go out? <b>If we say</b> that they did so <b>for an optional matter, may they go out? But isn’t it written: “Your navel is like a round goblet wherein no blended wine is lacking”</b> (Song of Songs 7:3), from which it is inferred that the Sanhedrin sit in a half-circle, and there must never be more than two-thirds of them lacking, as this is the measure of wine blended in water. <b>Rather,</b> since the Sanhedrin may not leave the chamber unnecessarily, it is <b>obvious</b> that they went out <b>for a matter</b> relating to <b>a mitzva.</b> |
| Song of Songs 7:3 | Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “Your navel is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting; | Sanhedrin 37a:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the Sanhedrin would sit in a semicircle. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “Your navel is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting;</b> your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies” (Song of Songs 7:3). |
| Song of Songs 7:3 | for an optional matter, may they leave? But isn’t it written: “Your navel [ shorerekh ] is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting” | Sotah 45a:7 | The assumption that they all went out leads to the following question: <b>And for what</b> purpose did they all leave the Hewn Chamber? <b>If</b> it was <b>for an optional matter, may they leave? But isn’t it written: “Your navel [<i>shorerekh</i>] is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting”</b> (Song of Songs 7:3). This verse is interpreted as referring to the Sanhedrin, the ministers [<i>sarei</i>] of Israel who sit in a semicircle, like half of a round goblet. The words “let no mingled wine be wanting” teach <b>that if one of</b> the great Sanhedrin <b>needed to leave,</b> then <b>if there are</b> still present in the Hewn Chamber <b>twenty-three</b> members, <b>corresponding</b> to the number of <b>a lesser Sanhedrin, he may leave; and if not, he may not leave.</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for the entire Sanhedrin to leave for an optional matter. |
| Song of Songs 7:9 | which is written: “I said: I will climb into the palm tree; I will grasp its boughs” | Sanhedrin 93a:3 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says</b> on a similar note: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I said: I will climb into the palm tree; I will grasp its boughs”</b> (Song of Songs 7:9)? <b>“I said: I will climb into the palm tree”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the Jewish people,</b> who are likened to a palm tree, as they are upright and have one heart directed toward their Father in Heaven. God continues: <b>And now</b> that I have tested them by means of the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>I have succeeded</b> in grasping <b>in My hand only</b> the <b>one bough of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</b> as only they were willing to give their lives. |
| Song of Songs 7:10 | “And the roof of your mouth is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those who are asleep” | Bekhorot 31b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ze’eiri says: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? The verse states: <b>“And the roof of your mouth is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those who are asleep”</b> (Song of Songs 7:10). Here, words of Torah in the mouths of the Jewish people are likened <b>to a pile [<i>kekhomer</i>] of grapes</b> left to warm before they are pressed, which causes the wine to exude from them easily: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a pile of grapes, when a person</b> places his finger on it and <b>touches it, it moves</b> and issues a sound as the wine bursts forth, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>Torah scholars, when a matter of <i>halakha</i> is stated in their name, their lips mouth</b> the words <b>in the grave.</b> |
| Song of Songs 7:10 | as it is written: “And your palate is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that sleep” | Sanhedrin 90b:11 | The proof <b>from Writings</b> is <b>as it is written: “And your palate is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that sleep”</b> (Song of Songs 7:10), indicating that the dead will ultimately rise and speak. The heretics said to him: <b>But perhaps merely their lips will move, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: Anyone in whose name a <i>halakha</i> is stated in this world, his lips move in the grave</b> as if repeating the statement cited in his name, <b>as it is stated: “Moving gently the lips of those that sleep.”</b> No proof may be cited from that verse, as it is unrelated to resurrection. |
| Song of Songs 7:10 | “And the roof of your mouth is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those who are asleep” | Yevamot 97a:1 | <b>that they will say a matter of <i>halakha</i> in my name in this world</b> when I have passed on to another world. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>any Torah scholar in whose name a matter of <i>halakha</i> is said in this world, his lips mouth</b> the words <b>in the grave,</b> as though he is talking. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ze’eira said, and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Shimon the Nazirite: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“And the roof of your mouth is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those who are asleep”</b> (Song of Songs 7:10). |
| Song of Songs 7:14 | “The baskets [ duda’im ] yield a fragrance” | Eruvin 21b:2 | <b>Good figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged righteous</b> people; <b>bad figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged wicked</b> people. <b>And lest you say that the hope</b> of the wicked <b>is lost and their prospect is void, the verse states,</b> interpreting the word <i>duda’im</i> homiletically: <b>“The baskets [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 7:14), meaning that <b>both of them,</b> the righteous and the wicked, <b>will eventually yield a fragrance.</b> |
| Song of Songs 7:14 | which is written: | Eruvin 21b:3 | <b>Rava interpreted</b> the verse cited above <b>homiletically</b> as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved” (Song of Songs 7:14)? <b>“The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance,” these are the young men of Israel who have never tasted the taste of sin.</b> |
| Song of Songs 8:2 | if he is a Torah scholar, he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate” | Berakhot 57a:7 | <b>One who sees a fig tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof”</b> (Proverbs 27:18). <b>One who sees pomegranates in a dream,</b> if they were <b>small, his business will flourish like the seeds of</b> the <b>pomegranate,</b> which are numerous; and if they were <b>large, his business will increase like a pomegranate.</b> One who saw <b>slices of pomegranates</b> in his dream, <b>if he is a Torah scholar, he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 8:2), which is traditionally understood as an allusion to Torah. <b>And if</b> the dreamer <b>is an ignoramus, he should anticipate mitzvot,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Your temples are like a split pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3). As the Gemara previously interpreted homiletically: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>“Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>]”? Even the most ignorant [<i>reikanin</i>] among you,</b> Israel, <b>are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate.</b> |
| Song of Songs 8:5 | in remembrance of the apple, | Pesachim 116a:3 | The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that eating <i>ḥaroset</i> is <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the nature of this <b>mitzva?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> It is <b>in remembrance of the apple,</b> as apple is one of the ingredients in <i>ḥaroset</i>. The verse states: “Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, reclining upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you” (Song of Songs 8:5), which is an allusion to the Jewish people leaving Egypt. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>ḥaroset</i> is <b>in remembrance of the mortar</b> used by the Jews for their slave labor in Egypt. <b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> to fulfill both opinions, one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>tart and</b> one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>thick.</b> One must prepare it <b>tart in remembrance of the apple, and</b> one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>thick in remembrance of the mortar.</b> |
| Song of Songs 8:5 | they would go and give birth in the field under the apple tree, as it is stated: “Under the apple tree I awakened you; | Sotah 11b:6 | <b>And when</b> these women would <b>become pregnant, they would come</b> back <b>to their homes, and when the time for them to give birth</b> would arrive <b>they would go and give birth in the field under the apple tree, as it is stated: “Under the apple tree I awakened you;</b> there your mother was in travail with you; there was she in travail and brought you forth” (Song of Songs 8:5). |
| Song of Songs 8:6 | saying before Him: Master of the Universe: “Set me as a seal upon Your heart, as a seal upon Your arm” | Taanit 4a:13 | <b>And</b> the Congregation of Israel <b>further entreated</b> God <b>unreasonably</b> in another context, <b>saying before Him: Master of the Universe: “Set me as a seal upon Your heart, as a seal upon Your arm”</b> (Song of Songs 8:6). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to her: My daughter, you ask</b> that I be manifest to you in <b>a matter that is sometimes visible and sometimes not visible,</b> as the heart and arm are not covered. <b>However, I will act</b> so that I manifest Myself <b>for you</b> like <b>a matter that is always visible, as it is stated: “Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands,</b> your walls are continually before me” (Isaiah 49:16). |
| Song of Songs 8:7 | he would utterly be condemned” | Sotah 21a:16 | The Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse cited by the <i>baraita</i> with regard to Torah study: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love…if a man would give all the fortune of his house for love, <b>he would utterly be condemned”</b> (Song of Songs 8:7)? The Torah is compared to love several times in the Song of Songs. Therefore, the verse indicates that one cannot acquire a share in the reward for Torah study with money. <b>Ulla says:</b> The verse is <b>not</b> speaking of individuals <b>like Shimon, brother of Azarya,</b> whose brother Azarya supported him and enabled him to study Torah. <b>And</b> it is <b>not</b> speaking of individuals <b>like Rabbi Yoḥanan of the house of the <i>Nasi</i>,</b> whom the <i>Nasi</i> supported so that he could study Torah. |
| Song of Songs 8:7 | a Divine Voice issued forth and said: “If a man would give all the fortune of his house | Sotah 21a:17 | <b>Rather,</b> it is speaking of individuals <b>like Hillel and Shevna, as when Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia <b>he said: Hillel and Shevna were brothers; Hillel engaged in Torah</b> study and remained impoverished, whereas <b>Shevna entered into a</b> business <b>venture</b> and became wealthy. <b>In the end,</b> Shevna <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>Come, let us join</b> our wealth <b>together and divide</b> it between us; I will give you half of my money and you will give me half of the reward for your Torah study. In response to this request <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said: “If a man would give all the fortune of his house</b> for love, he would utterly be condemned” (Song of Songs 8:7). |
| Song of Songs 8:7 | as it is stated: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love, | Sotah 21a:9 | <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse associates the mitzva with a lamp and the Torah with the light of the sun in order to teach that <b>a transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva</b> one performed, <b>but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah</b> one studied, <b>as it is stated: “Many waters cannot extinguish the love,</b> neither can the floods drown it” (Song of Songs 8:7). The Torah is compared to love several times in the Song of Songs. One can conclude from the <i>baraita</i> that the merit of performing a mitzva is insufficient to suspend punishment. |
| Song of Songs 8:8 | As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts” | Kiddushin 49b:8 | The Gemara further asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t the Master say: A sign of arrogance</b> is <b>poverty, and there is poverty in Babylonia,</b> and not in Eilam. The Gemara answers: To <b>what</b> kind of <b>poverty</b> is this referring? It is <b>poverty with regard to Torah,</b> which was characteristic of Eilam. <b>As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 8:8), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> refers to <b>Eilam, whose</b> inhabitants <b>merited to learn but did not merit to teach.</b> They did not produce Torah scholars capable of imparting their wisdom to others. |
| Song of Songs 8:8 | “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts” | Pesachim 87a:7 | Apropos the verse from Song of Songs cited previously, the Gemara homiletically interprets an adjacent verse: <b>“We have a little sister, and she has no breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 8:8). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is</b> an allusion to the Jewish community of <b>Eilam, which was privileged to study</b> Torah and become Torah scholars, but <b>was not privileged to teach</b> and influence the masses. |
| Song of Songs 8:8 | As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts” | Sanhedrin 24a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the Master say: A sign of arrogance</b> is <b>poverty? And poverty descended to Babylonia,</b> not to Eilam. The Gemara answers: To <b>what</b> kind of <b>poverty</b> is this referring? It is <b>poverty</b> with regard to <b>Torah,</b> which was characteristic of Eilam. <b>As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 8:8), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> refers to <b>Eilam, whose</b> inhabitants <b>merited to learn</b> Torah <b>but did not merit to teach</b> it. They did not produce Torah scholars capable of imparting their wisdom to others. |
| Song of Songs 8:9 | as it is written: “If she be a wall we will build a silver turret upon her, if she be a door we will cover her with boards of cedar” | Yoma 9b:15 | <b>Reish Lakish was swimming in the Jordan River</b> when <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana came and gave him a hand</b> to help him out. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: My God! I hate you</b> Babylonians, <b>as it is written: “If she be a wall we will build a silver turret upon her, if she be a door we will cover her with boards of cedar”</b> (Song of Songs 8:9). This is the meaning of the verse as it applies to the Jewish people: <b>Had you rendered yourselves</b> a solid bloc <b>like a wall and all ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>in the days of Ezra, you would have been likened to silver, which rot does not infest,</b> in the sense that you would have merited experiencing the Divine Presence in all its glory. <b>Now that you ascended like doors,</b> and only some of you came to Eretz Yisrael, <b>you are likened to cedar, which rot infests,</b> and you merit experiencing only partial revelation of the Divine Presence. |
| Song of Songs 8:10 | to him: “I am a wall and my breasts are like towers” | Bava Batra7b:16 | <b>When</b> Reish Lakish <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and reported the exchange to him, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not quote this</b> verse <b>to him: “I am a wall and my breasts are like towers”</b> (Song of Songs 8:10), which may be explained as follows: <b>“I am a wall”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Torah. “And my breasts are like towers”;</b> |
| Song of Songs 8:10 | “Then I was in his eyes as one that found peace” | Ketubot 71b:14 | Once the Gemara has mentioned the idea of a woman who is eager to return to her father’s house, it discusses another context where a similar idea is mentioned. Concerning the verse <b>“Then I was in his eyes as one that found peace”</b> (Song of Songs 8:10), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The meaning is: <b>Like a bride who is considered perfect in her father-in-law’s house, and is eager to go and relate her praise in her father’s house,</b> to tell how many complimentary things were said about her by her husband’s family. |
| Song of Songs 8:10 | then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace” | Pesachim 87a:6 | There is a homiletic interpretation of verses that conveys a similar idea, <b>as it is written:</b> “I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; <b>then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace”</b> (Song of Songs 8:10). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> She is <b>like a bride who was found perfect.</b> She was warmly received <b>in her father-in-law’s house. And</b> she eagerly hurries, as one <b>pursued, to go to tell</b> of <b>her praise,</b> i.e., her warm welcome, <b>in her father’s house. As it is written: “And it shall be at that day, says the Lord, that you shall call Me: My Husband, and shall call Me no more: My Master”</b> (Hosea 2:18), of which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> She shall be <b>like a bride in her father-in-law’s house,</b> where she experiences a close relationship with her husband. <b>And</b> she shall <b>not</b> be <b>like a bride</b> still in the betrothal period and living <b>in her father’s house,</b> during which time her relationship with her husband has still not developed. |
| Song of Songs 8:10 | “I am a wall and my breasts are like towers” | Pesachim 87a:8 | The Gemara interprets another verse: <b>“I am a wall and my breasts are like towers”</b> (Song of Songs 8:10). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “I am a wall”; this is</b> a reference to the <b>Torah. “And my breasts are like towers”; these are the Torah scholars,</b> who, by disseminating their Torah and influencing the masses protect them like watchtowers. <b>And Rava said: “I am a wall”; this is the Congregation of Israel. “And my breasts are like towers”; these are the synagogues and study halls</b> in which the Congregation of Israel is nurtured by the Torah, from which it draws its spiritual strength. |
| Song of Songs 8:12 | for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit” | Shevuot 35b:16 | <b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7). |
| Song of Songs 8:13 | nothing other than Torah scholars, as it is stated: “You that dwell in the gardens, the companions [ ḥaverim ] hearken for your voice: Cause me to hear it” | Bava Batra75a:4 | <b>Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will make a feast for the righteous from the flesh of the leviathan, as it is stated: “The <i>ḥabbarim</i> will make a feast [<i>yikhru</i>] of him”</b> (Job 40:30). <b>And <i>kera</i></b> means <b>nothing other than a feast, as it is stated: “And he prepared [<i>va’yikhreh</i>] for them a great feast [<i>kera</i>]; and they ate and drank”</b> (II Kings 6:23). <b>And <i>ḥabbarim</i></b> means <b>nothing other than Torah scholars, as it is stated: “You that dwell in the gardens, the companions [<i>ḥaverim</i>] hearken for your voice: Cause me to hear it”</b> (Song of Songs 8:13). This verse is interpreted as referring to Torah scholars, who listen to God’s voice. |
