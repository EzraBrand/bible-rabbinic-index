| Bikkurim 1:3 | elsewhere | Menachot 84a:14 | § <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:3): <b>One may bring first fruits only from the seven species</b> with which Eretz Yisrael is praised in the verse: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8). <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> |
| Bikkurim 1:5 | this tanna , as we learned | Yevamot 57a:11 | <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan raised his dilemma <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:5) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A woman</b> who is <b>the daughter of converts may not marry into the priesthood unless her mother was Jewish</b> from birth. |
| Bikkurim 1:6 | hear | Bava Batra27a:6 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof from another mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): If one <b>bought two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> first fruits <b>and does not recite</b> the verses, because the land does not belong to him. It may be inferred from here that if he bought <b>three</b> trees <b>he does bring</b> first fruits <b>and recite</b> the verses. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the trees? The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <b>No; here too</b> it is referring to a case where he acquires <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the trees. |
| Bikkurim 1:6 | elsewhere | Bava Batra81a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passages of thanks to God that appear in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:1–11), as the land does not belong to him and therefore he cannot state: “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Rabbi Meir says: He brings</b> the first fruits <b>and</b> also <b>recites</b> the passage. |
| Bikkurim 1:6 | hear | Gittin 48a:6 | The Gemara suggests another proof in support of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): <b>One who acquires two trees in another’s field brings</b> the first fruits of those trees <b>but does not recite</b> the verses, as he acquires only the trees but not the land. <b>But</b> if one acquires <b>three</b> trees, he <b>brings</b> the first fruits of those trees <b>and recites</b> the verses, because he also acquires the land surrounding the trees, despite the fact that the land is returned in the Jubilee Year. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Here too,</b> Reish Lakish would explain that the mishna is referring to one who acquires three trees <b>in</b> the <b>time when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is not practiced.</b> |
| Bikkurim 1:11 | hear | Bava Batra27a:5 | The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Ulla. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:11): <b>One who buys a tree and its land brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the requisite Torah verses (Deuteronomy 26:5–11) over them. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the tree? The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No;</b> it is referring to a case where one buys <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the tree. |
| Bikkurim 1:11 | hear | Gittin 48a:5 | The Gemara offers a proof in support of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:11): <b>One who acquires a tree and its</b> surrounding <b>land brings</b> the first fruits of those trees <b>and recites</b> the verses, even though he is required to return the land in the Jubilee Year. The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> according to the opinion of Reish Lakish? The mishna is referring to one who acquires a tree and its surrounding land <b>in</b> the <b>time when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is not practiced,</b> so the acquisition is permanent. |
| Bikkurim 2:6 | that which we learned | Kiddushin 2b:15 | The Gemara further challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:6): The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a tree in three ways. Let it teach</b> instead: Three <b>matters.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Because it wants to teach in</b> the <b>latter clause: And</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an <i>etrog</i> tree correspond <b>to</b> those of <b>a vegetable in one way,</b> therefore the mishna uses the term: Ways, in the first clause as well. The Gemara asks: In the <b>latter clause too, let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Matter,</b> rather than: Way. |
| Bikkurim 2:6 | ripening, as we learned in a mishna | Sukkah 39b:6 | The Gemara objects: <b>But both Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who disagree about the status of an <i>etrog</i> that grew in one year and was picked in the following year in terms of determining its year for the <i>halakhot</i> of tithing, agree with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of</b> the <b>Sabbatical Year</b> that with regard to <b>an <i>etrog</i> we go</b> according to its <b>ripening, as we learned in a mishna</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:6): The halakhic status of the fruit of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>is like</b> that <b>of</b> a typical fruit <b>tree in three manners and</b> like that <b>of a vegetable in one manner.</b> |
| Bikkurim 2:8 | that which we learned | Kiddushin 3a:2 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> an animal whose classification was uncertain, as the Sages were unsure whether it is a domesticated or a non-domesticated animal, <b>there are ways,</b> i.e., <i>halakhot</i>, <b>in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a non-domesticated animal and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a domesticated animal. And there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of both <b>a non-domesticated animal and a domesticated animal, and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>neither a non-domesticated animal nor a domesticated animal. Let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the term: <b>Matters. And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 9a): <b>This is one of the ways in which</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce correspond to</b> those of bills of <b>manumission, let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b> |
| Bikkurim 3:3 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 54b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are tradesmen <b>not</b> permitted to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When the pilgrims bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all the tradesmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such place, welcome?</b> |
| Bikkurim 3:3 | But didn’t we learn | Kiddushin 33a:4 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are craftsmen <b>not</b> required to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When farmers bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all craftsmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such a place, welcome!</b> Since craftsmen would stand even for those engaged in a mitzva, all the more so should they stand for Torah scholars. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is no difficulty here, as indeed <b>they stood before</b> those bringing first fruits, and yet <b>they would not stand before Torah scholars.</b> |
| Bikkurim 3:5 | As we learned | Menachot 58a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in the case of <b>first fruits also,</b> the fruits should be considered part of the offering that was brought with them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:5): As for <b>the fledglings that</b> were placed <b>on top of the baskets</b> that contained the first fruits brought to the Temple, <b>they would</b> sacrifice these as <b>burnt offerings, and the baskets</b> themselves <b>that were in the possession</b> of those bringing the first fruits would <b>be given to the priests.</b> Accordingly, with regard to honey as well, its general prohibition was permitted in certain circumstances, as these first fruits containing honey are included with the sacrifice of burnt offerings. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> fledglings <b>came</b> only <b>to decorate</b> the <b>first fruits,</b> despite the fact that they were later sacrificed as burnt offerings. Bringing the fledglings is not obligatory, and therefore cannot be considered part of the same offering as first fruits. |
| Bikkurim 3:8 | said to him: As we learned | Bava Kamma92a:24 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Poverty follows the poor?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:8): <b>Rich</b> people would <b>bring first fruits in baskets of gold and of silver, and poor</b> people would bring first fruits <b>in wicker baskets</b> made <b>of peeled willow,</b> and <b>they would give the baskets and the first fruits to the priests.</b> The rich would have their baskets returned to them, while the poor would not. Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a mishna, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah: |
| Bikkurim 3:12 | with regard to that which we learned | Chullin 131a:7 | The Gemara explains the proof: <b>With regard to what</b> matter are these items considered the property of a priest? <b>Is it not with regard to extracting them with judges,</b> which would contradict the opinion of Rav Ḥisda? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:12): <b>To what</b> end did <b>they say</b> that these items are the <b>property of a priest?</b> It means <b>that</b> a priest may <b>purchase with them slaves and lands and a non-kosher animal; and a lender takes them</b> as payment <b>of his debt; and</b> if the <b>wife</b> of a priest is divorced from him, she takes them as payment <b>of her marriage contract; and</b> a priest may purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> with them. |
| Bikkurim 4:9 | raises an objection | Beitzah 8a:8 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 4:9): In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and non-domesticated animals, <b>one may not slaughter it on a Festival,</b> as it is uncertain whether or not its blood requires covering. <b>And if one did slaughter it, he may not cover its blood. And if it is so,</b> that one may use his basket of earth as he wishes, as claimed by Rav Yehuda, even if a <i>koy</i> is definitely a domesticated animal, <b>let him cover it, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda.</b> |
