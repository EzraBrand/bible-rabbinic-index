| Zavim 1:1 | And furthermore, we learned | Niddah 72a:18 | Abaye continues: <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 1:1): If a man <b>sees one sighting of <i>ziva</i></b> (see 35b), <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> His status on the following day is <b>like</b> that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. In other words, he must immerse and observe that day in purity, and if he touches tithes their status is suspended, since if he sees another discharge on that day, they are retroactively impure. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> His status is <b>like</b> that of a man <b>who experiences a seminal emission,</b> who is purified by his immersion, and therefore any tithes this man touches on the second day remain pure even if he later experiences a second discharge. |
| Zavim 2:1 | What is added | Arakhin 3a:4 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the clause in the mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]?</b> This serves <b>to add</b> that even <b>a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge becomes impure. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>A man. Why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)? This serves <b>to include a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that</b> even <b>he becomes impure as</b> one who experiences <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Zavim 2:2 | But isn’t it taught | Nazir 65b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: For the third</b> discharge <b>one</b> still <b>examines him; for the fourth</b> discharge <b>one does not examine him.</b> Where does the verse allude to the fourth discharge? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, they disagree with regard to</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>,”</b> i.e., whether or not the word “<i>et</i>” teaches an additional <i>halakha</i>, or whether it is written purely for syntactical reasons. <b>Rabbi Eliezer expounds</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>,”</b> and therefore he counts the phrase “<i>zav et zovo</i>” as three words referring to three discharges. <b>And the Rabbis do not expound</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>,”</b> which means that in their opinion this verse alludes to only two discharges. |
| Zavim 2:2 | hear | Niddah 35a:7 | The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rav Huna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2): With regard to a man who <b>saw a first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. <b>What, is it not</b> that the purpose of this examination is <b>to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., if the discharge was due to circumstances beyond his control he remains pure, which contradicts the statement of Rav Huna? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the purpose of this examination is <b>to</b> determine whether he will be obligated to bring <b>an offering</b> if he experiences another two discharges of <i>ziva</i>. If the first sighting was caused by circumstances beyond his control, it is not counted toward the three sightings that render one liable to bring an offering. |
| Zavim 2:2 | as we learned | Niddah 37a:5 | Rava <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not so [<i>la’ei</i>],</b> as <b>this</b> emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control <b>is also</b> a substance that <b>causes</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2): With regard to a man who <b>saw a first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. After the <b>second</b> sighting of <i>ziva</i> as well, <b>one examines him.</b> But after the <b>third</b> sighting <b>one does not examine him,</b> as even if the third sighting occurred due to circumstances beyond his control he is nevertheless rendered a <i>zav</i> on its account. |
| Zavim 2:3 | Rava said to him: But didn’t we learn | Nazir 66a:5 | When he was <b>before Rava, Rav Pappa thought to say</b> the following explanation for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Since he sees</b> his discharges <b>out of</b> the <b>weakness</b> brought about from his previous <i>ziva</i>, it can be assumed that any later discharge, even one that follows a seminal emission, is <i>ziva</i>. <b>Rava said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:3): <b>A convert who</b> has just <b>converted can immediately become impure as a <i>zav</i>.</b> Even if he had a seminal emission as a gentile, subsequently converted, and then experienced the discharge of a <i>zav</i>, one does not associate the discharge of a <i>zav</i> with the earlier emission of semen. Rather, it is treated as the first discharge of a <i>zav</i>. In this case there is no prior weakness of a <i>zav</i> to speak of, and nevertheless the convert is impure as a <i>zav</i>. Rav Pappa <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>There is no greater illness than this.</b> The very acceptance of mitzvot can be considered an illness, as the burden of mitzvot is a weighty matter. For this reason, one does not ascribe a discharge of a <i>zav</i> to the earlier emission of semen. |
| Zavim 2:9 | that which we learned | Nazir 63a:6 | The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 2:9): <b>Which is the ritual impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths?</b> It is impurity imparted by <b>any</b> corpse <b>of which no one is aware,</b> even <b>at the end of the earth.</b> This type of impurity is permitted for both a nazirite and one who sacrifices the Paschal offering. <b>However,</b> if even <b>one</b> person <b>is aware of it,</b> even <b>at the end of the earth, this is not impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths.</b> |
| Zavim 3:2 | of leaning, as we learned | Niddah 7a:3 | <b>Rather,</b> the uncertainty referred to here is similar to the less likely case <b>of leaning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 3:2): In a case of <b>a <i>zav</i> and a ritually pure</b> person <b>who were unloading</b> a package <b>from a donkey or</b> who were <b>loading</b> a package onto a donkey, <b>when their package</b> is <b>heavy</b> the pure person is rendered <b>impure,</b> as perhaps the <i>zav</i> leaned on him while they handled the package together. If <b>their package</b> is <b>light,</b> he remains <b>pure. And</b> in <b>all those</b> cases, he remains ritually <b>pure</b> even if he is one of the <b>members of a synagogue</b> whose congregants handle non-sacred food according to the standards of sacrificial food, as this is not a true case of a <i>zav</i> moving a pure person. <b>But</b> he is <b>impure with regard to</b> matters involving <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> by rabbinic law. |
| Zavim 5:9 | of this kind is also taught | Chullin 120a:22 | The Gemara comments: A novelty <b>of this kind is also taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 5:9) <b>with regard to</b> one who eats <b>the</b> unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird: One who liquefied</b> the carcass of an unslaughtered kosher bird <b>in fire</b> and drank the substance <b>is impure.</b> But one who liquefied it <b>in the sun</b> and drank it <b>is pure. And we discussed it: Eating</b> and not drinking <b>is stated</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass, as it is written: “And every soul that eats an unslaughtered carcass or that which is mauled by an animal, whether he is native or stranger, he shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). Why, then, does one who drinks a kosher bird carcass become impure? |
| Zavim 5:9 | hear | Nazir 50a:10 | The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 5:9): The fat of an animal carcass <b>that</b> someone <b>liquefied in fire is</b> still <b>impure.</b> However, if it melted <b>in the sun,</b> which impairs its taste, it is <b>pure. And if it enters your mind</b> that according to the opinion that a carcass imparts impurity <b>until</b> it becomes inedible <b>for a dog</b> the impurity of fluids does apply to an animal carcass, if so, <b>even</b> fat that dissolved <b>in the sun</b> should <b>also</b> be impure. Even if its taste is spoiled, it remains edible for a dog. |
| Zavim 5:12 | Rabbi Yirmeya says: They said | Gittin 16a:6 | The Gemara cites another question with regard to this issue. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: They said</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 5:12): In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his</b> body <b>enter</b> into <b>drawn water</b> after he immersed himself in a ritual bath to purify himself, <b>and a ritually pure person</b> concerning <b>whom three <i>log</i></b> of <b>drawn water fell on his head and most of his</b> body, both of these people are <b>ritually impure.</b> With regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>half of</b> a person became purified <b>by entering</b> into drawn water <b>and half of him</b> became purified <b>by</b> having water <b>fall</b> on him, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do these acts join together to render him ritually impure or not? No answer is found, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
