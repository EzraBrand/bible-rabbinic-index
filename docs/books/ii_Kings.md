| ii Kings 4:30 | and he arose and followed her” | Eruvin 18b:6 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this: If that is so,</b> if the verse relating to Manoah is understood literally, what will one say about the verse <b>with regard to Elkana,</b> the father of the prophet Samuel, <b>as it is written: “And Elkana walked after his wife.”</b> Does <b>this</b> verse mean that Elkana was <b>also</b> an ignorant person? <b>And</b> what of the verse <b>with regard to</b> the prophet <b>Elisha, as it is written:</b> “And the mother of the child said: As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you; <b>and he arose and followed her”</b> (ii Kings 4:30). Does <b>this</b> verse mean that Elisha was <b>also</b> an uneducated person? |
| ii Kings 20:4 | from the same verse, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle courtyard, | Eruvin 26a:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Both</b> Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <b>derived</b> their opinion <b>from the same verse, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle courtyard,</b> that the word of the Lord came to him, saying” (ii Kings 20:4). In the biblical text, <b>it is written: “The city [<i>ha’ir</i>],” and we read</b> it as: “The middle <b>courtyard [<i>ḥatzer</i>],”</b> as there is a difference in this verse between the written word and how it is spoken. <b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>royal courts were</b> as large <b>as intermediate-</b>sized <b>cities.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction, as the central courtyard of the royal palace was itself like a small town. |
