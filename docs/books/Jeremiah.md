| Jeremiah 1:1 | from Anathoth, as it is written: “The statements of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin” | Sanhedrin 95a:1 | <b>“Poor [<i>aniyya</i>] Anathoth”</b> (Isaiah 10:30)? <b>Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, is destined to prophesy about</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>from Anathoth, as it is written: “The statements of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin”</b> (Jeremiah 1:1). |
| Jeremiah 1:3 | “And it came to pass in the days of [ vayhi bimei ] Jehoiakim” | Megillah 10b:12 | The Gemara states that <b>there are five</b> instances of <b><i>vayhi bimei</i></b> in the Bible. <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahasuerus”; “And it came to pass in the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges ruled”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amraphel”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahaz”</b> (Isaiah 7:1); <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Jehoiakim”</b> (Jeremiah 1:3). In all those incidents, grief ensued. |
| Jeremiah 1:5 | “Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, | Yoma 82b:2 | § With respect to a pregnant woman who smells food, it is told: <b>A certain pregnant woman smelled</b> a food and craved it. Those involved <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi to ask how to proceed. <b>He said to those</b> who were inquiring: <b>Go and whisper to her that today is Yom Kippur. They whispered to her, and this whispering helped;</b> she stopped craving the food. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> this verse <b>about</b> the baby she was carrying: <b>“Before I formed you in the belly I knew you,</b> and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you” (Jeremiah 1:5), and indeed, the baby who <b>came out of</b> that woman was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> |
| Jeremiah 1:14 | “Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land” | Bava Batra25b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that <b>the Divine Presence is in the west.</b> How, then, can one pray facing south? The Gemara explains <b>that one should turn aside</b> slightly, so that he faces southwest. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said to Rav Ashi:</b> An individual <b>such as you, who lives to the north of Eretz Yisrael, should face south</b> when you pray. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Babylonia is located to the north of Eretz Yisrael? As it is written</b> in a prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians: <b>“Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land”</b> (Jeremiah 1:14). |
| Jeremiah 1:14 | “Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north the evil shall break forth” | Gittin 6a:11 | <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: From Rekem eastward</b> is considered to be part of the overseas country, <b>and Rekem</b> itself <b>is like east</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Ashkelon southward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Ashkelon</b> itself <b>is like south</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Akko northward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Akko</b> itself <b>is like north</b> of Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Yirmeya explains his objection: <b>But Babylonia is situated north of Eretz Yisrael, as it is written</b> with regard to the destruction that will come through Babylonia: <b>“Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north the evil shall break forth”</b> (Jeremiah 1:14). |
| Jeremiah 2:2 | I remember for you the affection of your youth, the love of your espousals, how you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown” | Sanhedrin 110b:5 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The generation of the wilderness <b>comes to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come singing into Zion”</b> (Isaiah 35:10), meaning that those whom God redeemed will yet come to Zion. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Akiva abandoned his piety</b> and uncharacteristically interpreted the verses harshly, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the generation of the wilderness: <b>“Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying,</b> so says the Lord: <b>I remember for you the affection of your youth, the love of your espousals, how you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown”</b> (Jeremiah 2:2). <b>Now, if others come</b> into the World-to-Come <b>in the merit of</b> the generation that left Egypt and followed God in the wilderness, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that the generation of the wilderness <b>themselves</b> have a share in the World-to-Come? |
| Jeremiah 2:3 | which it is written: “The Jewish people are the Lord’s holy portion, His first fruits of the increase” | Kiddushin 53a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But there is <i>teruma</i>,</b> about <b>which it is written: “The Jewish people are the Lord’s holy portion, His first fruits of the increase”</b> (Jeremiah 2:3)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (58a) that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>teruma</i>, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to the Jewish people,</b> who are called the Lord’s holy portion, but not with regard to <i>teruma</i> itself. |
| Jeremiah 2:3 | I called you first, | Shabbat 32a:1 | <b>I called you first,</b> as it is stated: “Israel is the Lord’s hallowed portion, His first fruits of the increase” (Jeremiah 2:3) <b>and I warned you about matters of the first:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart <i>ḥalla</i> for a gift” (Numbers 15:20). <b>The soul that I have placed in you is called <i>ner</i>:</b> “The spirit of man is the lamp [<i>ner</i>] of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27), and <b>I warned you about matters of the</b> Shabbat <b>lamp. If you fulfill these</b> mitzvot, <b>fine, and if not, then I will take your soul.</b> |
| Jeremiah 2:5 | And it says: “What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me?” | Chagigah 9b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said: Any Torah scholar who leaves the Torah, about him the verse says: “As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place”</b> (Proverbs 27:8). <b>And it says: “What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me?”</b> (Jeremiah 2:5). This indicates that the punishment is greater for one who was close to God and became distant from Him. In any case, there is a contradiction here, as in the mishna Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says that the act of one who fathers an illegitimate child is crooked and cannot be straightened, whereas in the <i>baraita</i> he says the same applies to anyone who has forbidden sexual relations, regardless of whether or not he fathers a child. |
| Jeremiah 2:6 | that which is written: “In a land through which no man has passed and where no person [ adam ] has settled” | Berakhot 31a:15 | Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to him: You reminded me of something that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> said, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “In a land through which no man has passed and where no person [<i>adam</i>] has settled”</b> (Jeremiah 2:6)? This verse is difficult; <b>since it is</b> a land through which <b>no</b> person <b>has passed, how</b> could anyone <b>have settled</b> there permanently? The statement that “no person has settled there” is redundant. <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to teach</b> that <b>every land</b> through <b>which Adam the first</b> man passed and <b>decreed that it would be settled was settled, and every land</b> through <b>which</b> Adam passed and <b>decreed that it would not be settled was not settled.</b> Based on this, what people say is true, and the palm trees of Babylonia are from the time of Adam, meaning that from the time of Adam this land was decreed to be suitable for growing palm trees (<i>Me’iri</i>). The Gemara cited an example of how one who parts from another with Torah learns something new. |
| Jeremiah 2:6 | which is written: “Through a land that no man passed through, and where no person [ adam ] dwelt”? | Sotah 46b:17 | Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to him:</b> By mentioning Adam the first man <b>you reminded me of something that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Through a land that no man passed through, and where no person [<i>adam</i>] dwelt”?</b> (Jeremiah 2:6). This verse is difficult: <b>Since it</b> is a land <b>through which no</b> man <b>has passed, where would he dwell? And if he did not dwell, where did he pass?</b> Why does the verse add that no person has dwelled there? <b>Rather,</b> this is the meaning: Any <b>land</b> concerning <b>which Adam the first</b> man <b>decreed that it would be a settled area, was settled;</b> but <b>a land</b> concerning <b>which Adam the first</b> man <b>did not decree that</b> it should be settled, <b>was not settled.</b> |
| Jeremiah 2:13 | which is written: “For my people have committed two evils” | Taanit 5a:14 | <b>And Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For my people have committed two evils”</b> (Jeremiah 2:13)? <b>Were there</b> only <b>two</b> evils they performed? Were, then, the <b>twenty-four</b> violations listed in the book of Ezekiel <b>abandoned,</b> i.e., pardoned? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> They have violated <b>one</b> transgression <b>that is</b> |
| Jeremiah 2:13 | Idol worship, as it is written: “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns” | Taanit 5b:1 | <b>equivalent to two. And what is this</b> sin? <b>Idol worship, as it is written: “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns”</b> (Jeremiah 2:13), <b>and it is written about</b> the Jewish people: <b>“For pass over the isles of the Kittim and see; and send to Kedar and observe carefully, and</b> see if there has been such a thing. <b>Has a nation exchanged its gods, although they are no gods? But My people has exchanged its glory for that which does not profit”</b> (Jeremiah 2:10–11). |
| Jeremiah 2:22 | said to a child: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “For though you wash with niter, and take for you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me” | Chagigah 15a:13 | Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir <b>took hold of him</b> and <b>brought him to the study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to a child,</b> by way of divination: <b>Recite your verse</b> that you studied today <b>to me. He recited</b> the following verse <b>to him: “There is no peace, said the Lord, concerning the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 48:22). <b>He brought him to another study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to a child: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “For though you wash with niter, and take for you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22). <b>He brought him to another study hall.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to</b> |
| Jeremiah 2:22 | Is never sealed? But isn’t it written: “Yet the stain [ nikhtam ] of your iniquity is before Me” | Rosh Hashanah18a:10 | <b>Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the sentence of a community is never sealed [<i>neḥtam</i>]?</b> The Gemara immediately asks: <b>Is never sealed? But isn’t it written: “Yet the stain [<i>nikhtam</i>] of your iniquity is before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22), which implies that the sentence of a community is indeed sealed. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the question was as follows: From where is it known with regard to the sentence of a community that <b>although it is sealed, it can</b> still <b>be torn up? As it is stated: “As is the Lord our God whenever we call out to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7). This implies that there is always a way to draw close to God. |
| Jeremiah 2:22 | it is written: “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet the stain of your iniquity is before Me, | Rosh Hashanah18a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Can a sentence of a community</b> really <b>be torn up</b> because they have repented? <b>But one verse says:</b> “O Jerusalem, <b>wash your heart from wickedness,</b> that you may be saved” (Jeremiah 4:14), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet the stain of your iniquity is before Me,</b> says the Lord God” (Jeremiah 2:22). <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>here</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>before the sentence,</b> when the heart can still be washed with repentance, whereas <b>there</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>after the sentence,</b> when washing no longer helps, as the sentence cannot be canceled? |
| Jeremiah 2:22 | not sealed? But isn’t it written: “For although you wash yourself with niter, and take much soap for yourself, yet your iniquity is marked before Me” | Yevamot 105a:16 | With regard to a decree of judgment that cannot be torn up, <b>Rav Shmuel bar Unya said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a sentence of judgment upon a community is never sealed?</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Is it</b> truly <b>not sealed? But isn’t it written: “For although you wash yourself with niter, and take much soap for yourself, yet your iniquity is marked before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22), indicating that there is no longer any atonement for iniquity of a community. |
| Jeremiah 2:25 | “Withhold your foot from being barefoot, and your throat from thirst” | Yoma 77a:13 | <b>Rather,</b> a different source must be found. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that we derive it <b>from here:</b> It states: <b>“Withhold your foot from being barefoot, and your throat from thirst”</b> (Jeremiah 2:25), meaning: <b>Keep yourself from sin, so that your feet will not come to be barefoot; keep your tongue from idle talk, so that your throat will not come to be thirsty.</b> Consequently, we learn that being barefoot is considered an affliction. |
| Jeremiah 2:27 | states: “For they have turned their oref unto Me, and not their face” | Chullin 19b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the phrase <b>“adjacent to [<i>mimmul</i>] its <i>oref</i>,” adjacent</b> means a place <b>that sees the <i>oref</i></b>  and not the <i>oref</i> itself. <b>And likewise,</b> the verse <b>states: “And they reside adjacent to me [<i>mimmuli</i>]”</b> (Numbers 22:5); <b>and</b> the verse <b>states: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face”</b> (Jeremiah 2:27). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the latter proof, introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say, we do not know where the <i>oref</i> itself</b> is, so <b>that we will know where adjacent to it is, come</b> and <b>hear: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face,”</b> from which it may be ascertained <b>by inference that the <i>oref</i> is opposite the face,</b> at the rear of the head. |
| Jeremiah 2:27 | and so it says: “They say to a tree: You are my father, | Yevamot 48b:1 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “Her father”</b> means <b>her actual father</b> and <b>“her mother”</b> means <b>her actual mother. Rabbi Akiva says: Her father and her mother; this</b> is referring to the <b>idolatrous deity</b> that she had worshiped but will no longer be able to worship, <b>and so it says: “They say to a tree: You are my father,</b> and to a stone: You have given birth to us” (Jeremiah 2:27). |
| Jeremiah 2:29 | as it is written: “Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord” | Bava Kamma92a:17 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: The cabbage is damaged together with the thorn,</b> since the cabbage is sometimes harmed when the thorn is removed? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 2:29). The term “you all” includes even those who have not sinned. |
| Jeremiah 2:30 | from here: “In vain I smote your children” | Ketubot 72a:15 | § The mishna also stated: <b>Or she vows and does not fulfill</b> her vows. The Gemara clarifies the reason for this, as it is different from the other cases in the mishna, where she causes her husband to violate a prohibition. In this case it is only she who violates a prohibition. <b>As the Master said: Due to</b> the sin of unfulfilled <b>vows, children die, as it is stated:</b> “It is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. <b>Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh to sin…</b>why should the Lord become angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?” (Ecclesiastes 5:4–5). <b>And what is the work of a person’s hands? You must say</b> it is referring to <b>his sons and his daughters. Rav Naḥman said:</b> A proof to the above idea may be brought <b>from here: “In vain I smote your children”</b> (Jeremiah 2:30). The phrase <b>“in vain”</b> means: <b>For matters</b> caused by <b>vain</b> words, meaning that you took a vow and did not fulfill it. |
| Jeremiah 2:30 | As it is written: “In vain have I smitten your children; they received no morality” | Shabbat 32b:3 | In order to clarify which sins cause one’s young children to die, the Gemara cites what <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For the sin of vows, one’s children die,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: For the sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that one’s children die <b>due to the sin of vows, as we stated</b> above. <b>However, according to the</b> opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that one’s children die <b>due to sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, what is the verse</b> that supports this? The Gemara replies: <b>As it is written: “In vain have I smitten your children; they received no morality”</b> (Jeremiah 2:30). Children die because their fathers did not accept the morality, the Torah. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: According to the one who said</b> that one’s children die <b>because of the sin of vows, it can also</b> be derived <b>from here: In vain have I smitten your children; on matters of vanity,</b> i.e., when one vows in vain and does not fulfill it. The Gemara asks: <b>After all, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is Rabbi, and</b> it was taught in a <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi said</b> that one’s children die <b>because of the sin of vows.</b> How then could it be that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said that it is due to the sin of dereliction in the study of Torah? The Gemara answers: <b>After he heard it from Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> he reconsidered and taught in accordance with Rabbi Elazar’s opinion. |
| Jeremiah 2:34 | as is written: “Also in your corners is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor” | Shabbat 32b:5 | The <i>tanna</i>’<i>im</i> <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda</b> also <b>disagreed about this. One said:</b> Children die <b>due to the sin of <i>mezuza</i>, and one said</b> children die <b>due to the sin of</b> not affixing <b>ritual fringes.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that children die <b>due to the sin of <i>mezuza</i>,</b> it is based on the juxtaposition of the verses, <b>as it is written: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house,</b> and upon your gates,” <b>and it says thereafter: “</b>T<b>hat your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children.” However, according to the one who said</b> that children die <b>because of the sin of ritual fringes, what is the reason?</b> What is the connection between these matters? <b>Rav Kahana said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Sheila Mari:</b> It is homiletically interpreted <b>as is written: “Also in your corners is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor”</b> (Jeremiah 2:34). Due to one’s failure to affix ritual fringes to the corners of his garments, the innocent poor, young children, who have not had opportunity to sin, die. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: According to the one who said</b> that children die <b>because of the sin of <i>mezuza</i>, it is also</b> derived <b>from here, as it is written</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“You did not find them breaking in;</b> yet for all these things.” We see that this punishment comes <b>because they made entrances like a</b> thief’s <b>breach</b> in the wall. They did not place <i>mezuzot</i> in their entrances. |
| Jeremiah 3:1 | forbidden sexual relations; and so it states: “Saying, if a man sends his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man’s… | Sanhedrin 56b:7 | With regard to the term <b>“saying,” this</b> alludes to <b>forbidden sexual relations; and so it states: “Saying, if a man sends his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man’s…</b>will that land not be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot with many lovers” (Jeremiah 3:1). <b>“Of every tree of the garden”</b> alludes to the fact that one may partake only of items that are permitted to him, as they belong to him, <b>and</b> he may <b>not</b> partake of <b>stolen items. “You may freely eat”</b> alludes to the fact that one may eat fruit, <b>but not a limb from a living</b> animal. |
| Jeremiah 3:1 | “…Saying: If a man sends away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, may he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; and would you yet return to Me, said the Lord” | Yoma 86b:1 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, as</b> it <b>overrides</b> even <b>a prohibition of the Torah.</b> How so? <b>As it is stated</b> that God said: <b>“…Saying: If a man sends away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, may he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; and would you yet return to Me, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 3:1). Indeed, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she has been made impure” (Deuteronomy 24:4). The relationship between the Jewish people and the Holy One, Blessed be He, is compared to that between a husband and wife. Just as it is prohibited for an adulterous wife to return to her husband, it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition. |
| Jeremiah 3:3 | it is written: “And you had a prostitute’s forehead” | Arakhin 16a:16 | Finally, the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for an act of brazenness.</b> From where is this derived? <b>Here,</b> with regard to the frontplate, <b>it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), <b>and there,</b> with regard to brazenness, <b>it is written: “And you had a prostitute’s forehead”</b> (Jeremiah 3:3). The statement of Rabbi Anani bar Sason indicates that the robe worn by the High Priest atones for malicious speech, which means that one is not punished by leprosy, as claimed by Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani. |
| Jeremiah 3:3 | as it is stated: “Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no last rain, yet you had a harlot’s forehead, | Taanit 7b:8 | <b>Rav Salla said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said: The rains are withheld only due to impudent</b> people, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no last rain, yet you had a harlot’s forehead,</b> you refused to be ashamed” (Jeremiah 3:3). <b>And Rav Salla said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said,</b> with regard to the same verse: <b>Any man who is insolent will ultimately stumble over</b> the <b>transgression</b> of prostitution, <b>as it is stated: “Yet you had a prostitute’s forehead.” Rav Naḥman said:</b> The verse does not mean that he will commit a sexual transgression in the future; rather, <b>it is known that he has</b> already <b>stumbled over</b> this <b>transgression, as it is stated: “You had,”</b> in the past tense, <b>and it is not stated: You will.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:3 | as it is written: “Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you had a harlot’s forehead, | Yevamot 78b:15 | In the <b>second</b> year of the drought David <b>said to them: Perhaps there are transgressors</b> in sexual matters <b>among you,</b> as this too can lead to drought, <b>as it is written: “Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you had a harlot’s forehead,</b> you refused to be ashamed” (Jeremiah 3:3), which indicates that licentious behavior can lead to a cessation of rainfall. Again <b>they examined</b> the matter, <b>but did not find</b> sinners of this kind either. |
| Jeremiah 3:3 | and with regard to brazenness it is written: “And you had a harlot’s forehead” | Zevachim 88b:8 | The <b>robe</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for malicious speech. From where</b> is this known? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is logical that <b>an item that</b> produces <b>sound,</b> i.e., the robe, which has bells, <b>shall come and atone for an evil sound. And</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for brazenness.</b> This is derived from the fact that <b>with regard to the frontplate it is written: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead”</b> (Exodus 28:38), <b>and with regard to brazenness it is written: “And you had a harlot’s forehead”</b> (Jeremiah 3:3). |
| Jeremiah 3:4 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “You are the intimate friend of my youth” | Chagigah 16a:16 | <b>And “intimate friend” is referring to none other</b> than <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “You are the intimate friend of my youth”</b> (Jeremiah 3:4). <b>Lest you say:</b> Since I am acting in private, <b>who will testify against me? The stones of the house and the beams of the house of</b> each <b>person testify against him, as it is stated: “For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it”</b> (Habakkuk 2:11). |
| Jeremiah 3:12 | “Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return you faithless Israel, says the Lord; I will not frown upon you; for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not bear a grudge forever” | Sanhedrin 110b:8 | <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The members of the ten tribes <b>come to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded,</b> and they shall come who were lost in the land of Assyria and who were dispersed in the land of Egypt, and they shall worship the Lord at the holy mountain in Jerusalem” (Isaiah 27:13). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Here too, <b>Rabbi Akiva abandoned his piety</b> and uncharacteristically interpreted the verses harshly, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the ten tribes: <b>“Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return you faithless Israel, says the Lord; I will not frown upon you; for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not bear a grudge forever”</b> (Jeremiah 3:12). The prophet prophesies about the return of the ten tribes to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Jeremiah 3:14 | “For I have taken you to Myself: And I will take out one of a city, and two of a family” | Sanhedrin 111a:4 | With regard to the verse: <b>“For I have taken you to Myself: And I will take out one of a city, and two of a family”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The meaning of this <b>statement</b> is <b>as it is written,</b> that only individuals will be spared and the rest will be destroyed. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: It is not satisfactory to</b> God, <b>their Master, that you said this about them. Rather,</b> the merit of <b>one from the city causes the entire city</b> to <b>benefit, and</b> the merit of <b>two from a family causes the entire family</b> to <b>benefit</b> and be redeemed. Likewise, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana sat before Rav, and sat and said:</b> The meaning of <b>this statement</b> is <b>as it is written. Rav said to him: It is not satisfactory to</b> God, <b>their Master, that you said this about them. Rather,</b> the merit of <b>one from the city causes the entire city</b> to <b>benefit, and</b> the merit of <b>two from a family causes the entire family</b> to <b>benefit</b> and be redeemed. |
| Jeremiah 3:14 | Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “For I have taken you to Myself; and I will take you one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion” | Sanhedrin 97b:16 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: But isn’t it already stated: “Return to me and I will return to you”</b> (Malachi 3:7)? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “For I have taken you to Myself; and I will take you one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), unconditionally? |
| Jeremiah 3:14 | “Return, you backsliding children” | Yoma 86a:15 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Return, you backsliding children”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that <b>initially</b> when you sinned, it was only because <b>you were backsliding,</b> i.e., rebelling. It was merely an act of immaturity and foolishness and could be ignored as if it had never happened. <b>But it is written: “I will heal your backsliding”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that He will heal the sin from this point onward, and that they are still sinners. He resolved this contradiction, explaining that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where everything is forgiven as if the Jewish people never sinned, it is referring to repentance <b>out of love; there,</b> where the sin is still remembered despite the forgiveness and repentance, it is referring to repentance <b>out of fear.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:14 | for I am a lord to you, and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family” | Yoma 86a:16 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Return, you backsliding children I will heal your backsliding”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that anyone can achieve healing, which is dependent only on repentance. But it also states: “Return, O backsliding children, says the Lord, <b>for I am a lord to you, and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that repentance is available only to certain individuals. He resolved the contradiction and explained that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> it is referring to repentance <b>out of love or fear,</b> which few people achieve; <b>there,</b> it referring is repentance <b>through suffering,</b> as everyone has thoughts of repentance when they suffer. <b>Rabbi Levi said: Great is repentance, as it reaches the heavenly throne, as it is stated: “Return, Israel, to the Lord your God”</b> (Hosea 14:2). This implies that repentance literally reaches to God. |
| Jeremiah 3:19 | which is written: “And give you a pleasant land, the goodliest [ tzvi ] heritage” | Ketubot 112a:13 | § <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And give you a pleasant land, the goodliest [<i>tzvi</i>] heritage”</b> (Jeremiah 3:19)? <b>Why is Eretz Yisrael likened to a deer [<i>tzvi</i>]?</b> This comparison comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>this deer, its skin cannot contain its meat</b> once it has been skinned, <b>so too, Eretz Yisrael cannot contain its fruit</b> once it has been picked, due to the great quantity of the produce. <b>Alternatively, just as this deer is swifter than all the</b> other <b>beasts, so too Eretz Yisrael is swifter to ripen its fruit than all</b> the other <b>countries.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:20 | you have dealt treacherously with Me, house of Israel, says the Lord | Sanhedrin 82a:2 | <b>Rav</b> then <b>remembered</b> that which he learned through <b>tradition</b> and said: <b>“Judah has dealt treacherously,” this</b> is a reference to the sin of <b>idol worship. And likewise it says:</b> But as a wife who treacherously departs her husband, <b>you have dealt treacherously with Me, house of Israel, says the Lord</b> (Jeremiah 3:20). <b>“And an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem,” this</b> is a reference to <b>male homosexual intercourse, and likewise it says: “You shall not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). <b>“As Judah has profaned the sacred [<i>kodesh</i>] of the Lord,” this</b> is a reference to <b>a prostitute, and likewise it says: “There shall be no harlot [<i>kedesha</i>] of the daughters of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). <b>“And has engaged in intercourse with the daughter of a strange god,” this</b> is a reference to <b>one who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children, | Avodah Zarah7b:1 | But if they performed their sins <b>in public,</b> society <b>does not accept them. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where they sinned in private, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where they sinned in public, society <b>accepts</b> them, <b>as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children,</b> I will heal your backslidings” (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the village of Akko says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair,</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, i.e., penitents are accepted, regardless of whether they sinned in public or in private. |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | they are accepted, as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children; | Bekhorot 31a:3 | <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>they are accepted, as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children;</b> I will heal your backslidings” (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the village of Akko says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair,</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, i.e., those who return are accepted in both cases. |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | “Return, rebellious children,” | Chagigah 15a:11 | <b><i>Aḥer</i> asked Rabbi Meir</b> another question, again <b>after he had gone astray. What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Gold and glass cannot equal it; neither shall its exchange be vessels of fine gold”</b> (Job 28:17)? If it is referring to the praise and honor of the Torah, it should have compared it only to gold, not to glass. <b>He said to him:</b> This is referring to <b>words of Torah, which are as difficult to acquire as gilded vessels and vessels of fine gold but are as easy to lose as glass vessels.</b> <i>Aḥer</i> <b>said to him: Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so, but</b> taught as follows: <b>Just as golden vessels and glass vessels have a remedy even when they have broken,</b> as they can be melted down and made into new vessels, <b>so too a Torah scholar, although he has transgressed, has a remedy.</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>you too, return</b> from your ways. <b>He said to him: I have already heard</b> the following declaration <b>behind the</b> dividing <b>curtain,</b> which conceals God from the world: <b>“Return, rebellious children,”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22) <b>apart from <i>Aḥer</i>.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | A Divine Voice went forth saying: “Return, rebellious children” | Chagigah 15a:6 | The Gemara relates: <b>They removed Mitatron</b> from his place in heaven <b>and smote him</b> with <b>sixty rods [<i>pulsei</i>] of fire,</b> so that others would not make the mistake that <i>Aḥer</i> made. <b>They said</b> to the angel: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when you saw</b> Elisha ben Avuya <b>you did not stand before him?</b> Despite this conduct, since Mitatron was personally involved, he <b>was granted permission to erase the merits of <i>Aḥer</i></b> and cause him to stumble in any manner. <b>A Divine Voice went forth saying: “Return, rebellious children”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), <b>apart from <i>Aḥer</i>.</b> |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | Rabbi Eliezer says: If the Jewish people repent they are redeemed, as it is stated: “Return, wayward children, I will heal your iniquities” | Sanhedrin 97b:15 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If the Jewish people repent they are redeemed, as it is stated: “Return, wayward children, I will heal your iniquities”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated:</b> “So says the Lord: <b>You were sold for naught, and without money you shall be redeemed”</b> (Isaiah 52:3)? Rabbi Yehoshua explains: <b>“You were sold for naught”</b> means you were sold <b>for idol worship,</b> which is a sin with no basis. <b>“And without money you shall be redeemed”</b> means you will be redeemed <b>not through repentance and good deeds,</b> but through the will of God. |
| Jeremiah 3:22 | But it is written: “I will heal your backsliding” | Yoma 86a:15 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Return, you backsliding children”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that <b>initially</b> when you sinned, it was only because <b>you were backsliding,</b> i.e., rebelling.

| Jeremiah 3:22 | It is written: “Return, you backsliding children I will heal your backsliding” | Yoma 86a:16 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Return, you backsliding children I will heal your backsliding”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that anyone can achieve healing, which is dependent only on repentance.

| Jeremiah 3:22 | as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children, | Yoma 86a:7 | These are the categories: If <b>one violates a positive</b> mitzva <b>and repents, he is forgiven even before he moves</b> from his place, i.e. immediately, <b>as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children,</b> I will heal your backsliding” (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that when one repents he is immediately forgiven. If <b>one violates a prohibition and repents, repentance suspends</b> his punishment <b>and Yom Kippur atones</b> for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you,</b> to purify you <b>from all your sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). If <b>one commits</b> a transgression that warrants <b><i>karet</i> or</b> a sin punishable by <b>death</b> from the earthly <b>court and</b> then <b>repents, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend</b> his punishment, <b>and suffering absolves</b> and completes the atonement, <b>as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes”</b> (Psalms 89:33). |
| Jeremiah 4:1 | Rabbi Eliezer said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “If you will return, Israel, says the Lord, return to Me” | Sanhedrin 98a:2 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “If you will return, Israel, says the Lord, return to Me”</b> (Jeremiah 4:1), indicating that redemption is contingent upon repentance? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the One Who lives forever that it shall be for a period, periods, and a half; when the crushing of the power of the holy people shall have been completed, all these</b> things shall be finished” (Daniel 12:7), indicating that the time for redemption is set and unrelated to repentance? <b>And Rabbi Eliezer was silent,</b> unable to refute the proof from that verse. |
| Jeremiah 4:3 | it is stated: “Break up for yourselves a fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns” | Pesachim 107b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And although there is no</b> absolute <b>proof for</b> this <b>matter,</b> there <b>is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter,</b> as <b>it is stated: “Break up for yourselves a fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns”</b> (Jeremiah 4:3). This verse teaches that one must undertake preparations to achieve positive results. Similarly, one should eat a small amount in the afternoon to enable him to consume more in the evening. |
| Jeremiah 4:7 | “A lion is gone up from his thicket, | Berakhot 56b:12 | <b>One who sees a dog in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue”</b> (Exodus 11:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Yea, the dogs are greedy”</b> (Isaiah 56:11). <b>One who sees a lion in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “The lion has roared, who will not fear?</b> The Lord God has spoken, who can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“A lion is gone up from his thicket,</b> and a destroyer of nations is set out, gone forth from his place” (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Jeremiah 4:7 | “A roaring lion”; this is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written about him: “The lion has come up from his thicket” | Megillah 11a:4 | <b>Reish Lakish introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear, so is a wicked ruler over a poor people”</b> (Proverbs 28:15). <b>“A roaring lion”; this is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written about him: “The lion has come up from his thicket”</b> (Jeremiah 4:7). <b>“A hungry bear”; this is Ahasuerus, as it is written about him: “And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>And Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>these</b> who are referred to as a bear in the verse <b>are the Persians.</b> They are compared to a bear, <b>as they eat and drink</b> in large quantities <b>like a bear; and they are coated with flesh like a bear; and they grow their hair</b> long <b>like a bear; and they never rest like a bear,</b> whose manner it is to move about from place to place. |
| Jeremiah 4:7 | fear not; but fear Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked who is likened to a lion, as it is stated: “The lion [ arye ] is gone up from its thicket” | Sanhedrin 94b:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t these more</b> than ten? The Gemara answers that in the verse: <b>“Cry with a shrill voice, daughter of Gallim,”</b> it is <b>the prophet who is saying it to the congregation of Israel: “Cry with a shrill voice, daughter of Gallim,” daughter of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who performed mitzvot</b> as numerous <b>as the waves of the sea. “Hearken, Laish”; from this</b> king, Sennacherib, <b>fear not; but fear Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked who is likened to a lion, as it is stated: “The lion [<i>arye</i>] is gone up from its thicket”</b> (Jeremiah 4:7). |
| Jeremiah 4:14 | wash your heart from wickedness, | Rosh Hashanah18a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Can a sentence of a community</b> really <b>be torn up</b> because they have repented? <b>But one verse says:</b> “O Jerusalem, <b>wash your heart from wickedness,</b> that you may be saved” (Jeremiah 4:14), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet the stain of your iniquity is before Me,</b> says the Lord God” (Jeremiah 2:22). <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>here</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>before the sentence,</b> when the heart can still be washed with repentance, whereas <b>there</b> the verse is referring to the time <b>after the sentence,</b> when washing no longer helps, as the sentence cannot be canceled? |
| Jeremiah 4:19 | “My anguish, my anguish, I am in pain. The chambers of my heart. | Berakhot 10b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the word <b>“wall [<i>kir</i>]”</b> in this context? Why did Hezekiah turn his face to a wall? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> This symbolically alludes to the fact that Hezekiah prayed to God <b>from the chambers [<i>kirot</i>] of his heart, as it is stated</b> elsewhere: <b>“My anguish, my anguish, I am in pain. The chambers of my heart.</b> My heart moans within me” (Jeremiah 4:19). |
| Jeremiah 4:22 | “They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge” | Eruvin 26a:7 | With regard to the resolution of this incident, <b>the Exilarch recited</b> the following <b>verse about</b> these Rabbis: <b>“They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22), as on Friday they ruined the arrangement that Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana had made to permit carrying from the house to the pavilion, and the next day all they could do was prove that they had acted improperly the day before and that it was prohibited to carry in the orchard. |

Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> She was <b>like garden saffron [<i>kekurkema derishka</i>],</b> which is the best <b>of its kind.</b> <i>Keren</i> refers to a garden, and <i>pukh</i> means ornament, <b>as it is stated: “Though you enlarge</b> your eyes <b>with paint [<i>pukh</i>],</b> you beautify yourself in vain” (Jeremiah 4:30). |
| Jeremiah 4:30 | a child: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: “And you, spoiled one, what are you doing, that you clothe yourself with scarlet, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you make yourself fair” | Chagigah 15b:1 | <b>a child: Recite your verse to me.

When he questioned the profit of “this,” he was challenging the assertion that “this is my God.” <b>And he denied resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “Behold, I am at the point of death”</b> (Genesis 25:32), indicating that he did not believe in resurrection after death. <b>And he despised the birthright, as it is written: “And Esau despised the birthright”</b> (Genesis 25:34). |
| Jeremiah 5:1 | Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: Jerusalem was not destroyed until trustworthy men ceased to exist in it, as it is stated: “Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in its broad places, if you can find a man, if there is any that acts justly, that seeks truth, and I will pardon her” | Chagigah 14a:18 | The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: Jerusalem was not destroyed until trustworthy men ceased to exist in it, as it is stated: “Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in its broad places, if you can find a man, if there is any that acts justly, that seeks truth, and I will pardon her”</b> (Jeremiah 5:1), implying there were no trustworthy people at that time? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult:</b> |
| Jeremiah 5:1 | And Rava said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because there were no more trustworthy people there, as it is stated: “Roam about the streets of Jerusalem and see, and search its plazas, if you can find a person, who acts justly, who seeks integrity, that I should forgive it” | Shabbat 119b:11 | <b>And Rava said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because there were no more trustworthy people there, as it is stated: “Roam about the streets of Jerusalem and see, and search its plazas, if you can find a person, who acts justly, who seeks integrity, that I should forgive it”</b> (Jeremiah 5:1). The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ketina say: Even at the time of Jerusalem’s failure, trustworthy people did not cease there, as it is stated: “For a man will grab his brother of his father’s house and say: You have a garment.

The use of the word in these verses indicates that “<i>eitan</i>” means something hard, like a rock or a mountain. <b>Others say</b> a different explanation of the word <i>eitan</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that <i>eitan</i> means old? As</b> it <b>is stated: “It is an ancient [<i>eitan</i>] nation, a nation from of old”</b> (Jeremiah 5:15). |
| Jeremiah 5:16 | “Their quiver [ ashpato ] is an open sepulcher, they are all mighty men” | Sotah 42b:12 | The Gemara records a dispute concerning the enemy forces of Nebuchadnezzar. The prophet states: <b>“Their quiver [<i>ashpato</i>] is an open sepulcher, they are all mighty men”</b> (Jeremiah 5:16). <b>Rav and Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi,</b> engaged in a dispute concerning the implication of the verse. <b>One</b> of them <b>said: When they shoot an arrow, they produce heaps</b> and <b>heaps [<i>ashpatot ashpatot</i>] of corpses. And lest you say that</b> they are <b>skilled in</b> the arts of <b>battle</b> but they are not particularly strong, <b>the verse states: “They are all mighty men.” And one</b> of them <b>said: When they perform their needs,</b> i.e., relieve themselves, <b>they produce heaps</b> and <b>heaps [<i>ashpatot ashpatot</i>] of excrement,</b> which indicates they eat heartily, like mighty men. <b>And lest you say it is because they are ill</b> in their <b>intestines, the verse states: “They are all mighty men”</b> and are not ill. |
| Jeremiah 5:17 | your sons and your daughters” | Bava Kamma119a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who robs another</b> of an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i></b> is considered <b>as though he takes his soul from him, as it is stated: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof”</b> (Proverbs 1:19). <b>And it states: “And they shall consume your harvest, and your bread,</b> they shall consume <b>your sons and your daughters”</b> (Jeremiah 5:17). Since they will consume the harvest and bread, it is as though they consume one’s children as well because there will be no food to feed them. |
| Jeremiah 5:22 | I cannot pass, as it is stated: “Will you not fear Me, said the Lord; will you not tremble at My presence? Who has placed the sand for the bound of the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass?” | Bava Batra73a:10 | <b>And the wave raised its voice</b> and shouted <b>to another</b> wave: <b>My friend, did you leave anything in the world that you did not wash away, that I may come and destroy it?</b> The second wave <b>said to it: Go out</b> and <b>see the greatness of your Master,</b> God, as even when there is <b>as much as a string of sand</b> on the land <b>I cannot pass, as it is stated: “Will you not fear Me, said the Lord; will you not tremble at My presence?

But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood, as it is stated: “Your iniquities have turned away</b> these things, and your sins have held back good from you” (Jeremiah 5:25). |
| Jeremiah 6:4 | the ninth, adjacent to nightfall, they set fire to it, and it continuously burned the entire day, as it is stated: “Woe unto us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out” | Taanit 29a:10 | <b>And</b> on <b>the ninth, adjacent to nightfall, they set fire to it, and it continuously burned the entire day, as it is stated: “Woe unto us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out”</b> (Jeremiah 6:4). This verse is interpreted as a prophecy about the evening when the Temple was burned. <b>And this is</b> what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> meant when he <b>said: Had I been</b> alive <b>in that generation, I would have established</b> the fast <b>only on the tenth</b> of Av <b>because most of the Sanctuary was burned on that</b> day. <b>And the Sages,</b> who established the fast on the ninth, how do they respond to that comment? They maintain that it is <b>preferable</b> to mark <b>the beginning of the tragedy.</b> |
| Jeremiah 6:7 | mistreatment, robbery, and idol worship. Mistreatment, as it is stated: “And a plumb line in His hand”; robbery, as it is stated: “Violence and robbery are heard in her, they are before Me continually” | Bava Metzia59a:8 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> There are <b>three</b> sins <b>before</b> whose transgressors <b>the curtain [<i>hapargod</i>]</b> between the world and the Divine Presence <b>is not locked;</b> their sins reach the Divine Presence. They are: Verbal <b>mistreatment, robbery, and idol worship.

| Jeremiah 6:7 | “As a cistern wells with her waters, | Berakhot 56b:13 | <b>One who sees a shave in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment”</b> (Genesis 41:14), which was said with regard to Joseph when he left prison and rose to greatness, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak”</b> (Judges 16:17). <b>One who sees a well in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A well of living waters”</b> (Song of Songs 4:15), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a cistern wells with her waters,</b> so it wells in its wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7). <b>One who sees a reed in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “A bruised reed shall he not break”</b> (Isaiah 42:3), in praise of the Messiah, <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed”</b> (II Kings 18:21), which is a disparaging depiction of Egypt. |
| Jeremiah 6:7 | hakir | Eruvin 104b:4 | <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The term Heker well denotes <b>a well of living water, as it is stated: “As a well keeps its water fresh</b> [<b><i>hakir</i></b>], so she keeps fresh her wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7), i.e., it is a well of spring water. |
| Jeremiah 6:10 | one’s ear, as it is written: “Behold, their ear is dull [ areila ] | Shabbat 108a:7 | Karna also asked: <b>From where</b> is derived <b>that circumcision is</b> performed <b>in that place?</b> Rav answered him: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to circumcision: “And on the eighth day he shall circumcise the flesh of <b>his foreskin [<i>orlato</i>]</b>” (Leviticus 12:3), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to recently planted trees: “And when you come to the land and plant all types of fruit trees, and you shall count the fruit <b>thereof as forbidden [<i>orlato</i>];</b> three years shall it be as forbidden unto you, it shall not be eaten.” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>Just as there</b> the Torah is referring to a tree, which <b>is an item that bears fruit, here, too,</b> in the case of circumcision, <i>orla</i> is referring to <b>an item that bears fruit.</b> He asked him: <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s heart, as it is written: “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of [<i>orlat</i>] your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16)? <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s ear, as it is written: “Behold, their ear is dull [<i>areila</i>]</b> and they cannot listen” (Jeremiah 6:10)? Rav said to him: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> another instance of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i>; and one does not derive</b> the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> the <b>incomplete</b> form <b><i>orlat,</i></b> which modifies another word, as is also the case with the word <i>areila</i>. |
| Jeremiah 6:11 | pour it onto the infants in the street | Shabbat 119b:8 | <b>Rav Hamnuna said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because schoolchildren there were interrupted</b> from studying Torah, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And I am filled with the wrath of God, I cannot contain it, <b>pour it onto the infants in the street</b> and onto the gathering of youths together, for men and women alike will be captured, the elderly along with those of advanced years” (Jeremiah 6:11). Rav Hamnuna explains: <b>What is the reason that</b> the wrath is <b>poured?</b> It is <b>because infants are outside</b> in the streets and are not studying Torah. <br><b>Ulla said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because people had no shame before each other, as it is stated: “They acted shamefully; they have performed abominations, yet they neither were ashamed</b> nor did they know humiliation.

| Jeremiah 6:19 | “Behold I will bring upon these people evil, even the fruit of their thoughts” | Kiddushin 40a:13 | But <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link an evil thought to an action, as it is stated: “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear”</b> (Psalms 66:18). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Behold I will bring upon these people evil, even the fruit of their thoughts”</b> (Jeremiah 6:19)? In the case of an evil <b>thought that produces fruit,</b> i.e., that leads to an action, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, links it to</b> the <b>action</b> and one is punished for the thought as well.

| Jeremiah 6:26 | Jeremiah lamented: “O daughter of My people, gird yourself with sackcloth and roll in ashes; make you mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us” | Gittin 58a:17 | <b>And with regard to her</b> and others like her, <b>Jeremiah lamented: “O daughter of My people, gird yourself with sackcloth and roll in ashes; make you mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us”</b> (Jeremiah 6:26). <b>It is not stated: Upon you, but</b> rather <b>“upon us,”</b> for <b>the spoiler shall come, as it were,</b> both <b>over Me and over you.</b> God Himself shares this pain and His name is also disgraced. |
| Jeremiah 7:4 | Isn’t it written: “The Sanctuary of the Lord, the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Sanctuary of the Lord, are these” | Nazir 32b:5 | <b>Rav Yosef said: If I had been there,</b> when those nazirites arrived, <b>I would have said</b> the following <b>to them,</b> in order to dissolve their vows: <b>Isn’t it written: “The Sanctuary of the Lord, the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Sanctuary of the Lord, are these”</b> (Jeremiah 7:4). <b>This</b> thrice repetition of “Sanctuary of the Lord” is referring to the <b>First Temple and</b> the <b>Second Temple</b> which are destined to be destroyed, leading to a Third Temple. These nazirites should have considered the possibility of the Temple’s destruction, and this can serve as a means of broaching the dissolution of their vows. |
| Jeremiah 7:16 | “And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [ tifga ] Me | Berakhot 26b:7 | <b>Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “And he encountered [<i>vayifga</i>] the place and he slept there</b> for the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11).

Jacob prayed during the evening, after the sun had set. |
| Jeremiah 7:16 | nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation, and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [ tifga ] Me, | Sanhedrin 95b:2 | <b>Alternatively, encounter</b> means <b>nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation, and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [<i>tifga</i>] Me,</b> for I do not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16). |

| Jeremiah 7:29 | “ Gozi ,” is a term of administering an oath? As it is written: “Cut off [ gozi ] your hair and cast it away” | Niddah 31a:1 | <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus is administered an oath on the day of its birth? “Upon You I have relied from birth; <b>You are He Who took me out [<i>gozi</i>] of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word: <b>“<i>Gozi</i>,” is a term of administering an oath? As it is written: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29), which is interpreted as a reference to the vow of a nazirite, who must cut off his hair at the end of his term of naziriteship. |
| Jeremiah 7:29 | states: “Cut off [ gozi ] your hair, and cast it away” | Sotah 45b:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that these <i>tanna’im</i> are like those <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who had a dispute as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where is an embryo formed? From its head, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Out of my mother’s womb You pulled me [<i>gozi</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>And</b> the proof that “<i>gozi</i>” is referring to the head is from the verse that <b>states: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair, and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29). In this verse, the term <i>gozi</i> relates to the hair of the head. <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> An embryo is formed <b>from its navel, and it sends its roots forth.</b> This dispute concerning the initial formation of an embryo also appears to depend on where the main source of life in a person is. |
| Jeremiah 7:29 | and it says: “Cut off [ gozi ] your hair, and cast it away” | Yoma 85a:10 | The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say that</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree about checking for signs of life <b>is like</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree about the formation of the fetus. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From what point is the fetus created?</b> It is <b>from its head, as it is stated: “You are He Who took me [<i>gozi</i>] out of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6), <b>and it says: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair, and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29). These verses suggest that one is created from the head, the place of the hair. <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> A person is created <b>from his navel, and he sends his roots in every direction</b> until he attains the image of a person. The <i>tanna</i> who says that the presence of life is determined based on the nose holds in accordance with the opinion of the <i>tanna</i> who maintains that the formation of a fetus begins with its head. Likewise, the <i>tanna</i> who says the presence of life is determined based on the heart holds in accordance with the opinion of the one who thinks the formation of a fetus begins with its navel. |
| Jeremiah 8:2 | Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written: “They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth” | Yevamot 63b:12 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written: “They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 8:2), <b>and it is written: “And death shall be chosen rather than life”</b> (Jeremiah 8:3). If death will be so indecent that their bodies will not even be buried, why would people choose death over life? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him:</b> The latter verse does not refer to the previously described state of affairs, but rather it means: <b>Death is preferable for the wicked,</b> as it is better <b>that they not live in this world and sin and</b> consequently <b>descend into Gehenna.</b> |

| Jeremiah 8:5 | “Why is this people of Jerusalem slid back in perpetual backsliding?” | Sanhedrin 105a:2 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“Why is this people of Jerusalem slid back in perpetual backsliding?”</b> (Jeremiah 8:5), <b>Rav says: The congregation of Israel answered</b> with <b>a convincing response to the prophet. The prophet said to the Jewish people: Repent,</b> as <b>your ancestors sinned,</b> and <b>where are they? They said</b> to the prophets: <b>And your prophets who did not sin, where are they?</b> They too died, <b>as it is stated: “Your fathers, where are they, and the prophets; do they live forever?”</b> (Zechariah 1:5). The prophet <b>said to</b> the Jewish people: <b>Your ancestors reconsidered and conceded</b> that the admonitions of the prophets were fulfilled, <b>as it is stated: “By my words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,</b> did they not overtake your fathers? And they repented and said: As the Lord of hosts intended to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has He dealt with us” (Zechariah 1:6). |
| Jeremiah 8:16 | did not prevail until he reached Dan, as it is stated: “From Dan the snorting of his horses is heard” | Sanhedrin 96a:5 | With regard to the previous verse: <b>“And he pursued as far as Dan”</b> (Genesis 14:14), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Once that righteous</b> person, Abraham, <b>came to Dan, his strength weakened. He saw</b> through the Divine Spirit <b>that his descendants were destined to worship idols in Dan, as it is stated:</b> “And he fashioned two calves of gold…<b>and he set one in Bethel, and the other one he placed in Dan”</b> (I Kings 12:28–29). <b>And even that wicked</b> person, Nebuchadnezzar, <b>did not prevail until he reached Dan, as it is stated: “From Dan the snorting of his horses is heard”</b> (Jeremiah 8:16). |
| Jeremiah 8:22 | And this is what the prophet said to the Jewish people: “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? | Taanit 4a:8 | Regarding the incident of Jephthah, the Gemara remarks: <b>And this is what the prophet said to the Jewish people: “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?</b> Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not recovered?” (Jeremiah 8:22). This verse alludes to the fact that had he sought a means to do so, Jephthah could have had his vow annulled. |
| Jeremiah 9:4 | lying, as it is stated: “They have taught their tongues to speak lies” | Sukkah 46b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Zeira said: A person should not say to a child: I will give you something, and</b> then <b>not give</b> it <b>to him, because he</b> thereby <b>comes to teach him</b> about <b>lying, as it is stated: “They have taught their tongues to speak lies”</b> (Jeremiah 9:4). One must not accustom a child to fail to honor commitments. |
| Jeremiah 9:4 | commit iniquity, etc.” | Yevamot 63a:13 | <b>When Ḥiyya, his son, grew up, he would reverse</b> the requests Rav asked him to convey <b>to her,</b> so that Rav would get what he wanted. Rav <b>said to</b> his son Ḥiyya: <b>Your mother has improved</b> now that <b>you</b> convey my requests. <b>He said to</b> Rav: <b>It is I who reverse</b> your request <b>to her.</b> Rav <b>said to him: This is</b> an example of the well-known adage <b>that people say:</b> He <b>who comes from you shall teach you wisdom;</b> I should have thought of that idea myself. <b>You,</b> however, <b>should not do so,</b> i.e., reverse my request, <b>as it is stated: “They have taught their tongue to speak lies, they</b> weary themselves to <b>commit iniquity, etc.”</b> (Jeremiah 9:4). If you attribute such a request to me, you will have uttered a falsehood. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | nothing other than the tongue, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit. | Arakhin 15b:14 | <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who speaks malicious speech, the Holy One Blessed be He says</b> about him <b>to Gehenna: I</b> will be <b>on him from above, and you</b> will be <b>on him from below,</b> and together <b>we will judge him</b> and punish him. <b>As it is stated: “Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom”</b> (Psalms 120:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>“arrow”</b> means <b>nothing other than the tongue, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks deceit.</b> One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait for him” (Jeremiah 9:7). |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | nothing other than malicious speech, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; | Arakhin 15b:16 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says: What is the remedy for those who speak malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah, as it is stated: “A soothing tongue is a tree of life,</b> but its perverseness is a broken spirit” (Proverbs 15:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tongue”</b> means <b>nothing other than malicious speech, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow;</b> it speaks deceit” (Jeremiah 9:7). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tree”</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them that lay hold of it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18). <b>And if he is an ignoramus,</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated: “Its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). In other words, one who perverts his tongue with malicious speech should remedy his behavior by cultivating a broken and humble spirit. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow” | Arakhin 15b:22 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Death and life are in the hand of</b> the <b>tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21). <b>Does the tongue have a hand?</b> Rather the verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a hand can kill, so too a tongue can kill. If</b> you were to claim that <b>just as the hand kills only from close by, so too the tongue kills only from close by,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). The tongue kills like an arrow that is fired from a bow, at a great distance. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow” | Arakhin 15b:24 | The Gemara asks: <b>But since it is written: “They have set their mouth against the heavens,</b> and their tongue walks through the earth” (Psalms 73:9), which teaches that malicious speech reaches between heaven and earth, <b>why do I</b> need that which we derived from the verse: <b>“Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), i.e. that a tongue can kill from the distance an arrow flies? The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> a tongue <b>kills</b> in the <b>same</b> manner that <b>an arrow</b> kills. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | But since it is written: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow” | Arakhin 15b:25 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But since it is written: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Death and life are in the hand of the tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21), which merely teaches that a tongue can kill? The Gemara answers: This verse is necessary <b>for</b> a statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: One who wants life</b> can attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> which he can use for speaking appropriately and studying Torah. <b>One who wants death</b> can also attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> by using it for inappropriate and malicious speech. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | As it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened [ shaḥut ] arrow, it speaks deceit; | Chullin 30a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish also holds</b> that <b>we require a clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that slaughter must be clear</b> and obvious? <b>As it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow, it speaks deceit;</b> one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lays wait for him” (Jeremiah 9:7). Just as an arrow clearly enters one part of the body, so too, the slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>] must be clear and obvious. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | as the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened [ shaḥut ] arrow, it speaks deceit” | Chullin 30b:13 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated: If one decapitated the animal in one motion, the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). Just as an arrow is propelled by drawing back the bowstring, so too, slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>] must be performed by drawing the knife across the animal’s neck and not by pressing the knife or striking the neck with the knife. |
| Jeremiah 9:7 | states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaks deceit” | Chullin 30b:14 | Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]</b> the young bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The term <b>“<i>veshaḥat</i>”</b> means <b>nothing other than: And he shall draw</b> the knife across the neck of the animal. <b>And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And King Solomon made two hundred targets <b>of drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> (I Kings 10:16), meaning gold that is smoothed in the manner of goldsmiths. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). |
| Jeremiah 9:9 | “For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing” | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite:</b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall,</b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Jeremiah 9:9 | all have fled and gone” | Shabbat 145b:12 | <b>And here</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> even the animals and birds <b>were exiled? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>no person passed through</b> the land of <b>Judea</b> for <b>fifty-two years, as it is stated: “I will raise crying and wailing for the mountains</b> and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, for they have been burned, with no person passing through, and they do not hear the voice of the cattle, <b>from the bird of the heavens to the beast [<i>behema</i>,</b> spelled <i>beit</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>heh</i>], <b>all have fled and gone”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). <b><i>Behema</i> has a numerical value of fifty-two,</b> alluding to the fact that no one passed through for fifty-two years. From the verse cited in this <i>baraita</i>, it is clear that even the animals and birds were exiled, as it states: “All have fled and gone.” |
| Jeremiah 9:9 | as it is stated: “I will raise crying and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, for they have been burned, with no person passing through. And they do not hear the sound of the cattle; from the bird of the heavens to the beast [ behema ], all have fled and gone” | Yoma 54a:3 | <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: No person passed through</b> the land of <b>Judea</b> for <b>fifty-two years</b> after the destruction of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar, <b>as it is stated: “I will raise crying and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, for they have been burned, with no person passing through.

| Jeremiah 9:11 | which is written: “Who is the wise man, that he may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land been lost | Bava Metzia85a:23 | § The Gemara discusses the topic of the acquisition of Torah knowledge. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who is the wise man, that he may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land been lost</b> and laid waste like a wilderness, so that none passes through?” (Jeremiah 9:11). <b>This matter,</b> i.e., the question: Why has the land been lost, |
| Jeremiah 9:11 | which is written: “Who is the wise man that may understand this, | Nedarim 81a:4 | <b>Ravina says:</b> They are punished <b>because they do not first recite a blessing over the Torah</b> before commencing their studies. <b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who is the wise man that may understand this,</b> and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land is perished and laid waste like a wilderness, so that none passes through” (Jeremiah 9:11)? <b>This matter,</b> the question as to why Eretz Yisrael was destroyed, <b>was asked of the Sages,</b> i.e., “the wise man,” <b>and of the prophets,</b> “he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken,” <b>but they could not explain it.</b> |
| Jeremiah 9:12 | “And the Lord says: Because they have forsaken My Torah which I set before them” | Bava Metzia85b:1 | <b>was stated by the Sages,</b> i.e., the wise man mentioned in the verse, <b>and</b> yet <b>they</b> could <b>not explain it.</b> It <b>was stated by the prophets,</b> i.e., those to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, <b>and</b> yet <b>they</b> could <b>not explain it, until the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself explained it, as it is stated</b> in the next verse: <b>“And the Lord says: Because they have forsaken My Torah which I set before them”</b> (Jeremiah 9:12). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This does not mean <b>that</b> the Jewish people ceased Torah study altogether; rather, <b>they did not recite a blessing on the Torah prior</b> to its study, as they did not regard Torah study as a sacred endeavor. |
| Jeremiah 9:12 | “And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken My Torah | Nedarim 81a:5 | The matter remained a mystery <b>until the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself explained</b> why Eretz Yisrael was laid waste, <b>as it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken My Torah</b> which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, nor walked therein” (Jeremiah 9:12). It would appear that <b>“have not obeyed My voice” is</b> the same as <b>“nor walked therein.” Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The expression “nor walked therein” means <b>that they do not first recite a blessing over the Torah,</b> and they are therefore liable to receive the severe punishments listed in the verse. |
| Jeremiah 9:19 | as it is stated: “And teach your daughters wailing and everyone her neighbor lamentation” | Moed Katan28b:3 | The mishna explains: <b>What is</b> considered <b>wailing?</b> This is <b>when they all wail together</b> simultaneously. And what is considered <b>a lament?</b> This is <b>when one speaks and they all answer after her</b> with a repeated refrain, <b>as it is stated: “And teach your daughters wailing and everyone her neighbor lamentation”</b> (Jeremiah 9:19). |
| Jeremiah 9:20 | as it is written: “For death is come up into our windows” | Bava Kamma60b:5 | <b>At a time</b> when there was a <b>plague, Rava would close the windows</b> of his house, <b>as it is written: “For death is come up into our windows”</b> (Jeremiah 9:20). |
| Jeremiah 9:22 | “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might” | Arakhin 10b:16 | § <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Siloam</b> pool <b>used to spurt</b> forth <b>water through</b> an opening with a diameter <b>like</b> that of <b>an <i>issar</i></b> coin.<b>The king issued a command and they widened</b> the opening <b>so that its waters would increase, but</b> the waters actually <b>decreased. And they</b> subsequently <b>decreased</b> the size of the opening <b>again and it</b> once again <b>spurted</b> forth <b>water</b> as it had before. All this serves <b>to uphold that which is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might”</b> (Jeremiah 9:22), i.e., man should not think that he can accomplish anything he wishes. |
| Jeremiah 9:25 | uncircumcised is used only to name the nations of the world, as it is stated: “For all the nations are uncircumcised, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart” | Nedarim 31b:7 | Conversely, if he said: <b>Benefiting from those who are circumcised</b> is <i>konam</i> <b>for me, he is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit even <b>from uncircumcised Jews and</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from the circumcised of the nations of the world, as</b> the term <b>uncircumcised is used only to name the nations of the world, as it is stated: “For all the nations are uncircumcised, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart”</b> (Jeremiah 9:25), <b>and it says: “And this uncircumcised Philistine shall be”</b> (I Samuel 17:36), <b>and it says: “Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph”</b> (II Samuel 1:20). These verses indicate that ordinary gentiles are referred to as uncircumcised, regardless of whether they are actually circumcised. |
| Jeremiah 9:25 | for all the nations are uncircumcised, | Nedarim 31b:8 | <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: The foreskin is repulsive, as</b> is evident from the fact that <b>the wicked are disgraced through it, as it is stated:</b> “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision: Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness; <b>for all the nations are uncircumcised,</b> but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart” (Jeremiah 9:25), which indicates that there is an element of disgrace associated with the foreskin. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that thirteen covenants were sealed with regard to it,</b> for the word covenant appears thirteen times in the biblical passage that discusses circumcision (Genesis, chapter 17). |
| Jeremiah 10:2 | that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them” | Shabbat 156a:12 | <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: A constellation makes one wise</b> and <b>a constellation makes one wealthy, and there is a constellation for the Jewish people</b> that influences them. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no constellation for the Jewish people</b> that influences them. The Jewish people are not subject to the influence of astrology. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> own <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them”</b> (Jeremiah 10:2). <b>The nations will be dismayed</b> by them, <b>but not the Jewish people.</b> |
| Jeremiah 10:2 | as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them” | Sukkah 29a:12 | The Sages said: <b>There is no nation that is afflicted whose god is not afflicted with it, as it is stated: “And against all the gods of Egypt I will mete out judgment; I am God”</b> (Exodus 12:12). The Gemara adds: <b>When the Jewish people perform God’s will, they</b> need <b>not fear any of these</b> omens, <b>as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them”</b> (Jeremiah 10:2). <b>The nations will be dismayed, but the Jewish people will not be dismayed,</b> provided they do not follow the ways of the nations. |
| Jeremiah 10:8 | which is written: “And with one they are brutish and foolish, the teaching of their vanity is a stock” | Taanit 5a:13 | § <b>And Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And with one they are brutish and foolish, the teaching of their vanity is a stock”</b> (Jeremiah 10:8)? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rabbi Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: There is one</b> transgression <b>that causes the wicked to burn in Gehenna. What is this</b> transgression? <b>Idol worship.</b> This can be proven by a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here: “The teaching of their vanity [<i>hevel</i>] is a stock,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to idols: <b>“They are vanity [<i>hevel</i>], a work of delusion”</b> (Jeremiah 10:15). |
| Jeremiah 10:10 | “And the Lord, God, is True” | Berakhot 14b:1 | <b>“And the Lord, God, is True”</b> (Jeremiah 10:10). |
| Jeremiah 10:13 | clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens” | Berakhot 59a:7 | We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna that <b>over thunder</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> causes <b>thunder? Shmuel said:</b> When the <b>clouds</b> located <b>in the curvature</b> of the firmament collide with the firmament itself, they produce this sound, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook”</b> (Psalms 77:19). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Thunder is the sound of <b>clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Thunder is caused by <b>a powerful lightning bolt that flashes in the cloud and shatters the hailstones. Rav Ashi said:</b> Because the <b>clouds are hollow, and</b> when <b>the wind comes and blows across their mouths,</b> it sounds like <b>wind blowing in the mouth of a jug.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; as lightning flashes, the clouds rumble, and the rain comes.</b> |
| Jeremiah 10:13 | puts in the water and then places the pot on the fire, to fulfill that which is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens” | Megillah 15a:19 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is unlike the attribute of</b> a man of <b>flesh and blood; for</b> it is <b>the attribute of flesh and blood</b> that <b>a man places the pot on the fire and then puts in the water. However, the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> first <b>puts in the water and then places the pot on the fire, to fulfill that which is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13), which he explains as follows: First God set the multitudes of water in place, and afterward He created the heavens to hold the water. |
| Jeremiah 10:15 | “They are vanity, the work of deception [ tatuim ]” | Sanhedrin 92a:19 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who amends</b> the truth <b>in his speech, it is as though he worships idols.</b> As, <b>it is written here,</b> in the verse where Jacob sought to resist taking his father’s blessing from Esau: <b>“And I shall seem to him a deceiver [<i>metate’a</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:12), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“They are vanity, the work of deception [<i>tatuim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 10:15). |
| Jeremiah 10:15 | “They are vanity [ hevel ], a work of delusion” | Taanit 5a:13 | § <b>And Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And with one they are brutish and foolish, the teaching of their vanity is a stock”</b> (Jeremiah 10:8)? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rabbi Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: There is one</b> transgression <b>that causes the wicked to burn in Gehenna.

| Jeremiah 11:11 | “Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape” | Yevamot 63b:7 | The Gemara cites further statements on the same issue. The verse states: <b>“Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape”</b> (Jeremiah 11:11). <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: This is a bad wife whose marriage contract is large.</b> Similarly, with regard to the verse: <b>“The Lord has given me into the hands of those against whom I cannot stand”</b> (Lamentations 1:14), <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥiyya said: This is a bad wife whose marriage contract is large. In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they said this</b> verse is referring to one <b>whose food is dependent on his money.</b> He is forced to purchase his food with cash, as he does not possess land of his own. |
| Jeremiah 11:15 | is Abraham, as it is written: “What has My beloved [ lididi ] to do in My house” | Menachot 53b:1 | In the phrase: <b>Son of <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is Abraham, as it is written: “What has My beloved [<i>lididi</i>] to do in My house”</b> (Jeremiah 11:15). This verse is referring to Abraham, as will be explained. In the phrase: <b>And build <i>yadid</i>, this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is the Temple, as it is written: “How lovely [<i>yedidot</i>] are Your tabernacles”</b> (Psalms 84:2). And with regard to the term in the phrase: <b>For <i>Yadid</i>, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “Let me sing of my Beloved [<i>lididi</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 5:1). |
| Jeremiah 11:16 | a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit” | Berakhot 57a:8 | <b>One who sees olives in a dream,</b> and they were <b>small,</b> it is a sign that <b>his business will flourish, increase and be durable like olives.</b> However, the Gemara adds a caveat, saying that <b>this applies only</b> when he sees the <b>fruit</b> of an olive tree; <b>but,</b> one who sees olive <b>trees,</b> it is a sign that <b>he will have many children, as it is stated: “Your children like olive plants,</b> round about your table” (Psalms 128:3). <b>Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord called your name <b>a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil</b> beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). <b>One who sees palm trees [<i>temarim</i>] in a dream</b> has seen a sign that <b>his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion”</b> (Lamentations 4:22), as the Gemara likens <i>temara</i>, date, to <i>tam ra</i>, evil has ceased. |
| Jeremiah 11:16 | “With the sound of a great tumult [ hamulla ] He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches [ daliyyotav ] are broken” | Menachot 53b:9 | The Gemara analyzes the last part of the same verse: <b>“With the sound of a great tumult [<i>hamulla</i>] He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches [<i>daliyyotav</i>] are broken”</b> (Jeremiah 11:16). <b>Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: From the sound of the words [<i>milleihen</i>] of the spies</b> that Moses sent to Eretz Yisrael and who brought back an evil report, <b>the branches of the Jewish people were broken. As Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The spies said a serious statement at that moment: “They are stronger than us”</b> (Numbers 13:31). <b>Do not read</b> the phrase as: “Stronger <b>than us [<i>mimmenu</i>],”</b> but <b>rather</b> read it as: Stronger <b>than Him [<i>mimmennu</i>],</b> meaning <b>that even the Homeowner,</b> God, <b>is unable to remove His belongings from there, as it were.</b> The spies were speaking heresy and claiming that the Canaanites were stronger than God Himself. |
| Jeremiah 12:5 | “If you have run with the pedestrians, and they have wearied you, how can you contend with horses? And though in a land of peace you feel secure, how will you do in the wild country of the Jordan?” | Sanhedrin 96a:7 | The verse states: <b>“Right would you be, Lord, were I to contend with You; yet will I reason with You: Why does the path of the wicked prosper; why are all who deal treacherously secure? You have planted them, they have also taken root; they grow, they also bring forth fruit”</b> (Jeremiah 12:1–2). <b>What did they respond to</b> Jeremiah from heaven? <b>“If you have run with the pedestrians, and they have wearied you, how can you contend with horses? And though in a land of peace you feel secure, how will you do in the wild country of the Jordan?”</b> (Jeremiah 12:5). |
| Jeremiah 12:7 | “I have given the dearly beloved [ yedidut ] of My soul into the hand of her enemies” | Menachot 53b:2 | <b>In the portion of <i>yadid</i>; this</b> <i>yadid</i> <b>is</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin,</b> in whose territory the Temple was built, <b>as it is stated</b> that Moses blessed Benjamin in the following terms: <b>“Of Benjamin he said: The beloved [<i>yedid</i>] of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:12). <b>And let <i>yedidim</i> achieve atonement through it; these</b> <i>yedidim</i> <b>are the Jewish people, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“I have given the dearly beloved [<i>yedidut</i>] of My soul into the hand of her enemies”</b> (Jeremiah 12:7). |
| Jeremiah 12:8 | “My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest. She has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her” | Taanit 16b:2 | The Gemara cites a verse in relation to the prayer leader: <b>“My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest. She has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her”</b> (Jeremiah 12:8). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“She has uttered her voice against me”? Mar Zutra bar Toviyya said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say Rabbi Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This is an unworthy prayer leader who descends before the ark.</b> When this person calls out to God, He thinks, so to speak: I hate the sound of his prayer. |
| Jeremiah 12:9 | states: “Is My inheritance to Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about?” | Zevachim 119a:10 | <b>And</b> similarly, the verse that relates a prophecy with regard to Jerusalem <b>states:</b> “I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My inheritance…<b>My inheritance has become to Me as a lion in the forest”</b> (Jeremiah 12:7–8). <b>And</b> additionally, in that same prophecy the verse <b>states: “Is My inheritance to Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about?”</b> (Jeremiah 12:9). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> |
| Jeremiah 12:14 | in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, | Berakhot 8a:5 | Continuing to extol communal prayer, <b>Reish Lakish said: One who has a synagogue</b> nearby <b>in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,</b> behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them” (Jeremiah 12:14). One who only touches, but does not enter the place of prayer, My inheritance, is considered an evil neighbor. <b>And furthermore,</b> he is punished in that <b>he causes himself and his children</b> to go into <b>exile, as it is stated: “Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them.”</b> |
| Jeremiah 13:15 | “Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud, | Sotah 5a:2 | § The Gemara previously discussed the impropriety of the trait of arrogance. Now the Gemara discusses the source of its prohibition. <b>From where is the warning</b> derived, i.e., what is the source prohibiting the behavior <b>of the arrogant? Rava says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> The source is from the verse: <b>“Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud,</b> for the Lord has spoken” (Jeremiah 13:15). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the warning is <b>from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:14), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that same passage: <b>“Beware lest you forget the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:11). |
| Jeremiah 13:17 | “But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret [ bemistarim ] for your pride” | Chagigah 5b:10 | The verse states: <b>“But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret [<i>bemistarim</i>] for your pride”</b> (Jeremiah 13:17). <b>Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has a place</b> where He cries, <b>and its name is Mistarim. What</b> is the meaning of <b>“for your pride”? Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> God cries <b>due to the pride of the Jewish people, which was taken from them and given to</b> the gentile <b>nations. Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> He cries <b>due to the pride of the kingdom of Heaven,</b> which was removed from the world. |
| Jeremiah 13:17 | “And my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive” | Chagigah 5b:13 | The verse continues: <b>“And my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive”</b> (Jeremiah 13:17). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Why these three</b> references to <b>tears</b> in the verse? <b>One</b> is <b>for the First Temple; one</b> is <b>for the Second Temple; and one</b> is <b>for the Jewish people who were exiled from their place. And there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The last <b>one</b> is <b>for</b> the unavoidable <b>dereliction</b> of the study of <b>Torah</b> in the wake of the exile. |
| Jeremiah 13:23 | as it is written: “Can a Cushite change his skin, or a leopard its spots [ ḥavarburotav ]?” | Shabbat 107b:4 | <b>Levi raised a dilemma before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a wound is</b> defined as something <b>irreversible?</b> He answered him that it is derived <b>as it is written: “Can a Cushite change his skin, or a leopard its spots [<i>ḥavarburotav</i>]?”</b> (Jeremiah 13:23). The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does <b><i>ḥavarburotav</i></b> mean? <b>If you say that they are spotted marks</b> on the leopard’s skin, <b>that</b> phrase: <b>Or a leopard its spots, should</b> have been: <b>Or a leopard its colors. Rather,</b> <i>ḥavarburotav</i> means wounds, and they are <b>similar to</b> the skin of <b>a Cushite: Just like the skin of a Cushite will not change</b> its color to white, <b>so too a wound</b> is something that <b>does not reverse.</b> |
| Jeremiah 14:1 | “The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts” | Taanit 15a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The prayer leader <b>did not need to recite</b> the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i></b> passages. <b>Rather, he recites instead of them</b> the passage beginning with: <b>“If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence”</b> (I Kings 8:37), followed by the verse <b>“The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts”</b> (Jeremiah 14:1). |

| Jeremiah 15:2 | said to him: As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, when they say to you: To where shall we depart? Then you shall tell them: So says the Lord: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for famine, to famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity” | Bava Batra8b:2 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari:</b> Concerning <b>this matter that the Sages stated, that redeeming captives is a great mitzva, from where is</b> it derived?

| Jeremiah 15:4 | verse, as it is stated: “And I will make them into a horror for all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah” | Sanhedrin 102b:20 | § The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Manasseh has a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And he prayed to him and He was entreated of him,</b> and heard his supplication and brought him back to Jerusalem unto his kingdom” (II Chronicles 33:13). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, who disagree with regard to whether Manasseh has a share in the World-to-Come, <b>interpreted one</b> and the same <b>verse, as it is stated: “And I will make them into a horror for all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah”</b> (Jeremiah 15:4). One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>“on account of Manasseh”</b> means that the Jewish people will be judged harshly, <b>as</b> ultimately, one as wicked as Manasseh <b>repented, and they did not do</b> so. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that |
| Jeremiah 15:9 | courts committed idol worship in it, and they are these: Jeroboam, son of Nevat; and Baasa, son of Ahijah; and Ahab, son of Omri; and Jehu, son of Nimshi; and Pekah, son of Remaliah; and Menahem, son of Gadi; and Hoshea, son of Elah, as it is stated: “She who has given birth to seven languishes; her spirit droops; her sun is gone down while it was yet day, she is ashamed and confounded” | Gittin 88a:16 | § The Gemara cites another derivation from this verse. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The first <b>destruction</b> of <b>Eretz Yisrael did not</b> occur <b>until seven</b> dynasties and their <b>courts committed idol worship in it, and they are these: Jeroboam, son of Nevat; and Baasa, son of Ahijah; and Ahab, son of Omri; and Jehu, son of Nimshi; and Pekah, son of Remaliah; and Menahem, son of Gadi; and Hoshea, son of Elah, as it is stated: “She who has given birth to seven languishes; her spirit droops; her sun is gone down while it was yet day, she is ashamed and confounded”</b> (Jeremiah 15:9). |
| Jeremiah 15:19 | If you return, and I bring you back, you shall stand before Me” | Bava Metzia85a:16 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi exert himself <b>so much</b> to save these wayward sons? The Gemara answers: It is because of <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who teaches Torah to the son of another merits to sit</b> and study <b>in the heavenly academy, as it is stated:</b> “Therefore so says the Lord: <b>If you return, and I bring you back, you shall stand before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 15:19). This verse, which is addressed to Jeremiah, indicates that if he is able to cause the Jewish people to return to God, he himself will be brought to stand before God. |
| Jeremiah 16:4 | “They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth” | Sanhedrin 46b:14 | The Gemara proposes another proof: Jeremiah pronounced a curse upon the wicked, saying: <b>“They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 16:4), which proves that when no curse has been pronounced, the dead should be buried. The Gemara rejects this proof: From here, too, there is no proof that it is a mitzva to bury the dead, as Jeremiah cursed the wicked, saying <b>that they would deviate from the</b> general <b>custom</b> and not be buried. Due to all these difficulties, Rav Ḥama was unable to adduce incontrovertible proof that there is a mitzva to bury the dead. |
| Jeremiah 16:4 | “They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried” | Sanhedrin 46b:19 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the curse pronounced by Jeremiah upon the wicked: <b>“They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried”</b> (Jeremiah 16:4), which indicates that it is not on account of atonement that burial is required, as were that the case the wicked are certainly in need of atonement, and therefore they should be buried. The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as Jeremiah’s intention might be <b>that</b> the wicked <b>should not achieve atonement.</b> Therefore, the question of whether burial is necessary in order to prevent disgrace or achieve atonement remains unresolved. |
| Jeremiah 16:4 | “They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried” | Sanhedrin 46b:23 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the curse pronounced by Jeremiah upon the wicked: <b>“They shall not be eulogized, nor shall they be buried”</b> (Jeremiah 16:4). If you say that a eulogy is delivered due to the honor of the living, why should the wicked not be eulogized, as perhaps they are survived by righteous people who are worthy of this honor? The Gemara answers: <b>It is not satisfactory to the righteous when they are honored through the wicked,</b> and therefore they prefer that a eulogy not be delivered for their wicked relatives. |
| Jeremiah 16:5 | both kindness and mercy” | Bava Batra10a:11 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: All</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that Jews perform in this world</b> make <b>great peace and</b> are <b>great intercessors between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, enter not into a house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them, for I have taken away My peace from this people,</b> says the Lord, <b>both kindness and mercy”</b> (Jeremiah 16:5). <b>“Kindness”; this</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness. “Mercy”; this</b> is referring to acts of <b>charity.</b> This indicates that when there is kindness and mercy, God is at peace with His people. |
| Jeremiah 16:5 | What is a marzeiḥa ? A mourner, as it is written: “For so says the Lord: Enter not into the house of mourning [ marze’aḥ | Ketubot 69b:1 | <b>how the incident itself happened.</b> What are the particulars of your exchange that brought about this end result? <b>He said to him: Such and such was</b> the <b>incident,</b> and Rav Anan related the details to Mar Ukva. <b>He said to him: A man who does not know what a <i>marzeiḥa</i> is sends</b> a letter <b>to Rav Huna</b> addressing him as <b>Huna, our friend?</b> It is not your place to take such liberties in your correspondence with him, and Rav Huna was justifiably offended. The Gemara explains: <b>What is a <i>marzeiḥa</i>? A mourner, as it is written: “For so says the Lord: Enter not into the house of mourning [<i>marze’aḥ</i></b>], neither go to lament, neither bemoan them” (Jeremiah 16:5). |
| Jeremiah 16:13 | The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [ ḥanina ]” | Sanhedrin 98b:14 | Apropos the Messiah, the Gemara asks: <b>What is his name? The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come”</b> (Genesis 49:10). <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [<i>yinnon</i>] as long as the sun;</b> and may men bless themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [<i>ḥanina</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 16:13). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>] that should relieve my soul is far from me”</b> (Lamentations 1:16). <b>And the Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 53:4). |
| Jeremiah 17:2 | “Like the memory of their sons are their altars, | Sanhedrin 63b:20 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya raises an objection</b> to this statement from the following verse: <b>“Like the memory of their sons are their altars,</b> and their Asherim are by the leafy trees, upon the high hills” (Jeremiah 17:2). <b>And Rabbi Elazar says</b> that this means that the Jewish people would recall their idol worship <b>like a person who misses his child.</b> This interpretation indicates that they were truly attached to idol worship. |
| Jeremiah 17:8 | as it is stated: “For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out its roots by the river [ yuval ], | Bekhorot 55b:4 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Yuval is the name of</b> the Euphrates River where it emerges from Eden, <b>as it is stated: “For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out its roots by the river [<i>yuval</i>],</b> and shall not see when heat comes, but its foliage shall be luxuriant; and shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit” (Jeremiah 17:8). <b>And why is it named Euphrates [<i>perat</i>]? Because its waters are fruitful [<i>parim</i>] and multiply</b> without the need for rainfall. |
| Jeremiah 17:11 | It is written here: “As the pheasant that broods over young that he has not brought forth” | Chullin 140b:9 | § The mishna teaches: With regard to the case of <b>a male pheasant</b> that rests upon the eggs of its species, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send away the pheasant, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from sending it away. With regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, a verbal analogy between <b>brooding</b> stated with regard to a male pheasant and <b>brooding</b> with regard to a female bird <b>comes</b> to indicate that the resting of a male pheasant upon its eggs is considered an effective resting. <b>It is written here: “As the pheasant that broods over young that he has not brought forth”</b> (Jeremiah 17:11), <b>and it is written elsewhere</b> about a female bird: “There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, <b>and hatch, and brood under her shadow”</b> (Isaiah 34:15). Just as a female bird broods over its nest, so too, a male pheasant broods over a nest. Therefore, one is required to send away the male bird from the nest as well. |
| Jeremiah 17:12 | as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning, | Nedarim 39b:10 | <b>The Temple</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning,</b> in the place of our Temple” (Jeremiah 17:12). |
| Jeremiah 17:12 | as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning, in the place of our Sanctuary” | Pesachim 54a:11 | <b>The Throne of Glory and the Temple</b> were created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning, in the place of our Sanctuary”</b> (Jeremiah 17:12). <b>The name of Messiah</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written</b> in the chapter discussing the Messiah: <b>“May his name endure forever; his name existed before the sun”</b> (Psalms 72:17). The name of Messiah already existed before the creation of the sun and the rest of the world. This <i>baraita</i> states that Gehenna was created before the world was created and not during twilight before the first Shabbat. |
| Jeremiah 17:12 | Throne of Glory, on High from the beginning [ merishon ], the place of our Temple” | Pesachim 5a:15 | The <i>tanna</i> provides the sources for his statement. <b>To eradicate the descendants of Esau, as it is written: “And the first [<i>harishon</i>] came forth red, all over like a hairy mantle;</b> and they called his name Esau” (Genesis 25:25). <b>And to the construction of the Temple, as it is written:</b> “The <b>Throne of Glory, on High from the beginning [<i>merishon</i>], the place of our Temple”</b> (Jeremiah 17:12). <b>And</b> the Jewish people were also entitled <b>to the name of Messiah, as it is written: “A harbinger [<i>rishon</i>] to Zion</b> I will give: <b>Behold, behold them;</b> and to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings” (Isaiah 41:27). However, <i>harishon</i> stated with regard to Passover is referring to the day before the Festival. |
| Jeremiah 17:13 | And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God” | Yoma 85b:8 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya taught</b> that point from the verse: <b>“From all your sins you shall be cleansed before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 16:30). For <b>transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones;</b> however, for <b>transgressions between a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases</b> the <b>other</b> person. In conclusion, <b>Rabbi Akiva said: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you?</b> It is <b>your Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified”</b> (Ezekiel 36:25). <b>And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God”</b> (Jeremiah 17:13). <b>Just as a ritual bath purifies the impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies Israel.</b> |
| Jeremiah 17:18 | with regard to the wicked, it is stated: “And destroy them with double destruction” | Chagigah 15a:10 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>With regard to the righteous, it is stated: “Therefore in their land they shall possess double”</b> (Isaiah 61:7); whereas <b>with regard to the wicked, it is stated: “And destroy them with double destruction”</b> (Jeremiah 17:18); therefore, each receives a double portion. |
| Jeremiah 17:22 | carrying out on a Festival, as it is written: “Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat day” | Beitzah 12a:7 | <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat,</b> but <b>there are no</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> nor a prohibition against <b>carrying out on a Festival, as it is written: “Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat day”</b> (Jeremiah 17:22), from which Beit Hillel inferred: <b>On Shabbat, yes,</b> carrying from one domain to another is indeed prohibited; <b>on a Festival, no,</b> it is not prohibited. According to this explanation, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about whether a prohibited labor that is permitted for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival is also permitted when it does not serve that purpose. |
| Jeremiah 17:22 | isn’t it written: “Neither carry a burden out of your houses | Horayot 4a:18 | The Gemara offers proof against the statement of Rav Yehuda by citing Shmuel. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: The judges are liable if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who carries out</b> objects <b>from</b> the private <b>domain to</b> the public <b>domain</b> is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> should they be liable in that case? With regard to <b>carrying out</b> into the public domain, <b>isn’t it written: “Neither carry a burden out of your houses</b> on Shabbat” (Jeremiah 17:22), and the Sadducees agree to that prohibition. |
| Jeremiah 17:27 | and I will light a fire in its gates and it will consume the palaces of Jerusalem and it will not be extinguished” | Shabbat 119b:6 | <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel, said in the name of Rav: Fire is only found in a place where there is desecration of Shabbat, as it is stated: “And if you do not heed Me to sanctify the day of Shabbat, and to refrain from carrying burdens</b> and come to the gates of Jerusalem on the day of Shabbat, <b>and I will light a fire in its gates and it will consume the palaces of Jerusalem and it will not be extinguished”</b> (Jeremiah 17:27). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>And it will not be extinguished? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Fire will break out <b>at a time when people are not found to extinguish it. Abaye said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because people desecrated the Shabbat in it, as it is stated: “And from My <i>Shabbatot</i> they averted their eyes, and I was profaned among them”</b> (Ezekiel 22:26). Several punishments were decreed to befall Jerusalem as punishment for this transgression. |
| Jeremiah 18:3 | As it is written: “So I went down to the potter’s shop, and behold, he was at his work on the wheels [ ovnayim ]” | Sotah 11b:15 | <b>And there are those who say</b> an alternative explanation for <i>ovnayim</i>: <b>As it is written: “So I went down to the potter’s shop, and behold, he was at his work on the wheels [<i>ovnayim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 18:3). <b>Just as this potter</b> sits so that one <b>thigh</b> is <b>here and</b> one <b>thigh</b> is <b>there and the block</b> upon which he works <b>is in the middle, so too, a woman</b> giving birth also has one <b>thigh here and</b> one <b>thigh there and the newborn is in the middle.</b> |
| Jeremiah 18:6 | it is written: “Behold, like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel” | Berakhot 32a:3 | <b>One</b> is the verse just mentioned in which <b>it is written: “Those whom I have dealt in wickedness.” And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written: “Behold, like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel”</b> (Jeremiah 18:6). <b>And one</b> is the verse in which <b>it is written:</b> “And I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will place within you, <b>and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh”</b> (Ezekiel 36:26). These three verses indicate that God influences a person’s decisions, and therefore one does not have sole responsibility for his actions. |
| Jeremiah 18:6 | And one, as it is written: “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you | Sukkah 52b:9 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not for these three verses</b> that follow that indicate that God controls people’s hearts, <b>the legs of the enemies of</b> the <b>Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>would have collapsed,</b> unable to withstand the repercussions of their sins. <b>One, as it is written: “And her that I corrupted,”</b> indicating God’s regret for doing so. <b>And one, as it is written: “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you</b> in My hand, O house of Israel” (Jeremiah 18:6). <b>And the other</b> verse: <b>“And I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh”</b> (Ezekiel 36:26), indicating that the matter is not solely in human hands, but in the hands of God as well. |
| Jeremiah 18:22 | “For they have dug a pit to trap me and they have set snares for my feet” | Bava Kamma16b:20 | The Gemara cites another dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: Jeremiah requested of God to punish those who hounded him: <b>“For they have dug a pit to trap me and they have set snares for my feet”</b> (Jeremiah 18:22). In what way did they dig a pit to trap him? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a woman who had engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah [<i>zona</i>]. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: They cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman.</b> |
| Jeremiah 18:23 | which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal thus with them in the time of Your anger” | Bava Batra9b:11 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, sends him people who are deserving of charity, so that he will reap</b> his just <b>reward for</b> helping <b>them.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> It serves <b>to exclude Rabba’s homiletical interpretation</b> of a different verse, <b>as Rabba taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal thus with them in the time of Your anger”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23)? The prophet <b>Jeremiah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when</b> those wicked men who pursued me <b>subdue their inclinations and seek to perform</b> acts of <b>charity before You, cause them to stumble upon</b> dishonest <b>people who are not deserving</b> of charity, <b>so that they will not receive reward</b> for coming to their assistance. |
| Jeremiah 18:23 | that which is written: “You, Lord, know all their plans to kill me” | Bava Kamma16b:22 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman, this is</b> consistent with <b>that which is written: “You, Lord, know all their plans to kill me”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23). By claiming he engaged in intercourse with a married woman, they implicated him in a prohibition punishable by the death penalty. <b>But according to the one who says that they suspected him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a <i>zona</i>, what</b> did he mean by saying <b>“to kill</b> me” when there is no court-imposed capital punishment for doing so? The Gemara answers: Jeremiah was referring to the fact <b>that they cast him into a pit of mire.</b> |
| Jeremiah 18:23 | which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger” | Bava Kamma16b:23 | <b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23)? It means that <b>Jeremiah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even at a time when they</b> try to <b>perform</b> acts of <b>charity, make them stumble</b> by ensuring that they do so <b>with people who are unworthy</b> of charity <b>in order that they should not receive</b> the <b>reward for</b> helping <b>them.</b> |
| Jeremiah 19:5 | which I did not command, and I did not speak, nor did it come into My heart” | Taanit 4a:9 | <b>And it is written,</b> with regard to human sacrifice: “And they have also built the high places of the Ba’al, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Ba’al, <b>which I did not command, and I did not speak, nor did it come into My heart”</b> (Jeremiah 19:5). |
| Jeremiah 21:12 | judges and is judged, as it is written: “O house of David, so says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning” | Sanhedrin 19a:15 | § The mishna teaches: <b>A king does not judge</b> and is not judged. <b>Rav Yosef says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the kings of Israel,</b> who were violent and disobedient of Torah laws, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the kings of the house of David,</b> the king <b>judges and is judged, as it is written: “O house of David, so says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning”</b> (Jeremiah 21:12). <b>If they do not judge him, how can he judge? But isn’t it written: “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together [<i>hitkosheshu vakoshu</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 2:1), <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> This verse teaches a moral principle: <b>Adorn [<i>kashet</i>] yourself</b> first, <b>and then adorn others,</b> i.e., one who is not subject to judgment may not judge others. Since it is understood from the verse in Jeremiah that kings from the Davidic dynasty can judge others, it is implicit that they can also be judged. |
| Jeremiah 21:12 | which is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor” | Sanhedrin 7b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, and some say Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor”</b> (Jeremiah 21:12)? <b>And</b> is it <b>so</b> that a court <b>may judge in the morning, and all</b> the rest of <b>the day</b> a court <b>may not judge?</b> Why does the verse specifically relate to judging in the morning? <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is: <b>If the matter is as clear to you as the morning, state</b> the verdict; <b>and if not, do not state it. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> says this principle may be derived <b>from here: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>If the matter is</b> as <b>clear to you as</b> the fact <b>that your sister is forbidden to you, state it, and if not, do not state it.</b> |
| Jeremiah 21:12 | As it is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings” | Shabbat 55a:3 | And from where is it derived that this responsibility is incumbent upon the house of the Exilarch? <b>As it is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings”</b> (Jeremiah 21:12). The Exilarch is a direct descendant of the house of David. |
| Jeremiah 22:9 | “And then they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God | Sanhedrin 38b:12 | <b>Rav Naḥman says: He was a denier of the fundamental principle</b> of belief in God. It <b>is written here:</b> “And they like men [<i>adam</i>] <b>have transgressed the covenant,” and</b> it <b>is written there: “He has broken My covenant,”</b> and it is written in a third verse: <b>“And then they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God</b> and worshipped other gods and served them” (Jeremiah 22:9). |
| Jeremiah 22:10 | weep sore for him that goes away” | Bava Batra116a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> this cannot be, as <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would not go to a house of mourning [<i>bei tamya</i>]</b> to console the bereaved so as not to interrupt his studies, <b>except to the house of one who died without any sons, as it is written:</b> “Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but <b>weep sore for him that goes away”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10), <b>and Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that the verse is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>departs</b> from this world <b>without</b> leaving behind <b>a male child.</b> From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would console specifically one who died without leaving a son, it is apparent that he does not hold that God is full of wrath toward such an individual. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is</b> the Sage <b>who says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student.</b> |
| Jeremiah 22:10 | “Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him” | Moed Katan27b:15 | The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that states: <b>“Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10): <b>“Weep not for the dead”</b> is referring to <b>excessive</b> mourning; <b>“neither bemoan him” more than the</b> appropriate <b>measure</b> of time. <b>How so?</b> What is the appropriate measure? <b>Three days for weeping, and seven for eulogizing, and thirty for</b> the prohibition against <b>ironing</b> clothing <b>and for</b> the prohibition against <b>cutting hair. From this</b> point <b>forward the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Do not be more merciful with</b> the deceased <b>than I am.</b> If the Torah commands one to mourn for a certain period of time, then that suffices. |
| Jeremiah 22:10 | go to a house of mourning only for one who passed away without children, as it is written: “Weep sore for him that goes away; for he shall return [ yashuv ] no more, nor see his native land” | Moed Katan27b:16 | It is stated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Weep sore for him that goes away.” Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who leaves</b> the world <b>without children</b> to survive him, since mourning for him is much more intense. It was related that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> would <b>go to a house of mourning only for one who passed away without children, as it is written: “Weep sore for him that goes away; for he shall return [<i>yashuv</i>] no more, nor see his native land”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10). <b>Rav Huna</b> disagreed with the interpretation of the verse and <b>said:</b> “Him that goes” <b>is</b> one <b>who committed a transgression and</b> then <b>repeated it,</b> i.e., one who sins constantly and does not repent [<i>yashav</i>], and therefore loses his portion in the World-to-Come, his “native land.” |
| Jeremiah 22:19 | “He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth | Sanhedrin 104a:9 | <b>He said: This is</b> no doubt <b>the skull of Jehoiakim, as it is written in his</b> regard: <b>“He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth</b> beyond the gates of Jerusalem” (Jeremiah 22:19). The fulfillment of this verse is exemplified in the inability to bury him. Rabbi Perida’s grandfather <b>said: He is a king, and it is inappropriate to display contempt for it. He wrapped</b> the skull <b>in silk and placed it in a box. His wife saw</b> the box and <b>thought: This was</b> the skull <b>of</b> his <b>first wife, as he is not forgetting her. She ignited the oven and incinerated</b> the skull. When she informed her husband what she had done, he said: <b>That is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> on the skull: <b>This and yet another.</b> Not only was his corpse discarded in a demeaning manner and not buried, but his skull was incinerated. That ordeal atoned for some of his transgressions, and he received a share in the World-to-Come. |
| Jeremiah 22:19 | He said: This is the skull of Jehoiakim, as it is written in his regard: “With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried, drawn and cast beyond the gates of Jerusalem” | Sanhedrin 82a:5 | § The Gemara cites another of Rav Ḥiyya bar Avuya’s statements. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avuya says:</b> It was <b>written on the skull of Jehoiakim</b> king of Judea: <b>This and yet another,</b> indicating that he will suffer a punishment in addition to the punishment that he already received. The Gemara relates: <b>The grandfather of Rabbi Perida,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avuya, <b>found a skull that was cast at the gates of Jerusalem, and upon it was written: This and yet another. He buried it, and it then emerged [<i>navug</i>]</b> from beneath the soil. <b>He buried it and it then emerged</b> from beneath the soil again. <b>He said: This is the skull of Jehoiakim, as it is written in his regard: “With the burial of a donkey he shall be buried, drawn and cast beyond the gates of Jerusalem”</b> (Jeremiah 22:19). He will find no rest in a grave. |
| Jeremiah 22:29 | “Oh land, land, land hear the word of the Lord” | Chullin 127a:14 | §Apropos the region surrounding Neresh, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The people of the city of <b>Neresh</b> shall be placed <b>under excommunication,</b> as they are all wicked, including <b>its fat, its hide, and its tail,</b> i.e., all types of people, both old and young. The Gemara continues to discuss Neresh. The verse states: <b>“Oh land, land, land hear the word of the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 22:29). <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This verse is appropriate with regard to the inhabitants of Neresh, as <b>Neresh does not want to listen to the word of the Lord.</b> |
| Jeremiah 22:30 | “So says the Lord: Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling anymore in Judah” | Sanhedrin 37b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Exile atones for all</b> transgressions and renders a sinner like a new person, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning the king Jeconiah, a descendant of King David: <b>“So says the Lord: Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling anymore in Judah”</b> (Jeremiah 22:30). <b>And after</b> Jeconiah <b>was exiled it is written: “And the sons of Jeconiah, the same is Assir, Shealtiel his son”</b> (I Chronicles 3:17). The verse employs the plural “sons of” although he had only one son, Shealtiel. <b>“Assir,”</b> literally, prisoner, teaches <b>that his mother conceived him in prison. “Shealtiel,”</b> literally, planted by God, teaches <b>that God planted him in a way atypical of</b> most <b>plants [<i>hanishtalin</i>],</b> i.e., people. It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that a woman does not conceive</b> when she is <b>standing</b> during sexual intercourse, |
| Jeremiah 23:6 | as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness” | Bava Batra75b:4 | With regard to <b>the righteous, this</b> is <b>as we</b> have just <b>said.</b> With regard to <b>the Messiah,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness”</b> (Jeremiah 23:6). With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there [<i>shamma</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 48:35). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b>“there” [<i>shamma</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: The Lord is <b>its name [<i>shemah</i>]. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will</b> have the name: <b>Holy, recited before them, as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy”</b> (Isaiah 4:3). |
| Jeremiah 23:9 | which is written: “Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine has overcome, due to the Lord and due to His sacred words” | Sanhedrin 96a:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>So too, you,</b> Jeremiah: <b>And if with regard to</b> the <b>reward</b> for <b>four paces that I compensated that wicked person,</b> Nebuchadnezzar, <b>who ran in My honor, you are astonished</b> at its magnitude, <b>when I compensate Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who ran before Me like horses</b> throughout their lives, <b>all the more so</b> will their reward be great. This teaches the potency of even a minor mitzva. <b>That is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine has overcome, due to the Lord and due to His sacred words”</b> (Jeremiah 23:9). |
| Jeremiah 23:10 | as it is written: “For because of swearing the land mourns” | Kiddushin 13a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this punishment is not administered <b>until they perform all of them,</b> i.e., only if they commit all of the sins mentioned in the verse, including taking false oaths, committing murder, and stealing. The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “For because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10). This verse teaches that on account of taking false oaths alone the world can be destroyed, from which it may be inferred that each these acts on its own is enough to warrant destruction. |
| Jeremiah 23:10 | not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns” | Shevuot 39a:21 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from him,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from the entire world, as it is stated: “Swearing and lying,</b> and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery,” <b>and it is written: “Therefore, the land mourns.”</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn. |
| Jeremiah 23:10 | not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns” | Shevuot 39a:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all of</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that taking a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn. <b>And it is</b> similarly <b>written</b> in the verse in Hosea: <b>“Therefore, the land mourns, and everyone who dwells therein languishes.”</b> Both verses employ a term of mourning. |
| Jeremiah 23:19 | Rav said: Upon the heads of the wicked in Gehenna, as it is stated: “Behold, a storm of the Lord has gone forth in fury, a whirling storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked” | Chagigah 13b:14 | The Gemara asks: <b>From where does</b> this river <b>flow?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>From the perspiration of the divine creatures. And where does</b> it <b>flow to? Rav Zutra bar Toviya said</b> that <b>Rav said: Upon the heads of the wicked in Gehenna, as it is stated: “Behold, a storm of the Lord has gone forth in fury, a whirling storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked”</b> (Jeremiah 23:19). <b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The river flows <b>over those who were snatched away,</b> i.e., the generations that were never created, <b>as it is stated: “Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream”</b> (Job 22:16), implying that the River Dinur flows over them. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon HeḤasid said</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>These</b> people “who were snatched away” are <b>those nine hundred and seventy-four generations that were snatched away;</b> they were to have <b>been created</b> |
| Jeremiah 23:28 | “The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has the straw to do with the grain? says the Lord” | Berakhot 55a:16 | With regard to the verse: <b>“The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has the straw to do with the grain? says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:28), the Gemara asks: <b>What do straw and grain have to do with a dream? Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: Just as it is impossible for the grain</b> to grow <b>without straw, so too it is impossible to dream without idle matters.</b> Even a dream that will be fulfilled in the future contains some element of nonsense. |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | said to him: My son, open your mouth and let your words illuminate, as matters of Torah do not become ritually impure, as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord” | Berakhot 22a:8 | Further elaborating on the issue of Torah study while in a state of impurity, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira would say: Matters of Torah do not become ritually impure</b> and therefore one who is impure is permitted to engage in Torah study. He implemented this <i>halakha</i> in practice. The Gemara relates <b>an incident involving a student who was</b> reciting <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> <b>hesitantly before</b> the study hall of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b> The student experienced a seminal emission, and when he was asked to recite he did so in a rushed, uneven manner, as he did not want to utter the words of Torah explicitly. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: My son, open your mouth and let your words illuminate, as matters of Torah do not become ritually impure, as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as fire does not become ritually impure, so too matters of Torah do not become ritually impure.</b> |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | Torah scholars, whose entire bodies are fire, as it is written: “Surely My words are as fire, says the Lord” | Chagigah 27a:7 | § Apropos the coating of the altar, the Gemara cites an Aggadic teaching: <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The <b>fire of Gehenna has no power over Torah scholars.</b> This can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the salamander [<i>salamandra</i>],</b> a creature created out of fire and immune to its effects, and whose blood is fireproof: <b>If a salamander, which is</b> merely <b>a product of fire,</b> and nevertheless when <b>one anoints</b> his body <b>with its blood, fire has no power over him, all the more so</b> should fire not have any power over <b>Torah scholars, whose entire bodies are fire, as it is written: “Surely My words are as fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29), and the words of Torah become part of the Torah scholars’ very bodies. |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?” | Kiddushin 30b:8 | A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: My son, if this wretched one,</b> the evil inclination, <b>encounters you, pull it into the study hall,</b> i.e., go and study Torah. <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt, and if it is iron</b> it will <b>break, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Is not My word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). Just as a stone shatters a hammer, so too one can overcome his evil inclination, which is as strong as iron, through Torah study. With regard to the second part of the statement: <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt,</b> this is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), <b>and it states: “The water wears the stones”</b> (Job 14:19), indicating that water is stronger than stone. |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces” | Sanhedrin 34a:12 | § The Gemara discusses the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Abaye says: As the verse states: “God has spoken once, twice I have heard this; that strength belongs to God”</b> (Psalms 62:12). Abaye explains: <b>One verse</b> is stated by God and from it <b>emerge several explanations, but one explanation does not emerge from several verses.</b> Alternatively, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the verse states: “Is not My word like as fire? says the Lord; <b>and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as this hammer breaks</b> a stone <b>into several fragments, so too, one verse</b> is stated by God <b>and</b> from it <b>emerge several explanations.</b> |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | and like a hammer that shatters a rock?” | Shabbat 88b:3 | With regard to the revelation at Sinai, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The Lord gives the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host”</b> (Psalms 68:12)? It means that <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Almighty divided into seventy languages,</b> a great host. And, similarly, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> with regard to the verse: “Behold, is My word not like fire, declares the Lord, <b>and like a hammer that shatters a rock?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as this hammer breaks</b> a stone <b>into several fragments, so too, each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, divided into seventy languages.</b> The Gemara continues in praise of the Torah. <b>Rav Ḥananel bar Pappa said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Listen, for I will speak royal things,</b> and my lips will open with upright statements” (Proverbs 8:6)? <b>Why are matters of Torah likened to a king? To teach you</b> that <b>just as this king has</b> the power <b>to kill and to grant life, so too, matters of Torah have</b> the power <b>to kill and to grant life.</b> |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | iron, it will be shattered, as it is written: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord; and like a hammer that shatters rock” | Sukkah 52b:2 | <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If this scoundrel,</b> the evil inclination, <b>accosted you,</b> seeking to tempt you to sin, <b>drag it to the study hall</b> and study Torah. <b>If it is</b> like <b>a stone, it will be dissolved</b> by the Torah. <b>If it is</b> like <b>iron, it will be shattered.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If it is</b> like <b>stone, it will be dissolved, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who is thirsty, come you for the water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), water in this context meaning Torah; <b>and it is written: “Stones were worn by water”</b> (Job 14:19). <b>If it is</b> like <b>iron, it will be shattered, as it is written: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord; and like a hammer that shatters rock”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord” | Taanit 4a:2 | § <b>And,</b> incidentally, the Gemara relates that which <b>Rava said: This Torah scholar who grows angry,</b> it can be presumed that <b>it is his Torah study that angers him.</b> Therefore, he must be given the benefit of the doubt, <b>as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ashi said: Any Torah scholar who is not as hard as iron,</b> but is indecisive and wavers, he <b>is not a Torah scholar, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And as a hammer that breaks rock in pieces”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). |
| Jeremiah 23:29 | Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Why are matters of Torah compared to fire, as it is stated: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord” | Taanit 7a:9 | <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Why are matters of Torah compared to fire, as it is stated: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29)? <b>To tell you: Just as fire does not ignite</b> in <b>a lone</b> stick of wood but in a pile of kindling, <b>so too, matters of Torah are not retained</b> and understood properly by <b>a lone</b> scholar who studies by himself, but by a group of Sages. |
| Jeremiah 25:30 | over His dwelling place, | Berakhot 3a:6 | The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds that the night consists of three watches,</b> and he employs this particular language of watches <b>in order to teach us: There are watches in heaven and there are watches on earth;</b> just as our night is divided into watches, so too is the night in the upper worlds. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and roars like a lion</b> in pain over the destruction of the Temple. This imagery is derived from a reference in the Bible, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord roars [<i>yishag</i>] from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily</b> [<b><i>shaog yishag</i></b>] <b>over His dwelling place,</b> He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” (Jeremiah 25:30). The three instances of the root <i>shin-alef-gimmel</i> in this verse correspond to the three watches of the night. |
| Jeremiah 25:30 | He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” | Berakhot 59a:6 | <b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). |
| Jeremiah 26:1 | which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from the Lord, saying” | Arakhin 17a:5 | The Gemara cites proof for these claims. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from the Lord, saying”</b> (Jeremiah 26:1), and similarly with regard to Zedekiah the verse states: “And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying” (Jeremiah 28:1). Why did the prophet use the term “in the beginning” exclusively with regard to these two kings, as opposed to: During the first year of his reign, or a similar formulation? |
| Jeremiah 26:1 | which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah” | Sanhedrin 103a:4 | § <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah”</b> (Jeremiah 26:1), <b>and it is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah”</b> (Jeremiah 28:1). <b>But is it so</b> that <b>until now there were no kings?</b> Why did the prophet use the term “in the beginning” exclusively with regard to these two kings, as opposed to: During the first year of his reign, or a similar formulation? |
| Jeremiah 27:6 | “And the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him” | Shabbat 150a:2 | The Gemara cites another verse pertaining to Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“And surpassing greatness was added unto me”</b> (Daniel 4:33), about which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: This teaches that</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>rode atop a male lion and tied a serpent to its head, fulfilling what was said</b> of him: <b>“And the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him”</b> (Jeremiah 27:6). |
| Jeremiah 27:8 | will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylonia, | Megillah 11a:24 | <b>Nebuchadnezzar</b> also ruled over the whole world, <b>as it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom</b> that not serve this same Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylonia, and that <b>will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylonia,</b> that nation will I visit, says the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand” (Jeremiah 27:8). <b>Ahasuerus</b> also ruled the world, <b>as we have said</b> above. |
| Jeremiah 27:21 | service vessels, | Ketubot 111a:1 | <b>“They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 27:22). Based on that verse, Rav Yehuda held that since the Babylonian exile was imposed by divine decree, permission to leave Babylonia for Eretz Yisrael could be granted only by God. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> interpret that verse? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Zeira maintains that <b>that</b> verse <b>is written about</b> the Temple <b>service vessels,</b> and it does not refer to the Jewish people, as the previous verse states: “Thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord” (Jeremiah 27:21). Consequently, Rabbi Zeira sought to ascend to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Jeremiah 27:22 | as Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord” | Berakhot 24b:8 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Abba was avoiding</b> being seen <b>by</b> his teacher <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as Rabbi Abba <b>sought to ascend to Eretz Yisrael</b> and his teacher disapproved, <b>as Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 27:22). Rabbi Abba did not want to discuss his desire to emigrate with Rav Yehuda. Nevertheless <b>he said: I will go and hear something from him at the hall</b> where the Sages <b>assemble,</b> without being seen, <b>and afterwards I will leave</b> Babylonia. |
| Jeremiah 27:22 | “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord” | Ketubot 111a:1 | <b>“They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 27:22).

| Jeremiah 27:22 | As Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain | Shabbat 41a:5 | Speaking of bathing and its <i>halakhot</i>, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira was avoiding</b> being seen <b>by</b> his teacher, <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as Rabbi Zeira <b>sought to ascend to Eretz Yisrael</b> and his teacher disapproved. <b>As Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain</b> until the day that I recall them, said the Lord” (Jeremiah 27:22). Based on that verse, Rav Yehuda held that since the Babylonian exile was by divine decree, permission to leave Babylonia for Eretz Yisrael could only be granted by God. Rabbi Zeira did not want to discuss his desire to emigrate with Rav Yehuda, so that he would not be forced to explicitly disobey him. Nevertheless, <b>he said: I will go and hear something from him and then I will leave.

| Jeremiah 28:1 | and it is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah” | Sanhedrin 103a:4 | § <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah”</b> (Jeremiah 26:1), <b>and it is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah”</b> (Jeremiah 28:1). <b>But is it so</b> that <b>until now there were no kings?</b> Why did the prophet use the term “in the beginning” exclusively with regard to these two kings, as opposed to: During the first year of his reign, or a similar formulation? |
| Jeremiah 28:2 | I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon” | Sanhedrin 89a:20 | § The mishna lists among those liable to be executed as false prophets <b>one who prophesies that which was not stated to him.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>For example, Hananiah, son of Azzur, as Jeremiah was standing in the upper market</b> in Jerusalem <b>and saying: “So says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,</b> the chief of their might” (Jeremiah 49:35). <b>Hananiah raised an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>himself: If,</b> with regard to <b>Elam, which came only to assist Babylonia, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,” all the more so</b> are <b>the Chaldeans,</b> i.e., the Babylonians, <b>themselves,</b> destined to fall. Hananiah <b>came to the lower market</b> and <b>said: “So speaks the Lord</b> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: <b>I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon”</b> (Jeremiah 28:2). As a result, Hananiah, son of Azzur, was killed at the hand of Heaven (Jeremiah 28:16). |
| Jeremiah 28:6 | confirmation of the statement within it, as it is written: “And Jeremiah the prophet said: Amen, may the Lord do so; may the Lord uphold your statement” | Shevuot 36a:12 | There is an element of <b>confirmation of the statement within it, as it is written: “And Jeremiah the prophet said: Amen, may the Lord do so; may the Lord uphold your statement”</b> (Jeremiah 28:6). |
| Jeremiah 29:5 | “Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them” | Bava Batra29a:1 | <b>Because if you do not say so,</b> then when he states: <b>“Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them”</b> (Jeremiah 29:5), <b>what</b> halakhic statement <b>was he saying? Rather, he teaches us good advice,</b> and <b>here too he teaches us good advice.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Know</b> that this was mere advice, <b>as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). This is obviously good advice to preserve the items properly, and is not a halakhic statement. Therefore, this is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in under three years. |
| Jeremiah 29:6 | as it is written: “Take wives for yourselves and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands” | Ketubot 52b:11 | The Gemara answers: <b>This also</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “Take wives for yourselves and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands”</b> (Jeremiah 29:6). This verse requires clarification. <b>Granted, sons are in his hands,</b> i.e., a father can select wives for them, <b>but daughters, are they in his power</b> that he can select husbands for them? It is not the manner of a woman or her family to court a man. |
| Jeremiah 29:6 | As it is written: “Take wives and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men” | Kiddushin 30b:9 | § The <i>baraita</i> (29a) teaches that a father is commanded <b>to marry</b> his son to <b>a woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this matter? <b>As it is written: “Take wives and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men”</b> (Jeremiah 29:6). |
| Jeremiah 29:10 | “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylonia I will remember you | Megillah 11b:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> this calculation? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Jeremiah’s prophecy of a return to Eretz Yisrael: <b>“After seventy years are accomplished for Babylonia I will remember you</b> and perform My good word toward you, enabling you to return to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written</b> in a slightly different formulation: “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, meditated in the books, over the number of the years, which the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, <b>that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years”</b> (Daniel 9:2). <b>He,</b> Belshazzar, <b>calculated</b> as follows: <b>Forty-five</b> years <b>of Nebuchadnezzar, and twenty-three of Evil-merodach, and two of his</b> own, for a total of <b>seventy</b> years that had passed without redemption. He was therefore certain that Jeremiah’s prophecy would no longer be fulfilled, and he therefore said: <b>I will take out the vessels of the Holy Temple and use them.</b> |
| Jeremiah 29:10 | are accomplished for Babylonia | Megillah 12a:3 | The Gemara comments: <b>In any case, the verses contradict each other</b> with regard to how the seventy years should be calculated. In one verse <b>it is written:</b> “After seventy years <b>are accomplished for Babylonia</b> I will remember [<i>efkod</i>] you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10), which indicates that the seventy years should be counted from the Babylonian exile. <b>And</b> in another verse <b>it is written:</b> “That he would accomplish <b>for the desolations of Jerusalem</b> seventy years” (Daniel 9:2), indicating that the seventy years are calculated from the destruction of Jerusalem. |
| Jeremiah 29:11 | “To give to you a future and a hope” | Taanit 29b:2 | The Gemara mentions a couple of other statements in the name of the same Sages mentioned above. First, it cites a verse that is referring to the Babylonian exile. <b>“To give to you a future and a hope”</b> (Jeremiah 29:11). <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: These are palm trees and garments of linen,</b> which are long-lasting and bring benefit as long as they exist. With regard to Isaac’s comment about Jacob: <b>“And he said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed”</b> (Genesis 27:27), <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav:</b> This <b>smell</b> was like that <b>of a field of apple trees.</b> |
| Jeremiah 29:21 | “So says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you a lie in My name: | Sanhedrin 93a:12 | § Apropos the deliverance of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, the Gemara cites the verses: <b>“So says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you a lie in My name:</b> Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylonia; and he shall slay them before your eyes” (Jeremiah 29:21). <b>And it is written: “And of them shall be taken a curse by all the captivity of Judea, who are in Babylonia, saying: May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylonia toasted in the fire”</b> (Jeremiah 29:22). It <b>is not stated: Whom</b> the king of Babylonia <b>burned, but “whom</b> the king of Babylonia <b>toasted.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: This teaches that he rendered them like toasted wheat,</b> which is toasted on all sides. |
| Jeremiah 29:22 | And it is written: “And of them shall be taken a curse by all the captivity of Judea, who are in Babylonia, saying: May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylonia toasted in the fire” | Sanhedrin 93a:12 | § Apropos the deliverance of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, the Gemara cites the verses: <b>“So says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you a lie in My name:</b> Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylonia; and he shall slay them before your eyes” (Jeremiah 29:21). <b>And it is written: “And of them shall be taken a curse by all the captivity of Judea, who are in Babylonia, saying: May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylonia toasted in the fire”</b> (Jeremiah 29:22). It <b>is not stated: Whom</b> the king of Babylonia <b>burned, but “whom</b> the king of Babylonia <b>toasted.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: This teaches that he rendered them like toasted wheat,</b> which is toasted on all sides. |
| Jeremiah 29:23 | “Because they have committed baseness in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors” | Sanhedrin 93a:13 | The verse states: <b>“Because they have committed baseness in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors”</b> (Jeremiah 29:23). <b>What did they do?</b> The Gemara relates: <b>They went to the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. Ahab said to her: So says the Lord: Submit to Zedekiah</b> and engage in intercourse with him. <b>And Zedekiah said</b> to her: <b>So says the Lord: Submit to Ahab</b> and engage in intercourse with him. <b>She went and said to her father</b> what they said to her. Nebuchadnezzar <b>said to her: The God of these</b> people <b>abhors lewdness,</b> so this is likely a false prophecy. <b>When they come to you, send them to me.</b> |
| Jeremiah 30:6 | “Ask now, and see whether a man gives birth. Why, then, do I see every man [ kol gever ] with his hands on his loins, as a woman in labor, and all faces turned green?” | Sanhedrin 98b:9 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: <b>Rather,</b> the reason I am concerned is <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the day of God: <b>“Ask now, and see whether a man gives birth. Why, then, do I see every man [<i>kol gever</i>] with his hands on his loins, as a woman in labor, and all faces turned green?”</b> (Jeremiah 30:6). |
| Jeremiah 30:9 | as it is stated: “And they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will establish for them” | Sanhedrin 98b:16 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to establish another David</b> for the Jewish people as the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will establish for them”</b> (Jeremiah 30:9). <b>It is not stated: I established, but “I will establish,”</b> indicating that the name of the future king will be David. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But isn’t it written: “And my servant David shall be their prince forever”</b> (Ezekiel 37:25), indicating that King David himself will rule over the Jewish people? Abaye said: They will rule in tandem <b>like an emperor and a viceroy;</b> the Messiah will be king and David will be second-in-command. |
| Jeremiah 30:10 | I am interpreting a verse, as it is stated: “Therefore do not fear, Jacob My servant, says the Lord, neither be dismayed, Israel, for I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity” | Taanit 5b:9 | <b>After they had eaten,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Our patriarch Jacob did not die.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>asked him</b> in surprise: <b>And was it for naught that the eulogizers eulogized</b> him <b>and the embalmers embalmed</b> him <b>and the buriers buried</b> him? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>replied to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>I am interpreting a verse, as it is stated: “Therefore do not fear, Jacob My servant, says the Lord, neither be dismayed, Israel, for I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity”</b> (Jeremiah 30:10). This verse <b>juxtaposes Jacob to his seed: Just as his seed is alive</b> when redeemed, <b>so too,</b> Jacob himself <b>is alive.</b> |
| Jeremiah 30:17 | commemoration of the Temple? As the verse states: “For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the Lord; because they have called you an outcast: She is Zion, there is none who care for her” | Rosh Hashanah30a:18 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one performs</b> actions in <b>commemoration of the Temple? As the verse states: “For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the Lord; because they have called you an outcast: She is Zion, there is none who care for her”</b> (Jeremiah 30:17). This verse teaches <b>by inference that</b> Jerusalem <b>requires caring</b> through acts of commemoration. |
| Jeremiah 30:17 | as the verse states: “For I will restore health unto you and I will heal you of your wounds, says the Lord; because they have called you an outcast, she is Zion, there is none that seeks her” | Sukkah 41a:8 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>we institute</b> ordinances in <b>commemoration of the Temple? Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that it is <b>as the verse states: “For I will restore health unto you and I will heal you of your wounds, says the Lord; because they have called you an outcast, she is Zion, there is none that seeks her”</b> (Jeremiah 30:17). From the fact that the verse states: “There is none that seeks her,” it can be learned <b>by inference that it requires seeking,</b> i.e., people should think of and remember the Temple. That is the reason for Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s ordinance. |
| Jeremiah 30:20 | Is that so? But isn’t it written: “I will punish all that oppress them” | Bava Batra8b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>What authority</b> is associated with collecting charity? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: Because they can seize collateral for the charity;</b> i.e., they can collect charity by force, <b>and even on Shabbat eve,</b> when people are busy and might claim that they have no time or money. The Gemara objects: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it written: “I will punish all that oppress them”</b> (Jeremiah 30:20), <b>and Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav: And</b> punishment will be meted out <b>even to charity collectors?</b> If charity collectors are permitted to force people to contribute charity, why are they counted among Israel’s oppressors? |
| Jeremiah 30:21 | only a king, as it is written: “And their mighty one shall be of themselves, | Gittin 56b:1 | <b>in truth, you are a king,</b> if not now, then in the future. <b>As if you are not a king, Jerusalem will not be handed over into your hand, as it is written: “And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one”</b> (Isaiah 10:34). <b>And “mighty one”</b> means <b>only a king, as it is written: “And their mighty one shall be of themselves,</b> and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them” (Jeremiah 30:21), indicating that “mighty one” parallels “ruler.” <b>And “Lebanon”</b> means <b>only the Temple, as it is stated: “That good mountain and the Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25). <b>And</b> as for <b>what you said</b> with your second comment: <b>If I am a king why didn’t you come to me until now, there are zealots among us</b> who <b>did not allow us</b> to do this. |
| Jeremiah 30:21 | as it is stated: “And their prince shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from their midst” | Sanhedrin 98b:15 | <b>Rav Naḥman says: If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the living</b> in this generation, he is a person <b>such as me,</b> who already has dominion over the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “And their prince shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from their midst”</b> (Jeremiah 30:21), indicating that the redeemer is already in power. <b>Rav says: If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the living</b> in this generation, he is a person <b>such as our saintly Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who was renowned for his sanctity, piety, and Torah knowledge. <b>If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the dead</b> he is a person <b>such as Daniel, the beloved man.</b> |
| Jeremiah 30:25 | among Israel, as it is stated: “At that time, says the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel” | Kiddushin 70b:13 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence, He rests it only upon families of</b> unflawed lineage <b>among Israel, as it is stated: “At that time, says the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel”</b> (Jeremiah 30:25). <b>Of all Israel, is not stated, but “of all the families,”</b> which includes only those of unflawed lineage, the renowned families of Israel. |
| Jeremiah 31:1 | and said: “Even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest” | Makkot 24a:29 | <b>Moses said: “And among these nations you shall have no repose”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65). <b>Jeremiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “Even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest”</b> (Jeremiah 31:1), indicating that the Jewish people will find rest even in exile. |
| Jeremiah 31:2 | “Afar off”; as it is written: “From afar the Lord appeared to me” | Sotah 11a:5 | With regard to Miriam’s deed the verse states: <b>“And his sister stood afar off,</b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: This entire verse is stated in reference to the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., each phrase alludes to the Divine Presence watching over Moses. <b>“And</b> his sister <b>stood”; as it is written: “And the Lord came, and stood”</b> (I Samuel 3:10). <b>“His sister”; as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>“Afar off”; as it is written: “From afar the Lord appeared to me”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2). <b>“To know”; as it is written: “For the Lord is a God of knowledge”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>“What”; as it is written: “What does the Lord God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). <b>“Would be done”; as it is written: “For the Lord God will do nothing”</b> (Amos 3:7). <b>“To him”; as it is written: “And the Lord said to him: Peace</b> be with you” (Judges 6:23). |
| Jeremiah 31:3 | An eternal love, and so it says: “And an eternal love I have loved you, therefore I have drawn you with kindness” | Berakhot 11b:9 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not recite: An eternal love [<i>ahavat olam</i>]; rather,</b> one recites: <b>An abounding love. And the Rabbis say</b> that one recites: <b>An eternal love, and so it says: “And an eternal love I have loved you, therefore I have drawn you with kindness”</b> (Jeremiah 31:3). |
| Jeremiah 31:7 | and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and the woman giving birth together” | Sanhedrin 91b:8 | § <b>Reish Lakish raises a contradiction</b> between two verses written with regard to the resurrection of the dead. <b>It is written:</b> “I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the ends of the earth, <b>and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and the woman giving birth together”</b> (Jeremiah 31:7), indicating that at the end of days there will still be people with physical defects. <b>And it is written: “Then shall the lame man leap as a deer and the tongue of the mute sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert”</b> (Isaiah 35:6), indicating that at the end of days there will be no people with physical defects. <b>How so?</b> When resurrected, the dead <b>will arise</b> still afflicted <b>with their defects, and</b> they <b>will</b> then <b>be healed.</b> |
| Jeremiah 31:7 | a woman will give birth every day, as it says: “The woman with child and her that gives birth together” | Shabbat 30b:9 | <b>In matters of Torah, what is</b> the case with regard to which the verse said that one should respond to a fool’s folly? <b>As in</b> the case <b>where Rabban Gamliel was sitting and he interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: In the future,</b> in the World-to-Come, <b>a woman will give birth every day, as it says: “The woman with child and her that gives birth together”</b> (Jeremiah 31:7), explaining that birth will occur on the same day as conception. <b>A certain student scoffed at him</b> and <b>said:</b> That cannot be, as it has already been stated: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: Come and I will show you an example</b> of this <b>in this world. He took him outside and showed him a chicken</b> that lays eggs every day. |
| Jeremiah 31:12 | for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>Three transformations:</b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing;</b><br><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12);<br><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together;</b><br><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12);<br>and: <b>“Nevertheless the Lord your God would not hearken unto Balaam;</b><br><b>but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Jeremiah 31:12 | Rav Kahana raises a contradiction: | Sanhedrin 70a:14 | <b>Rav Kahana raises a contradiction:</b> The verse states: “Therefore, they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the bounty of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd” (Jeremiah 31:12). The word for wine <b>is written <i>tirash</i>,</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>, <b>but we read</b> it as <b><i>tirosh</i>,</b> with the letter <i>vav</i>. The matter can be explained as follows: If <b>one merits</b> and drinks a moderate amount <b>he becomes a leader [<i>rosh</i>],</b> whereas if <b>he does not merit</b> and drinks excessively <b>he becomes poor [<i>rash</i>].</b> |
| Jeremiah 31:20 | “Set up signposts [ tziyyunim ] for yourself; establish you | Eruvin 54b:24 | <b>Rav Taḥalifa of the West,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard this</b> statement and <b>went</b> and <b>said it before Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>said: You learn this</b> idea <b>from there; we learn it from here,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Set up signposts [<i>tziyyunim</i>] for yourself; establish you</b> markers” (Jeremiah 31:20), which is understood to mean: <b>Establish</b> mnemonic <b>signs for the Torah. And from where</b> may it be inferred <b>that this</b> term <b><i>tziyyun</i> denotes a sign? As it is written</b> in a different verse: “And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, <b>and any sees a human bone, he shall set up a sign</b> [<b><i>tziyyun</i></b>] <b>by it”</b> (Ezekiel 39:15), i.e., a sign that there is a source of ritual impurity at that spot. |
| Jeremiah 31:22 | without a wall, as it is written: “A woman shall go round a man” | Yevamot 62b:14 | <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>say:</b> One who lives without a wife is left <b>without Torah,</b> and <b>without a wall</b> of protection. He is <b>without Torah, as it is written: “Is it that I have no help in me, and that sound wisdom is driven from me?”</b> (Job 6:13), indicating that one who does not have a wife lacks sound wisdom, i.e., Torah. He is <b>without a wall, as it is written: “A woman shall go round a man”</b> (Jeremiah 31:22), similar to a protective wall. |
| Jeremiah 31:26 | a virtue? But isn’t it written: “And I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal” | Chullin 5b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And everywhere that</b> the terms <b>“man” and “animal” are written</b> together, does it indicate <b>a virtue? But isn’t it written: “And I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal”</b> (Jeremiah 31:26), and the Sages interpreted the phrase “seed of animal” as a reference to ignorant, inferior people. The Gemara answers: <b>There, doesn’t the verse separate</b> man and animal? <b>The seed of man</b> is <b>discrete and the seed of animal</b> is <b>discrete.</b> |
| Jeremiah 31:26 | and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast” | Sotah 22a:5 | If one <b>read</b> the Written Torah <b>but did not learn</b> the Mishna, <b>he is a boor. With regard to</b> one who <b>did not read and did not learn</b> at all, <b>the verse states:</b> “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, <b>and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast”</b> (Jeremiah 31:26). One who has not studied at all is comparable to a beast. |
| Jeremiah 31:37 | shall be built | Nedarim 37b:9 | Words that are <b>read but not written</b> are included in the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. For example, the word <b>“Euphrates” that</b> is in the phrase <b>“as he went</b> to establish his control over the river Euphrates” (II Samuel 8:3) is not written in the text of the Bible. The same is true for the word <b>“man” that</b> is in the verse “now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, <b>was as if a man inquired of the word of God”</b> (II Samuel 16:23); and for the word <b>“come” that</b> is in the verse “behold, the days come, says the Lord, that the city <b>shall be built</b> to the Lord from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner” (Jeremiah 31:37); and for <b>“her” that</b> is in the phrase “let her not have <b>escape”</b> (Jeremiah 50:29); <b>unto that</b> is in the verse “it has <b>been told me,</b> all that you have done unto your mother-in-law” (Ruth 2:11); and for <b>“to me” that</b> is found in the passage “and she said unto her: All that you say to me I will do. And she went down to <b>the threshing floor”</b> (Ruth 3:4–5); and for <b>“to me” that</b> is in the verse “he gave me these six measures of <b>barley;</b> for he said to me” (Ruth 3:17). <b>These</b> words <b>are read but not written.</b> |
| Jeremiah 32:11 | from here: “So I took the deed of the purchase, that which was sealed, the terms and conditions, and that which was open” | Bava Batra160b:3 | <b>Rafram says</b> that there is a different source for two kinds of documents, <b>from here: “So I took the deed of the purchase, that which was sealed, the terms and conditions, and that which was open”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11). When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase,” this</b> is referring to <b>an ordinary</b> document. When it states: <b>“That which was sealed,” this</b> is referring to <b>a tied</b> document. When it states: <b>“And that which was open,” this</b> is referring to the <b>ordinary,</b> unfolded part <b>of a tied</b> document. |
| Jeremiah 32:11 | “So I took the deed of the purchase” | Bava Batra160b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>these</b> verses <b>are coming for this</b> purpose, to teach that there are two types of documents? But <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>comes for its</b> own <b>purpose.</b> The first verse comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them,</b> and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44), it is merely to <b>teach us good advice,</b> that people should carefully document their purchases in order to provide permanent proof of purchase. When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), <b>this was</b> merely how that <b>incident</b> occurred, and the phrase is not intended to teach any <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses</b> shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), this is stated in order <b>to juxtapose three</b> witnesses <b>with two</b> witnesses for several reasons, as delineated <b>in the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 5b). |
| Jeremiah 32:11 | deed of purchase” | Gittin 20b:17 | <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on what is stated in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 2:3): <b>Even he,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, who was quoted earlier in this mishna, <b>testified about a small village that was adjacent to Jerusalem, and there was an old man there who would lend</b> money <b>to all the residents of the village. And he would write</b> the documents <b>in his handwriting and others</b> would <b>sign. And the incident came before the Sages and they deemed it valid. And why</b> did they deem it valid? <b>Isn’t there a need</b> to fulfill this verse: “I took the <b>deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), requiring that the document itself be transferred from the seller to the buyer, <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> the case here, as the document attesting to the loan was in the possession of the creditor the entire time? |
| Jeremiah 32:11 | from here: “And I took the deed of purchase” | Kiddushin 26a:7 | § The mishna teaches that land can be purchased <b>by</b> means of <b>a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “And write in a document and sign, and witnesses shall testify”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), <b>but didn’t you say</b> that the document mentioned in the verse <b>is merely a document of proof? Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), an expression that indicates that the document itself effects the acquisition. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the document itself effects acquisition <b>only</b> in the case <b>of a deed of a gift. But with regard to a sale, it does not effect acquisition until</b> the buyer <b>gives</b> the seller <b>money.</b> The document itself does not effect the acquisition. |
| Jeremiah 32:11 | “And I took the deed of purchase” | Kiddushin 9a:10 | <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> There is no proof from the verses for these rulings, as <b>they are a <i>halakha</i></b> received through tradition, <b>and the Sages based them on</b> the <b>verses. And if you wish, say: There too,</b> in the case in Jeremiah, <b>it is written</b> with regard to the buyer: <b>“And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), thereby indicating that it is the seller who writes the document. |
| Jeremiah 32:14 | as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days” | Bava Batra29a:1 | <b>Because if you do not say so,</b> then when he states: <b>“Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them”</b> (Jeremiah 29:5), <b>what</b> halakhic statement <b>was he saying? Rather, he teaches us good advice,</b> and <b>here too he teaches us good advice.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Know</b> that this was mere advice, <b>as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). This is obviously good advice to preserve the items properly, and is not a halakhic statement. Therefore, this is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in under three years. |
| Jeremiah 32:14 | “And put them in an earthen vessel; so that they will remain many days” | Gittin 22b:4 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> the <i>amora</i> also <b>says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar deemed valid</b> a document that is written on these surfaces <b>only with regard to bills of divorce but not for other documents, as it is written</b> with regard to a deed of purchase: <b>“And put them in an earthen vessel; so that they will remain many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). This indicates that a deed of purchase and other similar documents must be made from a material that will last for a long time without being changed. A document that can be forged may not be relied upon long term. |
| Jeremiah 32:14 | in an earthenware vessel, as it is stated: “And put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for many days” | Megillah 26b:16 | <b>And Rava said: A Torah scroll that became worn out is interred</b> and buried <b>next to a Torah scholar, and</b> in this regard, a Torah scholar is defined <b>even</b> as <b>one who</b> only <b>studies the <i>halakhot</i></b> in the Mishna and the <i>baraitot</i> but is not proficient in their analysis. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And</b> when it is buried, it is first placed <b>in an earthenware vessel, as it is stated: “And put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). |
| Jeremiah 32:18 | iniquity. Here, it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated,” and there it is written: “He repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children” | Berakhot 5b:3 | An answer was provided to Rabbi Yoḥanan when <b>a certain elder taught him in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai:</b> This conclusion <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the words <b>iniquity</b> and <b>iniquity. Here, it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated,” and there it is written: “He repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children”</b> (Jeremiah 32:18). Because he “repays the iniquity of the fathers onto the bosom of their children,” the father’s transgressions are forgiven. |
| Jeremiah 32:18 | he did not say awesome | Yoma 69b:14 | The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> interpretation that <b>Rav Mattana</b> said <b>leans to,</b> i.e., is consonant with, the exposition <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Why are</b> the Sages of those generations <b>called the members of the Great Assembly?</b> It is <b>because they returned the crown</b> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>to its former</b> glory. How so? <b>Moses came</b> and <b>said</b> in his prayer: <b>“The great, the mighty, and the awesomeGod”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17). <b>Jeremiah</b> the prophet <b>came and said: Gentiles,</b> i.e., the minions of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>are carousing in His sanctuary; where is His awesomeness?</b> Therefore, <b>he did not say awesome</b> in his prayer: “The great God, the mighty Lord of Hosts, is His name” (Jeremiah 32:18). <b>Daniel came</b> and <b>said: Gentiles are enslaving His children; where is His might?</b> Therefore <b>he did not say mighty</b> in his prayer: “The great and awesome God” (Daniel 9:4). |
| Jeremiah 32:19 | “A God of faithfulness and without iniquity.” His daughter said: “Great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways | Avodah Zarah18a:5 | The Gemara relates: <b>When the three of them went out</b> after being sentenced, <b>they accepted the</b> justice of God’s <b>judgment.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>said: “The Rock, His work is perfect;</b> for all His ways are justice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). <b>And his wife said</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“A God of faithfulness and without iniquity.” His daughter said: “Great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways</b> of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways” (Jeremiah 32:19). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: How great are these righteous people, that</b> these <b>three verses,</b> which speak <b>of</b> the <b>acceptance of</b> God’s <b>judgment, occurred to them at the time of accepting the</b> righteousness of His <b>judgment.</b> |
| Jeremiah 32:31 | and one verse states: “For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it until this day, | Niddah 70b:6 | The sages of Alexandria further asked: <b>One verse states: “For the Lord has chosen Zion;</b> He has desired it for His dwelling place” (Psalms 132:13), <b>and one verse states: “For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it until this day,</b> so that I should remove it from before My face” (Jeremiah 32:31). Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Psalms is referring to the time <b>before Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter</b> (see I Kings 3:1), whereas <b>there,</b> the verse in Jeremiah is speaking of the time <b>after Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter.</b> |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | Rabbi Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses” | Bava Batra160a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What biblical basis is there for the existence of these two types of documents? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,”</b> |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | “They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, | Bava Batra160b:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>these</b> verses <b>are coming for this</b> purpose, to teach that there are two types of documents? But <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>comes for its</b> own <b>purpose.</b> The first verse comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them,</b> and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44), it is merely to <b>teach us good advice,</b> that people should carefully document their purchases in order to provide permanent proof of purchase. When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), <b>this was</b> merely how that <b>incident</b> occurred, and the phrase is not intended to teach any <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses</b> shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), this is stated in order <b>to juxtapose three</b> witnesses <b>with two</b> witnesses for several reasons, as delineated <b>in the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 5b). |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | “Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them” | Bava Batra28b:13 | <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>it is written</b> in the <b>verse</b> detailing the purchase of a field from Hanamel by Jeremiah, his cousin, during the time of the siege of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). This describes the writing of a bill of sale to serve as proof of ownership of the field, since he was unable to remain living there for three years to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>As the prophet</b> Jeremiah <b>stood in the tenth</b> year of King Zedekiah’s reign <b>and warned</b> people to write bills of sale <b>for the eleventh</b> year, when Eretz Yisrael would be overrun. Consequently, despite the fact that one purchasing a field there would be able to live on the land for two years, this would not be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, which is why he said that they should have bills of sale written. |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | as it is written: “And subscribe the deeds, and sign | Gittin 36a:4 | § The mishna taught: <b>And the witnesses sign the bill of divorce for the betterment of the world.</b> The Gemara asks: Is the reason that the witnesses sign the bill of divorce <b>for the betterment of the world? It is by Torah law</b> that they must sign, <b>as it is written: “And subscribe the deeds, and sign</b> them, and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44). |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | the verse states: “They shall acquire fields with money” | Kiddushin 26a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>From where do we</b> derive that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of <b>money? Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the proof is from that verse, one can <b>say</b> that the acquisition is not valid <b>unless there is a document</b> as well, <b>as it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And write a document and sign”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara answers: <b>If it were written: They shall acquire</b> fields with money, <b>at the end</b> of the verse, it would be <b>as you said,</b> that one must also write a document so that he can acquire the land with money. <b>Now that it is written “they shall acquire” at the beginning</b> of the verse, this teaches that the <b>money</b> itself <b>effects acquisition</b> of the land, and the <b>document is merely a proof.</b> |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | because it is written: “And write in a document and sign, and witnesses shall testify” | Kiddushin 26a:7 | § The mishna teaches that land can be purchased <b>by</b> means of <b>a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “And write in a document and sign, and witnesses shall testify”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), <b>but didn’t you say</b> that the document mentioned in the verse <b>is merely a document of proof? Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), an expression that indicates that the document itself effects the acquisition. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the document itself effects acquisition <b>only</b> in the case <b>of a deed of a gift. But with regard to a sale, it does not effect acquisition until</b> the buyer <b>gives</b> the seller <b>money.</b> The document itself does not effect the acquisition. |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | “They shall acquire fields with money” | Kiddushin 2b:1 | <b>Alternatively,</b> it can be proven that purchasing a field with money is called an acquisition from the verse: <b>“They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). Consequently, as the <i>tanna</i> wanted to teach that a woman can be betrothed with money, <b>he taught: A woman is acquired.</b> This explains why the terminology of acquisition is used in this mishna. |
| Jeremiah 32:44 | it is also written: “Men shall buy [ yiknu ] fields for money” | Kiddushin 9a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the case of a sale, <b>it is also written: “Men shall buy [<i>yiknu</i>] fields for money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), which indicates that the matter depends upon the buyer. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse: Shall sell <b>[<i>yikkanu</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you read it</b> as <b><i>yikkanu</i>; because it is written</b> in the verse in Leviticus: <b>“And sells,”</b> and there is a preference to have the verse from the Prophets accord with that of the Torah? <b>So too,</b> instead of: “If a man takes [<i>ki yikaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:13), <b>read into</b> the verse: When he is given <b>[<i>ki yakiaḥ</i>], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), so that the verses will accord with each other. |
| Jeremiah 33:11 | as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts, | Berakhot 6b:29 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone who benefits from the feast of a groom but does not cause him to rejoice violates the five voices</b> mentioned in this verse, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say: Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,</b> for the Lord is good, for His mercy lasts forever, even of those who bring a thanks-offering to the house of the Lord. For I will restore the captivity of the land as it was in the beginning, says the Lord” (Jeremiah 33:11). These five voices in the context of a bride and groom correspond to the five voices mentioned in the context of the revelation at Sinai, as in Song of Songs, the day of the revelation at Sinai is alluded to by the phrase: His wedding day (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto, Maharsha). |
| Jeremiah 33:13 | “Who counts them” | Bekhorot 54b:15 | <b>And Shmuel says: Even</b> if there are <b>five from here and five from there and</b> only <b>one in the middle</b> they may be tithed together. The reason is that <b>we see the shepherd as one who stands here</b> in the middle <b>and we apply</b> the verse: <b>“Who counts them”</b> (Jeremiah 33:13), to him. Since he can see and count both sides from his vantage point in the middle, they are all considered one flock. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | a conflict of interest, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” | Avodah Zarah3a:6 | The nations <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> in this matter the <b>testimony of heaven and earth is</b> tainted by <b>a conflict of interest, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). <b>And</b> concerning this verse, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the acts of Creation, and said: If the Jewish people accept My Torah</b> at the revelation at Sinai, all is <b>well, but if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder.</b> |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | watches, heaven and earth would not endure, as it is stated: “Were it not for My covenant day and night, I would not have set the statutes of heaven and earth” | Megillah 31b:3 | § The mishna states: <b>In the</b> non-priestly <b>watches</b> they read <b>the act of Creation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., why do they read the account of Creation? <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> To allude to the fact that <b>were it not for</b> the non-priestly <b>watches, heaven and earth would not endure, as it is stated: “Were it not for My covenant day and night, I would not have set the statutes of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). God’s covenant is referring to the offerings sacrificed in the Temple, which sustain the world. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | circumcision that if not for it the Holy One, Blessed be He, would not have created His world, as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” | Nedarim 31b:12 | <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that if not for it the Holy One, Blessed be He, would not have created His world, as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | circumcision that if not for circumcision heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, | Nedarim 32a:6 | <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that it is equal to all the mitzvot of the Torah, as it is stated</b> at the giving of the Torah: <b>“For according to these words</b> I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” (Exodus 34:27), and “covenant” refers to circumcision. <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that if not for circumcision heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night,</b> I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | of Rabbi Eliezer, for Rabbi Eliezer said: Great is the Torah, for if not for Torah, heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, | Nedarim 32a:7 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the words <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, for Rabbi Eliezer said: Great is the Torah, for if not for Torah, heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night,</b> I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). According to Rabbi Eliezer, the covenant that exists day and night is the Torah, as it says: “You should contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8). |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant by day and by night, I would not have set up the laws of heaven and earth” | Pesachim 68b:13 | A somewhat similar story is told about <b>Rav Sheshet,</b> that <b>every thirty days he would review his studies</b> that he had learned over the previous month, <b>and he would stand and lean against the bolt of the door and say: Rejoice my soul, rejoice my soul, for you I have read</b> Scripture, <b>for you I have studied</b> Mishna. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that Torah study is beneficial only for the soul of the person who has studied? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: If not for the Torah</b> and its study, <b>heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant by day and by night, I would not have set up the laws of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). It is the Torah, the eternal covenant that is studied day and night, that justifies the continued existence of the world. The Gemara answers: This is indeed correct, but <b>at the outset when a person does</b> this mitzva, <b>he does it for himself,</b> and only afterward does he have in mind the benefit that will be brought to the entire world. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | as it is written: “If not for My covenant, I would not have appointed day and night, the laws of heaven and earth” | Sanhedrin 99b:18 | <b>Abaye said to him: That</b> person who questions the benefit provided by Sages is <b>also</b> in the category of one <b>who interprets the Torah</b> inappropriately, since with that statement he repudiates the Torah itself, <b>as it is written: “If not for My covenant, I would not have appointed day and night, the laws of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). The eternal covenant of the Torah is responsible for maintaining the existence of the entire world. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: From here too conclude</b> the same concept <b>from it, as it is stated:</b> “If I find in Sodom fifty just men within the city, <b>then I will spare the entire place for their sakes”</b> (Genesis 18:26). The righteous protect the place where they reside. |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | blessing recites: Who has made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise converts, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant, the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed” | Shabbat 137b:8 | <b>One who circumcises converts says: Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision. And the one who recites the</b> additional <b>blessing recites: Who has made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise converts, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant, the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25), which is interpreted to mean that were it not for the covenant of circumcision that is manifest both day and night, the world would cease to exist. He concludes the blessing with the phrase: <b>Blessed are You, Lord, Who establishes the covenant.</b> |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise slaves, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed” | Shabbat 137b:9 | When a Jew buys a Canaanite slave, he is obligated to circumcise the slave, as the slave is partially entering the covenant of the Jewish people. <b>One who circumcises slaves recites</b> a blessing: <b>Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision. And the one who recites the additional blessings says</b> a blessing similar to those mentioned above: <b>Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise slaves, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). <b>Blessed are You, Lord, Who establishes the covenant.</b> |
| Jeremiah 33:25 | And covenant means nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, | Shabbat 33a:2 | Furthermore, the Sages said that <b>due to the sin of delay of justice,</b> i.e., judges delay issuing their rulings due to personal considerations, <b>and</b> for <b>distortion of justice,</b> i.e., judges intentionally distort their verdicts, <b>and</b> for <b>miscarriage of justice</b> that results from negligence, <b>and</b> for <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, violence and looting abound</b> in the world, <b>and pestilence and famine come, and people eat and are not sated, and they eat their bread</b> measured <b>by weight. As it is written: “And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant;</b> and you shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy” (Leviticus 26:25). <b>And covenant means nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night,</b> if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). The study of Torah is the mitzva practiced both day and night. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to this punishment: <b>“When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake</b> your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied” (Leviticus 26:26). <b>And it is written: “Even because they rejected My ordinances,</b> and their soul abhorred My statutes” (Leviticus 26:43). All of these punishments result from breaching the covenant of the Torah and the perversion of justice. |
| Jeremiah 34:5 | “You shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings | Avodah Zarah11a:11 | Having mentioned this <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>One burns</b> items <b>due to the</b> death of <b>kings</b> as an expression of grief, <b>and</b> this <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of imitating <b>the ways of the Amorites,</b> since it is a Jewish custom. <b>As it is stated</b> that Jeremiah prophesied to Zedekiah king of Judah: <b>“You shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings</b> that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you” (Jeremiah 34:5). <b>And just as one burns</b> items <b>upon</b> the death of <b>the kings, so too one burns</b> items <b>upon</b> the death of <b>the heads of the Sanhedrin.</b> |
| Jeremiah 34:5 | “But you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you” | Moed Katan28b:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya answered and said:</b> With regard to King Zedekiah, the verse states: <b>“But you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you”</b> (Jeremiah 34:5). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Zedekiah, king of Judea, who had performed</b> only <b>one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>for he had Jeremiah lifted out of the mire</b> (Jeremiah 38:10), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about him, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael all the more so</b> should they be rewarded by dying in peace. |
| Jeremiah 34:5 | “You shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they will eulogize you, saying: Ah, master” | Sanhedrin 46b:24 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from what Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: <b>“You shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they will eulogize you, saying: Ah, master”</b> (Jeremiah 34:5). <b>And if you say</b> that a eulogy <b>is</b> delivered <b>due to the honor of the living</b> relatives of the deceased, <b>what difference does it make to him</b> if he is eulogized? The Gemara answers: It is possible that a eulogy is to honor the living, and <b>this</b> is what Jeremiah <b>is saying to</b> Zedekiah: Enjoy the thought that <b>Israel shall be honored through you</b> at your funeral just <b>as they were honored through your ancestors</b> at their funerals. |
| Jeremiah 34:5 | is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And with the burnings of your fathers, | Sanhedrin 52b:11 | <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that a Jewish custom is not forbidden even if the gentiles have the same custom, then <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>One burns</b> vessels and clothes <b>over</b> the deaths of <b>kings</b> as an expression of grief, <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> forbidden <b>for</b> being <b>of the ways of the Amorites. How can we perform</b> this <b>burning? But isn’t it written: “And you shall not follow their statutes”? Rather, since burning</b> items over the death of a king <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And with the burnings of your fathers,</b> the first kings who came before you, so shall they make a burning for you” (Jeremiah 34:5), it is <b>not from</b> the gentiles that <b>we learn</b> it. <b>And here too, since</b> decapitation by the <b>sword is written in the Torah,</b> it is <b>not from them</b> that <b>we learn</b> it. |
| Jeremiah 34:10 | “And they listened and let them go” | Arakhin 33a:4 | The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse was not stated by Jeremiah in the form of a command; rather, it <b>is written in</b> the form of <b>reproof.</b> That is, the <b>prophet</b> Jeremiah is <b>saying</b> to the Jewish people: <b>Did you send</b> free the pierced slaves when the Jubilee Year was observed? The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> there: <b>“And they listened and let them go”</b> (Jeremiah 34:10)? Evidently, the entire passage is referring to matters occurring in the present. |
| Jeremiah 34:14 | “At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold unto you, | Arakhin 33a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And did they not count Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years once the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Jeremiah, who lived many years later, said: <b>“At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold unto you,</b> and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you; but your fathers did not listen unto Me, nor inclined their ear” (Jeremiah 34:14)? |
| Jeremiah 36:18 | “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll” | Bava Batra15a:5 | <b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <b>Rather, until this point the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated</b> after Him <b>and wrote</b> the text. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with respect to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears.</b> The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <b>later, as it is stated</b> concerning the writing of the Prophets: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18). |
| Jeremiah 36:18 | and it is written there: “Then Baruch answered them: He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink on the parchment” | Megillah 19a:3 | The mishna concludes: He does not fulfill his obligation unless the Megilla is written <b>“upon parchment and with ink.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of <b>writing</b> and another instance of <b>writing. It is written here</b> in the book of Esther: <b>“Then Esther the queen,</b> the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, <b>wrote</b> all the acts of power, to confirm this second letter of Purim” (Esther 9:29), <b>and it is written there: “Then Baruch answered them: He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink on the parchment”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18). Just as there the writing was with ink on parchment, so too here, a Megilla must be written with ink on parchment. |
| Jeremiah 36:18 | “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll” | Menachot 30a:8 | Rabbi Shimon explains: <b>Rather, until this</b> point, i.e., the verse describing the death of Moses, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote</b> the text <b>and repeated</b> after Him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with regard to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears</b> without repeating the words, due to his great sorrow. <b>As it is stated there</b> with regard to Jeremiah’s dictation of the prophecy of the destruction of the Temple to Baruch ben Neriah: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18), but he did not repeat the words after Jeremiah. |
| Jeremiah 36:18 | as it is stated below: “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll” | Menachot 34a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let us see to which it is similar,</b> i.e., which comparison appears more apt. <b>We derive writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations,</b> i.e., that of a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>from</b> another <b>writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations, but we do not derive writing that is performed in</b> all <b>generations from writing that is not performed in</b> all <b>generations. And</b> furthermore, a <i>mezuza</i> must be written with ink, <b>as it is stated below: “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18). |
| Jeremiah 36:22 | “And the hearth [ aḥ ] was burning before him” | Shabbat 20a:8 | Along the same lines, the Gemara cites a different verse that discusses burning fire, as it relates to King Jehoiakim: <b>“And the hearth [<i>aḥ</i>] was burning before him”</b> (Jeremiah 36:22). <i>Amora’im</i> disputed the question: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>aḥ</i> </b>mentioned in the verse? <b>Rav said</b> that it means <b>willow branch</b> [<b><i>aḥvana</i>]. And Shmuel said:</b> It is referring to <b>wood that was lit with <i>aḥvana</i>,</b> meaning with fraternity [<i>aḥva</i>], i.e., that each piece of wood is lit from another, even small ones from large ones. The meaning of the word <i>aḥvana</i> was forgotten; the Gemara relates that <b>this</b> man, <b>who said to</b> people in the marketplace: <b>Who wants <i>aḥvana</i>? And he was found</b> to be selling <b>willow,</b> and therefore, the meaning of the word was understood. |
| Jeremiah 36:23 | a Torah scroll has been burned? As it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he would cut it with a penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier” | Moed Katan26a:15 | § <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments when <b>a Torah scroll has been burned? As it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he would cut it with a penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier”</b> (Jeremiah 36:23). With regard to the verse itself the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“three or four leaves,”</b> and why did he cut the book only at that point? |
| Jeremiah 36:24 | and burned them in fire. This is as it is written: “Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, | Moed Katan26a:17 | They read him an additional verse: <b>“Her adversaries have become the chief”</b> (Lamentations 1:5), i.e., the reigning king will be removed from power. Once he heard this, <b>he said to them: Who said</b> this? They said to him: This is the continuation of the verse: <b>“For the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions”</b> (Lamentations 1:5). <b>Immediately, he cut out all the names</b> of God <b>from</b> the book <b>and burned them in fire. This is as it is written: “Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,</b> neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words” (Jeremiah 36:24). <b>By inference,</b> this shows <b>that</b> they <b>were required to rend</b> their clothing when they saw this. |
| Jeremiah 36:27 | after the king had burned the scroll and the words” | Moed Katan26a:19 | <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: One who sees a Torah scroll that was torn is obligated to make two rents, one for the parchment</b> that was damaged <b>and one for the writing, as it is stated:</b> “Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, <b>after the king had burned the scroll and the words”</b> (Jeremiah 36:27). This implies that a separate rent must be made for each of them, both the parchment and the writing. |
| Jeremiah 37:14 | laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes” | Sotah 42a:1 | <b>“And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying: You shall fall to the Chaldeans. Then Jeremiah said: It is false; I shall not fall to the Chaldeans”</b> (Jeremiah 37:13–14). <b>And it is</b> then <b>written: “So</b> Irijah <b>laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes”</b> (Jeremiah 37:14). Irijah was the grandson of Hananiah, and Jeremiah was punished by falling into his hands because he had flattered his grandfather. |
| Jeremiah 38:7 | “Now when Ebed-Melech the Cushite heard” | Moed Katan16b:19 | The Gemara notes: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: “And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses <b>due to the Cushite woman whom he had married,</b> for he had taken a Cushite woman” (Numbers 12:1). <b>But is her name Cushite? Zipporah is her name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zipporah was distinguished by her actions.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: <b>“Now when Ebed-Melech the Cushite heard”</b> (Jeremiah 38:7). <b>Is his name Cushite? Zedekiah is his name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zedekiah was distinguished by his</b> righteous <b>actions.</b> |
| Jeremiah 38:10 | for he had Jeremiah lifted out of the mire | Moed Katan28b:16 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya answered and said:</b> With regard to King Zedekiah, the verse states: <b>“But you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before you, so shall they make a burning for you”</b> (Jeremiah 34:5). <b>Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If, with regard to Zedekiah, king of Judea, who had performed</b> only <b>one mitzva</b> that is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, <b>for he had Jeremiah lifted out of the mire</b> (Jeremiah 38:10), <b>this</b> was nevertheless stated about him, then with regard to <b>the sons of Rabbi Yishmael all the more so</b> should they be rewarded by dying in peace. |
| Jeremiah 39:3 | “And all the princes of the king of Babylonia came in and sat in the middle gate [ sha’ar hattavekh ]” | Sanhedrin 103a:9 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And all the princes of the king of Babylonia came in and sat in the middle gate [<i>sha’ar hattavekh</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 39:3), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> <i>Sha’ar hattavekh</i> was <b>the place in which they</b> would <b>decide [<i>meḥattekhin</i>] <i>halakhot</i>. Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: In the place that the master</b> of the house <b>hangs his weapons, there the despicable shepherd hangs his jug.</b> In the place where the Sanhedrin convened, Nebuchadnezzar the wicked and his princes now assemble. |
| Jeremiah 39:7 | it is written: “And he put out Zedekiah’s eyes” | Moed Katan28b:20 | The Gemara discusses issues in the aforementioned verses: <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written with regard to Zedekiah: “You shall die in peace,” but</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “And he put out Zedekiah’s eyes”</b> (Jeremiah 39:7). Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> The first verse: “You shall die in peace,” means <b>that Nebuchadnezzar died in</b> Zedekiah’s <b>lifetime</b> and consequently the latter died in peace, having seen the death of the wicked. |
| Jeremiah 40:1 | as it is written: “And he was bound with chains [ bazikim ]” | Rosh Hashanah23b:9 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the correct reading of the mishna? Did <b>we learn: Beit Ya’zek, or</b> did <b>we learn: Beit Yazek?</b> The Gemara explains the difference between these two versions. <b>Did we learn: Beit Ya’zek,</b> which is <b>an lofty term,</b> indicating that it was a fine place where the witnesses had a pleasant experience, <b>as it is written: “And he dug it [<i>vaye’azzekehu</i>] and cleared it of stones”</b> (Isaiah 5:2), which shows that the root <i>a-z-k</i> denotes improvement? <b>Or perhaps we learned: Beit Yazek,</b> which <b>is a term of distress,</b> reflecting the fact that the witnesses who arrived there on Shabbat were not permitted to move from there all day, <b>as it is written: “And he was bound with chains [<i>bazikim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 40:1). |
| Jeremiah 40:3 | “The Lord has brought it, and done according as He has said; because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this matter is come upon you” | Bava Batra10b:11 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said: We still need</b> to hear what <b>the Moda’i</b> has to say, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer HaModa’i says: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth.” “But the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> means that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only to taunt us with them, as it is stated</b> that the Babylonian officer Nebuzaradan said: <b>“The Lord has brought it, and done according as He has said; because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this matter is come upon you”</b> (Jeremiah 40:3). |
| Jeremiah 40:10 | the verse states: “And dwell in your cities that you have taken” | Kiddushin 26a:10 | § The mishna further teaches that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And dwell in your cities that you have taken”</b> (Jeremiah 40:10). <b>In what</b> manner <b>have you taken</b> these cities? They are taken <b>by dwelling,</b> which indicates that taking possession of a plot of land and dwelling there is an act demonstrating ownership, and it is itself a valid act of acquisition. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different proof: <b>“And you shall possess it and dwell there”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:31). <b>How have you possessed</b> it? You have done so <b>by dwelling</b> there. This teaches that land can be acquired through an act that demonstrates ownership. |
| Jeremiah 41:1 | “And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama” | Megillah 15a:3 | <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> With regard to <b>anyone whose actions and the actions of his ancestors are obscured</b> and not explained, <b>and the verse mentioned one of them favorably, for example,</b> the way in which Zephaniah the prophet is introduced: <b>“The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah”</b> (Zephaniah 1:1), <b>it is known that</b> not only <b>was he a righteous man,</b> he was also <b>the son of a righteous man. And</b> conversely, <b>whenever the verse mentioned one of them unfavorably, for example,</b> in the verse that introduces Ishmael as the one who killed Gedaliah, which states: <b>“And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama”</b> (Jeremiah 41:1), <b>it is known that</b> not only <b>was he a wicked man,</b> he was also <b>the son of a wicked man.</b> |
| Jeremiah 41:5 | As it is written: “There came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty people, their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring to the house of the Lord” | Moed Katan26a:22 | § <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments upon seeing <b>the cities of Judea</b> in ruin? <b>As it is written: “There came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty people, their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring to the house of the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 41:5). This indicates that they rent their garments upon seeing the destruction. |
| Jeremiah 41:9 | the pit that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with corpses, as it is written: “Now the pit where Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah | Niddah 61a:14 | It is <b>taught: That</b> pit that they found is <b>the pit that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with corpses, as it is written: “Now the pit where Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah</b> was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with them that were slain” (Jeremiah 41:9). |
| Jeremiah 42:2 | fortune, a little would have been left for me, as it is written: “For we are left but a few from many” | Bava Metzia106a:5 | The Gemara responds: It <b>stands to reason that</b> the owner can <b>say to</b> the tenant: <b>If</b> it was <b>due to my</b> bad <b>fortune, a little would have been left for me, as it is written: “For we are left but a few from many”</b> (Jeremiah 42:2), which indicates that even one suffering from misfortune does not lose all he has. |
| Jeremiah 43:10 | “Nebuchadnezzar, my slave” | Sanhedrin 105a:4 | <b>And that is what Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “David, My slave”</b> (II Samuel 3:18), and: <b>“Nebuchadnezzar, my slave”</b> (Jeremiah 43:10)? How can the wicked Nebuchadnezzar be depicted as a slave of God in the same manner that David was depicted? Rather, <b>it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being, that the Jewish people are destined to say that</b> God sold them to the nations and they no longer have ties to Him. <b>Therefore, the Holy One, Blessed be He, preemptively called</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>His slave.</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a slave who acquires property, the slave</b> belongs <b>to whom</b> and <b>the property</b> belongs <b>to whom?</b> They both belong to the master, in this case, the Holy One, Blessed be He. |
| Jeremiah 44:17 | as it is stated: “For we were sated with our bread and were well, and saw no evil” | Shabbat 152a:4 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Kisma says:</b> The <b>two</b> feet of one’s youth <b>are better than the three</b> of old age, when one walks with a cane. <b>Woe to the one who goes and does not come</b> back. <b>What is this</b> referring to? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Youth.</b> Similarly, <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: Youth is a crown of roses; old age is a crown of thorns.</b> The Sage <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Grind</b> food <b>with your teeth and</b> you will <b>find in your feet</b> the strength to carry your body, <b>as it is stated: “For we were sated with our bread and were well, and saw no evil”</b> (Jeremiah 44:17). <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Large-toothed one; untie your sack,</b> that is, your mouth, <b>and insert your food. Until</b> the age of <b>forty years, food is beneficial; from here and on, drinking is beneficial.</b> |
| Jeremiah 46:17 | As it is written: “They did cry there, Pharaoh, king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed… | Moed Katan16a:4 | From where is it derived that the defendant must be told that he is being summoned to appear <b>before a great man? As it is written:</b> “And Moses said to Korah: Be you and all your congregation <b>before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that the summons must mention the names of both parties: <b>You and so-and-so,</b> the plaintiff? <b>As it is written: “You, and they, and Aaron”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived <b>that we set a date</b> for the court proceedings? <b>As it is written: “Tomorrow”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that a second <b>date</b> must be set <b>after</b> the first <b>date,</b> if the defendant did not heed the first summons? <b>As it is written: “They did cry there, Pharaoh, king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed…</b>Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come” (Jeremiah 46:17). Although a time had been appointed and it had passed, it was not canceled entirely but pushed off to a later date. |
| Jeremiah 46:18 | reestablished in Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “Surely, like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come” | Megillah 29a:9 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar says: In the future, the synagogues and the study halls in Babylonia will be</b> transported and <b>reestablished in Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “Surely, like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come”</b> (Jeremiah 46:18). There is a tradition that these mountains came to Sinai at the giving of the Torah and demanded that the Torah should be given upon them. <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> argument: <b>Just as Tabor and Carmel, which came only momentarily to study Torah, were</b> relocated and <b>established in Eretz Yisrael</b> in reward for their actions, <b>all the more so</b> should <b>the synagogues and study halls</b> in Babylonia, <b>in which the Torah is read and disseminated,</b> be relocated to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Jeremiah 46:20 | “Egypt is a very fair heifer, but the keretz out of north is come, it is come” | Yoma 32b:12 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>They brought him the</b> sheep for <b>the daily</b> morning <b>offering, which he slaughtered [<i>keratzo</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>keratzo</i>? Ulla said: It is a term</b> meaning <b>killing. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What is the verse</b> that indicates this meaning? It is stated: <b>“Egypt is a very fair heifer, but the <i>keretz</i> out of north is come, it is come”</b> (Jeremiah 46:20). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it be <b>inferred</b> that <i>keretz</i> means killing? The Gemara explains: It is <b>as translated by Rav Yosef: Egypt is a fair kingdom, but murderous nations will come upon it from the north.</b> The Gemara asks: When he <b>slaughtered</b> the sheep, <b>to what extent</b> did he do so? <b>Ulla said:</b> He slaughtered the animal <b>with</b> a cut through <b>the majority of</b> each of the <b>two</b> organs, the windpipe and the gullet, which is sufficient to render the animal ritually slaughtered. |
| Jeremiah 47:3 | and so it says: “The fathers look not back to their children because of feebleness [ rifyon ] of hands” | Bekhorot 5b:4 | Rabbi Ḥanina continues: <b>And furthermore, I</b> also <b>asked</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the term: “Rephidim,”</b> in the verse: “Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim” (Exodus 17:8)? <b>And he said to me</b> that <b>Rephidim</b> was <b>its name,</b> i.e., of the location. The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its</b> actual <b>name</b> was <b>Rephidim. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>became lax [<i>rippu</i>] with regard to the statements of the Torah</b> in Rephidim, <b>and so it says: “The fathers look not back to their children because of feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3). |
| Jeremiah 47:3 | matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The fathers do not look back to their children from feebleness [ rifyon ] of hands” | Sanhedrin 106a:14 | Apropos the homiletic interpretation of the names of places, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the connotation of the <b>term Rephidim</b> (see Exodus 19:2)? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Rephidim</b> is <b>the name of</b> the place. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is an allusion to the fact <b>that they enfeebled [<i>rippu</i>] themselves with regard to</b> engaging in <b>matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The fathers do not look back to their children from feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3). There too, the connotation of the name is dereliction in the study of Torah. |
| Jeremiah 48:10 | said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord with a slack hand” | Bava Batra21b:2 | Joab <b>took a sword to kill him.</b> The teacher <b>said to him: Why</b> do you want to kill me? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord with a slack hand”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10), and you taught me incorrectly. The teacher <b>said to him: Leave that man to remain as cursed.</b> This is a sufficient punishment; there is no need to kill me. Joab <b>said to him: It is</b> also <b>written: “And cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10). <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Joab <b>killed him, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he did not kill him.</b> In any event, this episode demonstrates that an error learned in one’s childhood stays with him his whole life. |
| Jeremiah 48:11 | For it is written: “Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into exile; therefore his taste has remained in him, and his scent is not changed” | Megillah 12b:8 | <b>And</b> they provided a good <b>reason</b> when <b>they spoke to him,</b> as they proved that one who is settled retains his reasoning: <b>For it is written: “Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into exile; therefore his taste has remained in him, and his scent is not changed”</b> (Jeremiah 48:11). Ahasuerus <b>immediately</b> acted on their advice and asked his advisors, as it is written: <b>“And next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,</b> Meres, Marsena, and Memucan” (Esther 1:14). |
| Jeremiah 48:11 | and did not go into captivity; | Shabbat 145b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan woke up</b> due to their discussion <b>and said to them:</b> You <b>children, did I not tell you this,</b> that the verse <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kin” (Proverbs 7:4) means that <b>if the matter is as clear to you as</b> the fact that <b>your sister is forbidden to you, say it, and if not, do not say it;</b> and these explanations that you offered are unfounded. <b>They said to him: Then will the Master tell us</b> the answers to <b>some of them?</b> He said to them: <b>Why are</b> the <b>fowl in Babylonia fatter</b> than those in Eretz Yisrael? <b>Because they were not exiled, as it says: “Moab has been at ease since his youth and he has settled on his lees,</b> and he was not emptied from vessel to vessel <b>and did not go into captivity;</b> therefore his taste remained in him and his scent did not change” (Jeremiah 48:11). Apparently, one who is not exiled retains his strength. |
| Jeremiah 49:6 | But wasn’t it already stated: “But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says the Lord” | Berakhot 28a:7 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 49:6) <b>and they have already returned</b> to their land? Therefore, he is an ethnic Ammonite and he may not convert. |
| Jeremiah 49:7 | Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?” | Chagigah 5b:5 | The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was dying, the Sages said to him: What will become of us, from</b> the threat of <b>the heretics,</b> when there is no scholar like you who can refute them? <b>He said to them</b> that the verse states: “Is wisdom no more in Teiman? <b>Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?”</b> (Jeremiah 49:7). He explained: <b>Since counsel has perished from the prudent,</b> from the Jewish people, the <b>wisdom of the nations of the world has vanished</b> as well, and there will be no superior scholars among them. |
| Jeremiah 49:11 | “Leave your fatherless children, I will rear them” | Bava Metzia84a:15 | As a result of the quarrel, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was offended,</b> which in turn affected <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who <b>fell ill.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <b>sister,</b> who was Reish Lakish’s wife, <b>came crying</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan, begging that he pray for Reish Lakish’s recovery. <b>She said to him: Do</b> this <b>for the sake of my children,</b> so that they should have a father. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her</b> the verse: <b>“Leave your fatherless children, I will rear them”</b> (Jeremiah 49:11), i.e., I will take care of them. She said to him: <b>Do</b> so <b>for the sake of my widowhood. He said to her</b> the rest of the verse: <b>“And let your widows trust in Me.”</b> |
| Jeremiah 49:16 | “Your terribleness has deceived you, even the pride of your heart” | Sanhedrin 89a:18 | An example of identical content expressed in different styles is the prophecy where <b>Obadiah said: “The pride of your heart has beguiled you”</b> (Obadiah 1:3), and <b>Jeremiah said</b> a similar message employing slightly different language: <b>“Your terribleness has deceived you, even the pride of your heart”</b> (Jeremiah 49:16). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these</b> false prophets, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> in their case <b>all</b> the prophets <b>are saying</b> their prophecies <b>like each other,</b> i.e., employing an identical style, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>they are saying nothing</b> of substance and that it is a false prophecy. |
| Jeremiah 49:20 | said: Rome is destined to fall into the hands of Persia, as it is stated: “Now hear the plan that the Lord has devised for Edom, and the thoughts He has considered for the residents of Teiman. Surely the youngest of the flock will drag them away, surely their habitation will be appalled due to them” | Yoma 10a:7 | § Apropos the opinion that Tiras is Persia, the Gemara addresses a related matter. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Rome is destined to fall into the hands of Persia, as it is stated: “Now hear the plan that the Lord has devised for Edom, and the thoughts He has considered for the residents of Teiman. Surely the youngest of the flock will drag them away, surely their habitation will be appalled due to them”</b> (Jeremiah 49:20). |
| Jeremiah 49:35 | and saying: “So says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, | Sanhedrin 89a:20 | § The mishna lists among those liable to be executed as false prophets <b>one who prophesies that which was not stated to him.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>For example, Hananiah, son of Azzur, as Jeremiah was standing in the upper market</b> in Jerusalem <b>and saying: “So says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,</b> the chief of their might” (Jeremiah 49:35). <b>Hananiah raised an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>himself: If,</b> with regard to <b>Elam, which came only to assist Babylonia, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,” all the more so</b> are <b>the Chaldeans,</b> i.e., the Babylonians, <b>themselves,</b> destined to fall. Hananiah <b>came to the lower market</b> and <b>said: “So speaks the Lord</b> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: <b>I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon”</b> (Jeremiah 28:2). As a result, Hananiah, son of Azzur, was killed at the hand of Heaven (Jeremiah 28:16). |
| Jeremiah 49:38 | Rabba bar Oferan introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy from there the king and the princes, says the Lord” | Megillah 10b:29 | <b>Rabba bar Oferan introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy from there the king and the princes, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 49:38). <b>“The king”</b> who was destroyed; <b>this is</b> referring to <b>Vashti. “And the princes”; this is</b> referring to <b>Haman and his ten sons.</b> |
| Jeremiah 50:12 | multitudes of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed, | Berakhot 58a:2 | <b>And Rav Hamnuna said: One who sees multitudes of Israel,</b> six hundred thousand Jews, <b>recites: Blessed…Who knows all secrets.</b> One who sees <b>multitudes of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed,</b> she that bore you shall be confounded; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert” (Jeremiah 50:12). |
| Jeremiah 50:12 | graves of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed, | Berakhot 58b:5 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sees graves of Israel recites:</b> <br><b>Blessed…Who formed you in judgment,</b><br><b>and Who nourished you in judgment,</b><br><b>and Who sustained you in judgment,</b><br><b>and collected</b> your soul <b>in judgment,</b><br><b>and in the future will raise you</b> from the dead <b>in judgment.</b><br>And <b>Mar, son of Ravina, concludes</b> the formula of this blessing <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b><br><b>And Who knows the number of you all,</b><br><b>and Who in the future will restore you to life and sustain you.</b><br><b>Blessed…Who revives the dead.</b><br>One who sees <b>graves of gentiles recites: “Your mother shall be sore ashamed,</b> she who bore you shall be confounded; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert” (Jeremiah 50:12). |
| Jeremiah 50:29 | escape” | Nedarim 37b:9 | Words that are <b>read but not written</b> are included in the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. For example, the word <b>“Euphrates” that</b> is in the phrase <b>“as he went</b> to establish his control over the river Euphrates” (II Samuel 8:3) is not written in the text of the Bible. The same is true for the word <b>“man” that</b> is in the verse “now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, <b>was as if a man inquired of the word of God”</b> (II Samuel 16:23); and for the word <b>“come” that</b> is in the verse “behold, the days come, says the Lord, that the city <b>shall be built</b> to the Lord from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner” (Jeremiah 31:37); and for <b>“her” that</b> is in the phrase “let her not have <b>escape”</b> (Jeremiah 50:29); <b>unto that</b> is in the verse “it has <b>been told me,</b> all that you have done unto your mother-in-law” (Ruth 2:11); and for <b>“to me” that</b> is found in the passage “and she said unto her: All that you say to me I will do. And she went down to <b>the threshing floor”</b> (Ruth 3:4–5); and for <b>“to me” that</b> is in the verse “he gave me these six measures of <b>barley;</b> for he said to me” (Ruth 3:17). <b>These</b> words <b>are read but not written.</b> |
| Jeremiah 50:36 | that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [ habaddim ], and they shall become fools [ noalu ]” | Berakhot 63b:12 | The Gemara interprets the word <b><i>hasket</i></b> in this verse homiletically, as an acronym of the words <i>as</i>, make, and <i>kat</i>, group. <b>Form [<i>asu</i>] many groups [<i>kitot</i>] and study Torah, for the Torah is only acquired</b> through study <b>in a group.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina; as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? This verse can be interpreted homiletically: <b>A sword upon the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for the Torah scholars themselves, <b>who sit alone [<i>bad bevad</i>] and study Torah. And furthermore,</b> those who study alone <b>grow foolish, as it is written here, <i>noalu</i>, and elsewhere it is written</b> that after Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, Aaron told Moses: <b>“For that we have done foolishly [<i>noalnu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>And furthermore, they sin</b> due to that ignorance, <b>as</b> at the end of that same verse <b>it is stated:</b> “For that we have done foolishly, <b>and for that we have sinned.”</b> |
| Jeremiah 50:36 | which is written: “A sword is upon the baddim , veno’alu ” | Makkot 10a:20 | <b>Rav Ashi says: Anyone who loves to study in abundance,</b> i.e., with many colleagues, <b>to him shall be increase,</b> i.e., he will succeed in his studies. <b>And that is</b> parallel to that <b>which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A sword is upon the <i>baddim</i>, <i>veno’alu</i>”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? It is fitting that <b>a sword</b> be placed <b>on the necks of the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for Torah scholars, <b>who sit and engage in</b> the study of <b>the Torah individually [<i>bad bevad</i>]. Moreover, they grow foolish</b> through individual study, as <b>it is written here: <i>Veno’alu</i>, and it is written there: “For we have been foolish [<i>no’alnu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>Moreover, they</b> thereby <b>sin, as it is stated</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“And for we have sinned.” And if you wish, say</b> that <b>from here</b> it is derived that <i>no’alu</i> means sinned: <b>“The ministers of Zoan have sinned [<i>no’alu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 19:13). |
| Jeremiah 50:36 | which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [ habaddim ], and they shall become fools [ noalu ]” | Taanit 7a:10 | <b>And this is what Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? This verse can be interpreted homiletically: There is a <b>sword upon the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for Torah scholars themselves, <b>who sit alone [<i>bad bevad</i>] and study Torah. And not only that, but</b> those who study by themselves <b>grow foolish</b> from their solitary Torah study, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall become fools.”</b> |
| Jeremiah 51:3 | the archer | Nedarim 38a:1 | The same is true for <b>“this” that</b> is in the verse “and this is <b>the mitzva”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:1); and for <b>“bend” that</b> is in the verse “let <b>the archer</b> bend his bow” (Jeremiah 51:3); and for <b>“five” that</b> is in the verse “and <b>the south side</b> four thousand and five hundred” (Ezekiel 48:16); and for <b>“if” that</b> is in the verse <b>“that</b> if I am <b>a near kinsman”</b> (Ruth 3:12). All <b>these are written but not read.</b> |
| Jeremiah 51:9 | which is written: “We have healed Babylonia, but she is not healed” | Sanhedrin 96b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Among the descendants of Haman</b> were those who <b>studied Torah in Bnei Brak. And even among the descendants of that wicked</b> person, Nebuchadnezzar, were those whom <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to bring beneath the wings of the Divine Presence</b> and have them convert. <b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe:</b> The <b>one who destroyed Your House and burned Your Sanctuary,</b> will <b>You introduce</b> him <b>beneath the wings of the Divine Presence?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>That is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “We have healed Babylonia, but she is not healed”</b> (Jeremiah 51:9). <b>Ulla says: This</b> verse <b>is</b> a reference to <b>Nebuchadnezzar,</b> none of whose children converted. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> This is not a reference to a person; rather, <b>these are the rivers of Babylonia, and interpret it</b> as referring to <b>the bitter saltwater rivers of Babylonia.</b> |
| Jeremiah 51:13 | “You who dwells on many waters, abundant in storehouses” | Taanit 10a:10 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> about Babylonia: <b>“You who dwells on many waters, abundant in storehouses”</b> (Jeremiah 51:13)? <b>What caused Babylonia to have storehouses full of grain? You must say</b> that it is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it resides on many waters,</b> the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers, which render its land easy to irrigate. Similarly, <b>Rav said: Babylonia is wealthy since</b> it can <b>grow crops</b> for harvest <b>even without rain. Abaye said: We hold</b> that it is better for a land to be <b>swampy</b> like Babylonia, <b>and not dry,</b> as crops in Babylonia grow all year. |
| Jeremiah 51:18 | “At the time of their punishment, they shall perish” | Sanhedrin 102a:5 | The verse states: <b>“At the time of their punishment, they shall perish”</b> (Jeremiah 51:18). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at the time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“In an acceptable time have I answered you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “in an acceptable time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for good.</b> The verse states: <b>“On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them”</b> (Exodus 32:34). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “on the day when I punish” indicates that <b>it is a time ordained for calamity.</b> The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass at that time, and Judah descended from his brothers”</b> (Genesis 38:1). It was <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The phrase “at that time” indicates that it is <b>a time ordained for calamity.</b> |
| Jeremiah 51:30 | their might has left [ nashata ], they are become as women” | Chullin 91a:19 | § The Gemara cites another statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi concerning the sciatic nerve: <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why is its name called sciatic nerve [<i>gid hanashe</i>]?</b> It is <b>because</b> the sciatic nerve <b>left [<i>nasha</i>] its place and rose. And similarly</b> the verse <b>says:</b> “The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they remain in their strongholds; <b>their might has left [<i>nashata</i>], they are become as women”</b> (Jeremiah 51:30). |
| Jeremiah 51:39 | “When they are heated, I will make feasts for them, | Megillah 15b:16 | <b>Rabba says:</b> Esther invited Haman to her banquet in order to fulfill that which is stated: <b>“Pride goes before destruction”</b> (Proverbs 16:18), which indicates that in order to destroy the wicked, one must first bring them to pride. It can be understood according to <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say</b> that she invited Haman in order to fulfill the verse: <b>“When they are heated, I will make feasts for them,</b> and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep” (Jeremiah 51:39). The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Avuh</b> once <b>happened upon Elijah</b> the Prophet and <b>said to him: In accordance with whose understanding did Esther see</b> fit to <b>act in this manner?</b> What was the true reason behind her invitation? <b>He,</b> Elijah, <b>said to him:</b> Esther was motivated by all the reasons previously mentioned and did so <b>for all</b> the reasons previously stated by <b>the <i>tanna’im</i> and all</b> the reasons stated by <b>the <i>amora’im</i>.</b> |
| Jeremiah 52:6 | But isn’t it written: “In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine was severe in the city” | Taanit 28b:12 | The mishna further taught that on the seventeenth of Tammuz <b>the city</b> walls of Jerusalem <b>were breached.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was</b> this tragedy something that occurred <b>on the seventeenth</b> of Tammuz? <b>But isn’t it written: “In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine was severe in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “Then a breach was made in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:7), which clearly indicates that the city was breached on the ninth. |
| Jeremiah 52:7 | afterward: “Then a breach was made in the city” | Taanit 28b:12 | The mishna further taught that on the seventeenth of Tammuz <b>the city</b> walls of Jerusalem <b>were breached.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was</b> this tragedy something that occurred <b>on the seventeenth</b> of Tammuz? <b>But isn’t it written: “In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine was severe in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “Then a breach was made in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:7), which clearly indicates that the city was breached on the ninth. |
| Jeremiah 52:16 | “But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen” | Shabbat 26a:3 | Since balsam oil was discussed, the Gemara cites the verse: <b>“But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen”</b> (Jeremiah 52:16). The Gemara explains the verse: With regard to <b>vinedressers, Rav Yosef taught: These</b> poorest of the land were <b>the balsam collectors</b> in the south of Eretz Yisrael, in the expanse <b>from Ein Gedi to Ramata. And</b> the <b>husbandmen; these are the trappers of the snail [<i>ḥilazon</i>],</b> from which the sky blue dye is produced in the north of the country, in the area <b>between the Promontory of Tyre and Ḥaifa.</b> Only a small number of poor people could barely eke out a living from these tasks, which involved mere gathering. |
| Jeremiah 52:31 | he conquered Jehoiakim. And it is written: “And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judea, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodach, king of Babylonia, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judea, and brought him out of prison” | Megillah 11b:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>They were exiled in the seventh</b> year <b>after</b> Nebuchadnezzar’s <b>subjugation of Jehoiakim,</b> in what was known as <b>the exile of Jehoiachin, which was</b> actually <b>the eighth</b> year <b>of Nebuchadnezzar’s</b> reign.
