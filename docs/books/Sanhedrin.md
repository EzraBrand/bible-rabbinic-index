| Sanhedrin 9:1 | as it is taught | Sotah 8a:1 | <b>She is</b> already <b>standing there</b> in the Temple courtyard, as that is where the Sanhedrin sits. The Gemara answers: This teaches <b>that they</b> would <b>bring her up and</b> would <b>bring her down</b> repeatedly <b>in order to fatigue her,</b> with the hope that her worn-down mental state will lead to her confession. This was also done with witnesses testifying in cases of capital law, <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:1): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> In cases of capital law, the <b>court brings the witnesses from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place in order to confuse them so that they will retract</b> their testimony if they are lying. |
| Sanhedrin 9:6 | But we have heard the opposite from them, as it is taught | Sotah 8a:12 | <b>But we have heard the opposite from them, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:6): Although <b>a man</b> condemned to stoning is stoned unclothed, the court <b>covers him</b> with <b>one</b> small <b>piece</b> of material <b>in front of him,</b> to obscure his genitals, and they cover <b>a woman with two</b> small <b>pieces</b> of material, <b>one in front of her and one behind her, because all of her</b> loins are <b>nakedness,</b> as her genitals are visible both from the front and from the back. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: A man is stoned</b> while <b>naked, but a woman is not stoned</b> while <b>naked,</b> but fully clothed. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is not concerned that the onlookers seeing the woman unclothed will lead to sexual thoughts, but the Rabbis are concerned about this. |
