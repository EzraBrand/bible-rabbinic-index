| Okatzin 1:1 | there | Chullin 118a:5 | §The Gemara discusses the transmission of impurity of food with regard to accessories that serve as a handle and that provide protection. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:1): With regard to <b>any</b> appendage <b>that</b> serves as <b>a handle,</b> i.e., a part that one holds while eating the food, <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> provide <b>protection,</b> the attached food becomes <b>impure</b> if the handle comes into contact with a source of impurity, <b>and</b> the handle <b>transmits impurity</b> from the attached food to other foods that come into contact with the handle. <b>But</b> the handle <b>does not join together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. |
| Okatzin 1:3 | with regard to that | Chullin 119b:24 | <b>And where was</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ela stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to that</b> which is taught in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:3): <b>An awn [<i>melai</i>] that is on top of a stalk</b> constitutes a handle for the stalk. Therefore, <b>it can become impure and impart impurity, but it does not join together</b> with the grains to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. It was asked: <b>For what</b> function <b>is an awn fit</b> such that it is considered to be a handle for the stalk? <b>Rabbi Ilai,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ela, <b>said:</b> That mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns</b> and not the case of a single awn. Therefore, the awns constitute a handle for the stalk because one can hold the awns and lift the stalk without the awns becoming detached from it. |
| Okatzin 1:5 | hear | Chullin 119a:15 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof against the opinion of Rav from that which is taught in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:5): <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya deems</b> a pod containing <b>beans</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually pure.</b> Since beans are large and do not require the protection of the pod, the pod is not considered protection for the beans and therefore does not impart impurity. <b>But he deems</b> a pod containing smaller <b>legumes</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually impure</b> if even only one grain is attached to the pod, <b>because one desires</b> the use of the pod <b>when handling</b> the legumes so that he will not damage them, and it is therefore considered protection, which imparts impurity. Apparently, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav. |
| Okatzin 1:5 | hear | Chullin 119b:7 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught in a mishna cited previously (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:5): <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya deems</b> a pod containing <b>beans</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually pure. But he deems</b> a pod containing <b>legumes</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>impure because one desires</b> the use of the pod <b>when handling</b> the legumes so that he will not damage them. Since the requisite volume for a food item to be susceptible to impurity is an egg-bulk, and the volume of one pod and its legumes is less than an egg-bulk, this statement must be discussing multiple pods joined together. Evidently, protection of food that is divided into separate sections joins together to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. |
| Okatzin 2:1 | a woman who pickles a vegetable in a pot, and some say | Sanhedrin 106b:13 | <b>Moreover, when Rav Yehuda would encounter</b> the mishna in tractate <i>Okatzin</i> that discusses the extent to which the stems of various fruits and vegetables are considered an integral part of the produce in terms of contracting ritual impurity, where the mishna discusses the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a woman who pickles a vegetable in a pot, and some say</b> when he would reach the mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:1): <b>Olives pickled with their leaves are pure,</b> because after pickling, it is no longer possible to lift the fruit by its leaves, so they are no longer considered part of the fruit; he would find it difficult to understand. <b>He would say:</b> Those are <b>the discussions between Rav and Shmuel that we see here. And we,</b> by contrast, <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Okatzin</i> in thirteen academies.</b> |
| Okatzin 2:3 | that which we learned | Chullin 118b:8 | §Previously it was derived that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity from that which is written: “On any sowing seed that is sown” (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is typical for people to take it out to the field for sowing, e.g., wheat and barley in their shells. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Yishmael objects to this</b> from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:3): <b>The protrusion of a pomegranate joins together</b> with the pomegranate to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk that is required to impart impurity, because it provides protection for the fruit. <b>But its flower does not join together</b> with the pomegranate in that regard because it does not provide protection for the fruit; rather, it provides protection for the protection of the fruit. |
| Okatzin 2:4 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 119b:3 | <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>three peels</b> surrounding <b>an onion.</b> The <b>inner</b> peel is considered like the food itself, and therefore, <b>whether whole or punctured, it joins together</b> with the onion to constitute the requisite measure to impart the impurity of food. With regard to the <b>middle</b> peel, when it is <b>whole</b> it provides protection and therefore <b>joins together</b> with the onion, but when it is <b>punctured</b> it does not provide protection and therefore <b>does not join together</b> with the onion. The <b>outer</b> peel does not join together with the onion at all, and <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, when it is whole, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, when it is punctured, it remains <b>ritually pure.</b> Evidently, the <i>halakha</i> of protection is not applied to a protection that surrounds another protection. |
| Okatzin 2:5 | hear | Chullin 119a:6 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection to the opinions of Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:5): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a femur that has an olive-bulk of flesh upon it,</b> the flesh <b>draws the entire</b> femur <b>into ritual impurity</b> if any part of the femur comes into contact with a dead creeping animal. The Sage referred to as <b>Aḥerim says: Even</b> if <b>there is only a bean-bulk</b> of flesh <b>upon</b> the femur, <b>it draws the entire</b> femur <b>into impurity.</b> |
| Okatzin 2:8 | there | Menachot 54a:7 | § The question concerning whether a meal offering is to be measured in its current, mixed state or as it was before it was mixed relates to a fundamental issue that also arises in other areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:8): <b>Meat of a calf that swelled</b> due to cooking, as the volume of calf flesh increases when it is cooked in water, <b>or meat of an old</b> animal <b>that shrank</b> due to cooking, which is what happens to meat of this type, are to be <b>measured as they are</b> in order to determine if they are the volume of an egg-bulk, in which case they can contract ritual impurity and transfer impurity of food to other items. |
| Okatzin 2:9 | said | Chullin 128a:17 | The Gemara introduces a similar dilemma. <b>Abaye says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in the mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:9): In the case of an impure <b>cucumber that one planted in</b> an unperforated <b>flowerpot,</b> such that the cucumber is considered detached from the ground and susceptible to impurity as food, <b>and</b> the cucumber <b>grew and went out beyond</b> the edge of <b>the flowerpot</b> such that part of the cucumber is overlying the ground, the entire cucumber is considered attached to the ground and therefore becomes <b>pure.</b> |
| Okatzin 3:2 | raise a contradiction | Keritot 21a:14 | § The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> the <b>blood of bipeds, as they have</b> the capacity for <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> the impurity of a corpse, <b>but they do not have</b> the capacity for <b>a light</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> since the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of food do not apply to human flesh. <b>But</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> flesh <b>from</b> a living <b>person</b> for food, there are two conditions under which it becomes impure with the impurity of food: First, the flesh <b>requires intent</b> to eat it or feed it to others, <b>and</b> second, it must <b>be rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming into contact with water or one of the other six liquids that render food items susceptible to impurity. |
| Okatzin 3:3 | hear | Bekhorot 10a:9 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>A carcass of a non-kosher animal,</b> such as a horse or donkey, found <b>in any location; or an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird or the fat</b> of a kosher animal found <b>in the villages,</b> where the local gentiles are unaccustomed to eating it, all <b>require intent</b> to consume it in order to become susceptible to the impurity of food, <b>but they do not require</b> being <b>rendered</b> susceptible to impurity by coming in contact with liquid. <b>And if you say its prohibition</b> serves as <b>its intent, why do I</b> need <b>intent?</b> All these foods are forbidden for consumption by a Jew. The Gemara responds: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> |
| Okatzin 3:3 | that which is taught | Chullin 129a:11 | Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava</b> in explanation of <b>that which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>Fat</b> forbidden in consumption for a Jew from <b>an animal carcass in the villages, requires designation</b> as food in order for it to become susceptible to contract impurity as food, <b>and</b> it must be <b>rendered susceptible</b> via contact with liquid. Rav Pappa explained: Although the forbidden fat that covers the kidney of a carcass imparts the impurity of a carcass, <b>its impurity due to</b> the impurity of the <b>kidney is not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>food can impart a severe</b> type of <b>impurity</b> and subsequently become susceptible to impurity as food. |
| Okatzin 3:3 | is necessary only for that which we learned | Keritot 21a:21 | The Gemara answers: The statement of the <i>baraita</i> that animals are susceptible to a light form of impurity after death while people are not <b>is necessary only for that which we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to the impurity of food (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>A carcass of a non-kosher animal,</b> e.g., a horse or donkey, found <b>in any location,</b> and likewise an unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird</b> found <b>in villages,</b> where there are not many people and it is unlikely to be eaten, <b>require</b> express <b>intent</b> to be eaten in order for them to be considered food and susceptible to impurity of food. But <b>they are not required</b> to come into contact with a liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. |
| Okatzin 3:3 | intent? But didn’t we learn | Niddah 50b:12 | The Gemara analyzes the case of a young kosher bird that fell into a winepress: <b>What</b> type of situation <b>are we dealing with? If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with cities,</b> where there are many people available to consume all sorts of food, including the carcass of a kosher bird, <b>why does it</b> require <b>intent? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>An unslaughtered carcass of a kosher animal in any location,</b> whether the population is large or small, <b>and the carcass of a kosher bird or the fat</b> of a kosher animal found <b>in cities [<i>bakerakim</i>], require neither intent</b> for human consumption <b>nor</b> contact with liquid for them to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? |
| Okatzin 3:4 | prepared for a spice dish. As we learned | Niddah 51b:7 | <b>Rav Ashi said: I said this <i>halakha</i> of</b> Rav Ḥisda’s <b>before Rav Kahana,</b> and he commented: <b>Do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the <b>dill</b> was prepared <b>for a spice dish</b> from the outset, which would indicate that if dill is <b>undesignated</b> then it is intended to be an ingredient <b>in a pot</b> of food. <b>Rather, undesignated dill</b> is also <b>prepared for a spice dish. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:4): With regard to <i>teruma</i> <b>dill, once it imparted flavor in a pot</b> of food and was removed from the pot, it <b>is no</b> longer <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>, and it can no</b> longer <b>become impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b> |
| Okatzin 3:5 | raises a contradiction | Niddah 51b:3 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this conclusion from a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:5), which deals with the ritual impurity of food: With regard to spices such as <b>costus, amomum, chief spices, root of crowfoot, asafoetida, peppers, and a cake of safflower,</b> although their function is merely to add taste to food, they are considered food for the purposes of the following <i>halakha</i>: They <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food. <b>But</b> they are not considered food insofar as <b>they do not become impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> |
| Okatzin 3:6 | there | Bava Metzia105a:12 | The Gemara cites a dispute from a different area of <i>halakha</i> that discusses a similar measurement: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:6) concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of food impurities: With regard to <b>unruly olives and grapes, Beit Shammai</b> hold that they become <b>susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> as they are considered food, <b>and Beit Hillel</b> hold that they do <b>not</b> become <b>susceptible to ritual impurity</b> because they are of inferior quality and are unfit for consumption. |
| Okatzin 3:8 | said | Chullin 128b:2 | The Gemara discusses a similar dilemma. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): In the case of <b>a branch of a fig</b> tree <b>that was</b> mainly <b>detached</b> from the tree <b>and</b> which remains <b>attached</b> only <b>to the bark of</b> the tree, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that the figs on the branch are considered as if they are still attached to the tree. Therefore, he <b>deems</b> them <b>not susceptible to impurity. And the Rabbis say: If</b> one is <b>able</b> to reattach the branch to the tree such that the branch can continue <b>to live</b> and produce fruit, then it is considered as if it is attached to the tree and the fruit on it is <b>not susceptible to impurity. But if not,</b> then the fruit is <b>susceptible to impurity.</b> |
| Okatzin 3:8 | As it is taught | Chullin 129b:3 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>a branch of a fig</b> tree <b>that was detached</b> from the tree <b>and</b> remains <b>attached</b> only <b>to the bark</b> of the tree, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the figs on the branch <b>not susceptible to impurity,</b> as they are considered attached to the tree. <b>And the Rabbis say: If</b> it is possible to reattach the branch to the tree and the branch <b>can</b> continue to <b>live</b> and produce fruit, then it is considered attached to the tree, and the fruit <b>is not susceptible to impurity. But if not,</b> the fruit is <b>susceptible to impurity. And we said to you,</b> Rabbi Asi: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? And you said to us: Since</b> the branch is still <b>attached</b> to the bark of the tree, it is considered <b>attached.</b> Therefore, the same logic applies to the statement of Rabbi Shimon. |
| Okatzin 3:8 | as we learned | Chullin 75a:4 | The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> in the <i>baraita</i>. The opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>fish, from when are they susceptible to impurity</b> as food? <b>Beit Shammai say: From when they are caught</b> in a trap, as at this point they are considered food, since they do not require slaughter. <b>And Beit Hillel say: From when they die. Rabbi Akiva says: From when they are no</b> longer <b>able to live.</b> |
