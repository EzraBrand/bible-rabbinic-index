| Yadayim 1:1 | but didn’t we learn | Gittin 15b:11 | The Gemara cites another case that is based on the same principle. <b>Ilfa raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to ritual washing, can one’s <b>hands</b> be <b>ritually pure in halves, or</b> can they <b>not</b> be <b>ritually pure in halves?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that two</b> people <b>wash with</b> the requisite one <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> of water, and therefore in actuality each one of them washes with only half of a quarter-<i>log</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> explicitly in a mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 1:1): <b>With</b> the amount of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>one can wash the hands of one</b> person <b>and even of two?</b> A quarter-<i>log</i> of water suffices for one person to wash his hands before eating bread, and even two may wash their hands simultaneously with this amount, if they do so in the correct manner. |
| Yadayim 1:1 | But there is | Nazir 38a:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> than ten? <b>But there is</b> also the following mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 1:1): <b>With a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water <b>one can wash the hands of one</b> person before eating bread, <b>and</b> this amount can be used <b>even for two</b> people, if they do so in the correct manner. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar, who listed ten cases, <b>does not deal</b> with <i>halakhot</i> that are subject <b>to a dispute,</b> and some Sages disagree with the ruling that two people can wash their hands with a single quarter-<i>log</i>. |
| Yadayim 2:1 | But didn’t we learn | Gittin 15b:12 | <b>But rather,</b> Ilfa is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>washed his</b> two <b>hands one by one,</b> not both hands at the same time. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>one who</b> purifies <b>one hand by washing</b> with a vessel <b>and one</b> hand <b>by immersing</b> it in a river, <b>his hands are ritually pure?</b> This mishna indicates that there is no need for both hands to be washed simultaneously. |
| Yadayim 3:1 | Yes, as it is taught | Chullin 33b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are there</b> cases where <b>hands</b> assume <b>first-degree</b> impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 3:1): If <b>one inserts his hands into a leprous house</b> (see Leviticus 14:33–53) <b>his hands</b> assume <b>first-degree</b> impurity as though his entire body entered the house; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: His hands</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity. |
| Yadayim 3:2 | tanna’im . As we learned | Chagigah 24b:4 | The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this opinion, that an impure hand affects the sacrificial food only <b>to disqualify</b> it <b>but not to render</b> it <b>impure, is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 3:2): <b>Anything that disqualifies <i>teruma</i></b> by contact with it, i.e., anything that is impure at least to the second degree, <b>renders the hands impure</b> to the <b>second</b> degree. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>a hand</b> that is impure to the second degree <b>renders its counterpart,</b> the other hand, <b>impure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua. But the Rabbis say: Hands</b> themselves <b>are</b> impure to the <b>second</b> degree, <b>and</b> that which is impure to the <b>second</b> degree <b>cannot impart</b> second-degree impurity to something else <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> food. |
