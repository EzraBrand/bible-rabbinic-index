| Bava Batra 2:4 | As it is taught | Bava Kamma70a:16 | <b>As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Batra</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: When father Ḥalafta went to study Torah with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, and some say</b> that he said: When <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> went to study <b>Torah with father</b> |
| Bava Batra 4:6 | Rabbi Yoḥanan says, | Bava Metzia80a:3 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> citing the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Batra</i> 4:6): In a case of <b>one who sells a cow to another and says to him:</b> You should know that <b>this cow</b> has defects, <b>it is accustomed to goring, it is accustomed to biting, it is a kicker, it lies down</b> habitually; <b>but</b> in reality <b>it had</b> only <b>one defect and he inserted it among the</b> list of <b>defects</b> that it did not have, <b>this is a mistaken transaction,</b> as the buyer saw that it did not have the other defects and therefore did not take seriously any of the defects the seller enumerated, including the one that the cow actually had. But if the seller stated: The animal has <b>this defect,</b> i.e., the defect that it in fact has, <b>and other defects,</b> without specifying what they were, <b>this is not a mistaken transaction.</b> |
