| Eduyyot 1:5 | But didn’t we learn | Avodah Zarah36a:4 | <b>But according to you,</b> Rav, <b>who said</b> that <b>Daniel decreed</b> a prohibition <b>upon</b> the oil of gentiles, how can this be understood? Can it be said that <b>Daniel decreed</b> it, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi came and voided</b> the decree? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:5): <b>A court cannot void the statements of another court, unless it is greater than it in wisdom and in number?</b> According to Rav, how could Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi void a decree issued by Daniel? |
| Eduyyot 1:5 | Sages came and uprooted an ordinance that was enacted by the members of the Great Assembly? Didn’t we learn | Megillah 2a:6 | The Gemara explains: <b>This is what we said,</b> i.e., this is what we meant when we asked the question: <b>Now, all of these</b> days when the Megilla may be read <b>were enacted by the members of the Great Assembly</b> when they established the holiday of Purim itself. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that the members of the Great Assembly enacted</b> only <b>the fourteenth and fifteenth</b> as days for reading the Megilla, is it possible that <b>the</b> later <b>Sages came and uprooted an ordinance that was enacted by the members of the Great Assembly? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:5) that <b>a rabbinical court cannot rescind the statements of another rabbinical court, unless it is superior to it in wisdom and in number?</b> No subsequent court was ever greater than the members of the Great Assembly, so it would be impossible for another court to rescind the enactments of the members of the Great Assembly. |
| Eduyyot 1:5 | Didn’t we learn | Moed Katan3b:9 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Abbahu, and some say</b> that it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan: How could Rabban Gamliel and his court nullify an ordinance</b> instituted by <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel,</b> who were greater authorities than they were? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:5): <b>A court cannot nullify the ruling of another</b> court <b>unless it surpasses it in wisdom and in number?</b> |
| Eduyyot 1:7 | as it is taught | Nazir 52b:7 | § The Gemara returns to the earlier discussion. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to the question of whether a spine and skull must be together to impart ritual impurity, <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:7) that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The <b>quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones,</b> which imparts impurity in a tent, can be <b>from</b> several <b>bones [<i>ha’atzamim</i>] or from two or from three</b> bones, but they cannot be from one bone. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of bones must come <b>from the</b> same <b>body,</b> either <b>from the majority of the structure</b> of the skeleton <b>or from the majority of the number</b> of 248 bones in the body. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I can establish the statement of Beit Shammai and the statement of Beit Hillel as one.</b> In other words, I can explain their opinions so that there is no dispute between them. |
| Eduyyot 1:12 | as we learned | Shevuot 32b:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is exempt where he said to</b> the wife <b>herself</b> that her husband is dead, <b>but he did not tell</b> it <b>to the court,</b> and now he denies his earlier statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:12): <b>The woman who said: My husband died, shall remarry</b> on the basis of her own testimony. Likewise, if she says: <b>My husband died, she shall enter into levirate marriage</b> with her brother-in-law on the basis of her own testimony. The fact that the witness subsequently denied knowledge of the matter does not cause her to lose her marriage contract, since she can come to the court and testify based on the statement of the witness and collect her marriage contract. |
| Eduyyot 1:14 | As we learned | Chagigah 22a:18 | The Gemara proves that it is acceptable to borrow vessels from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:14): <b>An earthenware vessel</b> of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>shields</b> all kinds of items from the ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. There are two applications of this fact: If there are objects or foods inside a tightly sealed earthenware vessel located inside a room containing a corpse, the vessel prevents the impurity from reaching the items inside it. Also, if there is a corpse in the first floor of a house and food or vessels are located in a second story of the same building, with an opening such as a skylight in the floor between the two stories, an earthenware vessel plugging up the opening will prevent the ritual impurity from spreading to the second story. This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say: It shields only food, drink, and earthenware vessels,</b> but not utensils of metal, wood, cloth, etc. |
| Eduyyot 2:3 | hear | Gittin 20b:17 | <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on what is stated in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 2:3): <b>Even he,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, who was quoted earlier in this mishna, <b>testified about a small village that was adjacent to Jerusalem, and there was an old man there who would lend</b> money <b>to all the residents of the village. And he would write</b> the documents <b>in his handwriting and others</b> would <b>sign. And the incident came before the Sages and they deemed it valid. And why</b> did they deem it valid? <b>Isn’t there a need</b> to fulfill this verse: “I took the <b>deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), requiring that the document itself be transferred from the seller to the buyer, <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> the case here, as the document attesting to the loan was in the possession of the creditor the entire time? |
| Eduyyot 2:5 | Rav Ami raised an objection | Ketubot 6b:13 | <b>Rav Ami raised an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>one who drains an abscess on Shabbat, if</b> his intent is <b>to create</b> a permanent <b>opening</b> so that the abscess will dry, <b>he is liable</b> to receive punishment for performing an action similar to the prohibited labor of building on Shabbat. <b>However, if</b> he created the opening <b>to remove pus,</b> |
| Eduyyot 3:6 | Rabbi Dosa, as it is taught | Gittin 81a:11 | The Gemara explains: <b>The earlier generations</b> is referring to <b>Beit Shammai.</b> Beit Shammai were so careful about the sanctity of the priesthood that they said, as stated in the mishna, that the writing of a bill of divorce alone renders a priest’s wife forbidden to him. <b>The later generations</b> is referring to <b>Rabbi Dosa, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 3:6): A priest’s wife who was taken <b>captive</b> may <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and there is no concern that perhaps she was raped while in captivity and thereby became forbidden to her husband and disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Dosa.</b> |
| Eduyyot 4:1 | an egg that was laid on a Festival | Beitzah 2a:1 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:1), <b>Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten</b> even on that day, <b>and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten,</b> as the Gemara will explain at length. Apropos this exceptional case, in which Beit Shammai are lenient and Beit Hillel are strict, the mishna cites additional <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals in which this unusual phenomenon occurs (<i>Yoma</i> 79b). <b>Beit Shammai say: Leaven,</b> i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, is prohibited on Passover in the measure <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for edible <b>leavened bread</b> is greater, that <b>of a large date-bulk. And Beit Hillel say:</b> For both <b>this and that,</b> the measure is that <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> |
| Eduyyot 4:2 | one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival | Beitzah 2a:2 | Furthermore, with regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:2), in which case there is a mitzva from the Torah to cover the blood after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13), <b>Beit Shammai say: He digs</b> earth <b>with a shovel and covers</b> the blood with that earth <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day. But</b> even Beit Hillel <b>concede that if one</b> already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or the bird, <b>then he should dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood. Additionally, they agree <b>that the ashes of a stove are</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for the use of covering blood, as will be explained by the Gemara. |
| Eduyyot 4:7 | raised an objection to | Kiddushin 65a:21 | Rava <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:7): If <b>one divorces his wife, and she</b> subsequently <b>lodged with him in an inn, Beit Shammai say: She does not require a second bill of divorce from him, and Beit Hillel say: She requires a second bill of divorce from him.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If there are witnesses</b> who saw them engage in sexual intercourse for the purpose of betrothal, <b>what is the reason that Beit Shammai</b> do not require a second bill of divorce? <b>If there are no witnesses, what is the reason that Beit Hillel</b> require a second bill of divorce? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> a case where there was <b>one witness</b> who saw them engage in intercourse for the purpose of betrothal? |
| Eduyyot 5:1 | Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar | Chullin 58a:10 | <b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And they concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, a <i>tereifa</i> bird can produce eggs. Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> The mishna <b>there</b> deals <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs, which existed before the bird became a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Ashi asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the mishna state: Because <b>it grew</b> in a state of prohibition? The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition. Ameimar responded: <b>Teach</b> an emended version of the mishna: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition. |
| Eduyyot 5:1 | Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar | Chullin 58a:2 | <b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And</b> all <b>agree with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, even eggs created after the bird was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> are prohibited. Ameimar said to him: <b>There,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a bird <b>that is heated by the earth,</b> i.e., that was not fertilized by a male, and the female <i>tereifa</i> is therefore the sole source of the egg. |
| Eduyyot 5:1 | As we learned | Keritot 21a:20 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): With regard to <b>the blood of</b> animal <b>carcasses, Beit Shammai deem</b> it <b>pure, and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>impure</b> just like the carcass itself, which transmits severe ritual impurity. Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> differentiate between people and animals and indicate that dead animals are susceptible to a light form of ritual impurity? |
| Eduyyot 5:6 | As we learned | Bekhorot 26a:8 | <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, since we learned</b> a mishna <b>in our preferred</b> tractate <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:6): In the case of <b>the hair of a blemished firstborn</b> animal <b>that shed</b> from the animal <b>and one placed</b> the hair <b>in a compartment, and thereafter he slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> use of the wool <b>permitted and the Rabbis deem</b> its use <b>prohibited</b> even after the animal’s death. |
| Eduyyot 6:3 | As we learned | Chullin 129b:16 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 6:3): In the case of <b>an olive-bulk of flesh that separates from a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>impure, and Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana and Rabbi Yehoshua deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> In the case of <b>a bone</b> the volume of <b>a barley-grain that separates from a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>Rabbi Neḥunya deems</b> it <b>impure, and Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> |
| Eduyyot 6:3 | raises an objection | Nazir 51b:6 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 6:3) that addresses the question of whether an olive-bulk of flesh that came from a living person imparts ritual impurity as it would were it to come from a corpse: <b>No, if you say</b> that an olive-bulk of flesh imparts impurity <b>with regard to a corpse, whose</b> <i>halakhot</i> of impurity are stringent, as <b>the majority</b> of its structure or the majority of the number of its bones, <b>or a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of its bones, <b>or</b> even <b>a full ladle of</b> its <b>dust</b> impart impurity, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that it imparts impurity <b>with regard to a living</b> person, <b>who does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the majority</b> of structure or the majority of the number of its bones, <b>nor a quarter-</b><i>kav</i>, <b>nor a full ladle of dust?</b> |
| Eduyyot 7:4 | was taught from the testimony of Rabbi Tzadok, as we learned | Zevachim 25b:12 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This mishna</b> concerning the barrel <b>was taught from the testimony of Rabbi Tzadok, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 7:4): <b>Rabbi Tzadok testified with regard to rivulets that one diverted</b> by way of a pipe made <b>with leaves of nuts that</b> their water is <b>fit</b> to be used as water of purification. <b>This was an incident in</b> the town of <b>Ohalya, and</b> an account of the <b>incident came before the Sages in the Chamber of Hewn Stone</b> in the Temple, <b>and they deemed</b> the water <b>fit.</b> |
| Eduyyot 7:7 | as we learned | Sanhedrin 87a:11 | Rav Pappa said to Rav Huna: <b>“If there shall be a matter too hard”;</b> there the <b>verse is speaking with regard to the most distinguished</b> member of <b>the court. “For you”; this is</b> referring to <b>an adviser, who knows</b> how <b>to intercalate years and establish months.</b> How is there liability in this matter for <i>karet</i> or a sin-offering? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 7:7): Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Pappeyas <b>testified that</b> the judges <b>may intercalate the year</b> throughout the <b>entire</b> month of <b>Adar, as</b> the other Sages <b>would say</b> that the judges may do so only <b>until</b> the day of <b>Purim.</b> |
| Eduyyot 8:1 | Rav Kahana raised an objection | Chagigah 23b:8 | <b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> against this based on the mishna that teaches (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1): <b>Rabbi Akiva added</b> to the list of items that are considered combined when in the same vessel <b>fine flour, incense, frankincense, and coals,</b> saying <b>that if one who immersed himself that day</b> but has not waited until sunset <b>touched</b> a <b>part</b> of the contents of a vessel containing these substances, <b>all of</b> the vessel’s contents <b>are disqualified,</b> as the vessel combines them. |
| Eduyyot 8:2 | Rava raised an objection | Ketubot 26b:8 | <b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:2): <b>Rabbi Yosei the priest and Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav testified about a Jewish woman</b> about <b>whom</b> witnesses testified that <b>she was taken as collateral</b> for a debt <b>in Ashkelon. And the members of her family,</b> who suspected that she engaged in intercourse there, <b>distanced themselves from her, but her witnesses testified about her that she neither entered into seclusion nor was violated. And the Sages said</b> to the members of the family: <b>If you deem</b> the witnesses <b>credible</b> to testify <b>that she was taken as collateral, deem</b> the witnesses <b>credible</b> to testify <b>that she neither entered into seclusion nor was violated. And if you do not deem</b> the witnesses <b>credible</b> to testify <b>that she neither entered into seclusion nor was violated, do not deem</b> the witnesses <b>credible</b> to testify <b>that she was taken as collateral</b> at all. In either case, she is permitted to her husband. |
| Eduyyot 8:3 | Abaye raised a contradiction before Rava | Ketubot 14a:4 | § <b>Abaye raised a contradiction before Rava</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:3): <b>Did Rabbi Yehoshua say that</b> the woman <b>is not deemed credible</b> and her claim is not accepted? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction: Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira testified concerning the widow</b> whose late husband was a member <b>of a</b> priestly <b>family of questionable lineage [<i>issa</i>], that she is fit to</b> marry into the <b>priesthood.</b> Since the matter is uncertain, the woman retains her presumptive status of fitness and her late husband is presumed to be of unflawed lineage. |
| Eduyyot 8:3 | tanna’im . As we learned | Kiddushin 75a:9 | The Gemara comments: This statement of Rav Ḥisda serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>these</b> following <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:3): <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira testified with regard to a widow of questionable lineage, that she is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood. What is the reason</b> for this lenient ruling? <b>It is</b> a case of <b>a compound uncertainty, and</b> the principle is that in a case of <b>a compound uncertainty</b> the ruling <b>is to be lenient.</b> |
| Eduyyot 8:4 | call us a permissive court. As we learned | Avodah Zarah37a:3 | The Gemara relates a relevant incident: <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia was traveling</b> while <b>leaning upon the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai, his attendant.</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to him: Simlai, you were not in the study hall last night when we permitted the oil</b> of gentiles. Rabbi Simlai <b>said to him: In our days, you will permit bread</b> of gentiles <b>as well.</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to him: If so,</b> people will <b>call us a permissive court. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida testified with regard to</b> the <b><i>eil kamtza</i>,</b> a type of locust, that it is <b>kosher, and with regard to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple that they are <b>ritually pure, and with regard to one who touches a corpse</b> that he is <b>impure,</b> as soon explained by the Gemara. <b>And</b> as a result, <b>they called him: Yosef the Permissive.</b> |
| Eduyyot 8:6 | tanna’im , as it is taught | Megillah 10a:6 | The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> matter <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: I heard that when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they fashioned</b> temporary <b>hangings for the Sanctuary and</b> temporary <b>hangings for the courtyard</b> to serve as partitions until construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in</b> building <b>the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the hangings, without entering, <b>and in the courtyard,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>inside</b> the hangings. |
| Eduyyot 8:6 | As it is taught | Shevuot 16a:10 | The Gemara rejects this proof: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> as to whether the initial consecration of Jerusalem and the Temple sanctified them only for their time or forever. Abba Shaul maintains that the initial consecration lapsed, and therefore the reconsecration required all of the procedures mentioned in the mishna. Where is this dispute taught? <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: I heard</b> that <b>when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they fashioned</b> temporary <b>curtains for the Sanctuary and</b> temporary <b>curtains for the courtyards</b> to serve as partitions until the construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the curtains, without entering, <b>and in the courtyards,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>within</b> the curtains. |
| Eduyyot 8:6 | the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned | Zevachim 107b:20 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> I heard that <b>when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they would fashion</b> temporary <b>curtains for the Sanctuary</b> and temporary <b>curtains for the courtyards</b> to serve as partitions until the construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the curtains, without entering, <b>and in the courtyards,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>within</b> the curtains. |
| Eduyyot 8:7 | Abaye said: We too learn | Kiddushin 71a:8 | <b>Abaye said: We too learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:7): <b>There was a family</b> known as <b>Beit HaTzerifa in Transjordan, and</b> a person called <b>ben Tziyyon forcefully distanced it</b> and proclaimed that its lineage was flawed, although its lineage was unflawed. <b>There was another</b> one <b>that ben Tziyyon forcefully drew near,</b> although its lineage was flawed. The mishna adds: Known families <b>such as these, Elijah comes to</b> declare <b>impure and to</b> declare <b>pure, to distance and to draw near.</b> Abaye continues: When the mishna states: <b>Such as these,</b> it means those <b>whose</b> status <b>we know. But a family that has become assimilated,</b> whose flawed lineage is unknown to the public, <b>has</b> already <b>become assimilated,</b> and not even Elijah will publicize its flaw. |
