| Book of Ben Sira 13:17 | is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him | Bava Kamma92b:13 | Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael”</b> (Genesis 28:9). It <b>is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him”</b> (Judges 11:3). <b>And</b> it <b>is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him</b> (Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <b>We learned</b> it <b>in a mishna</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:2): <b>All that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually impure</b> is <b>ritually impure; all that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually pure</b> is <b>ritually pure. And we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught</b> did the <b>starling go to the raven but because it is its kind,</b> as it too is a non-kosher bird. |
