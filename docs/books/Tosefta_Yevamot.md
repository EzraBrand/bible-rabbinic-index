| Tosefta Yevamot 14:1 | of Rabbi Neḥemya. As it is taught | Sotah 31b:19 | The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the correct understanding is that <b>the entire</b> mishna is not dealing with valid witnesses, and stating an obvious <i>halakha</i> in order to enable an inference, but <b>with</b> people who are <b>disqualified</b> from giving <b>testimony,</b> and is teaching us a novel ruling. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta Yevamot</i> 14:1) that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: Wherever the Torah relies on one witness, follow the majority of opinions.</b> In other words, if the testimonies of two disqualified witnesses conflict, the court rules in accordance with the version supported by more witnesses, whether or not they are qualified to testify. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>established</b> that the testimony of <b>two women,</b> who are usually disqualified from testifying, when they testify in opposition to <b>one man,</b> should be <b>like</b> that of <b>two men against one man,</b> and the court will rule in accordance with the testimony of the two women. |
