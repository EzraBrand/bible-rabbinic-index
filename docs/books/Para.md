| Para 1:3 | is an entity in and of itself, as we learned | Chullin 23a:5 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, do not raise a dilemma, as he says</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is an entity in and of itself, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): If one was obligated to bring a ram or lamb as an offering, and he <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i>, <b>he brings with it</b> the meal offering and <b>the libations of a ram</b> offering, namely, a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with four <i>log</i> of oil, and a libation of four <i>log</i> of wine, <b>but it does not fulfill his</b> obligation to bring <b>his offering.</b> |
| Para 1:3 | as we learned | Menachot 91b:17 | The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is</b> considered an independent <b>entity,</b> i.e., it is not regarded as a lamb or a ram, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): One who is obligated to sacrifice a lamb or a ram and <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i> <b>should bring with it the libations</b> that are required when bringing <b>a ram, but</b> nevertheless its sacrifice <b>is not considered</b> a fulfillment of <b>his</b> obligation to bring <b>an offering</b> of a ram or a lamb. <b>And,</b> commenting on this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the requirement to bring libations in this case is derived from the phrase <b>“or for a ram,”</b> which serves <b>to include</b> the sacrifice of <b>a <i>palges</i>.</b> |
| Para 2:1 | the Rabbis. As we learned | Avodah Zarah23a:5 | <b>Rabbi Pedat said:</b> The contradiction between the mishna, which rules that gentiles are suspected of bestiality, and the <i>baraita</i>, which permits an animal purchased from gentiles to be sacrificed as an offering, is <b>not difficult; this</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 2:1) <b>with regard to the</b> red <b>heifer of purification: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>it may not be purchased from gentiles, and the Rabbis permit</b> it to be purchased from gentiles. Rabbi Pedat explains: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to this</b> issue, <b>that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>we are concerned that</b> a person might have engaged in <b>bestiality</b> with the animal, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we are not concerned that</b> a person engaged in <b>bestiality</b> with the animal? |
| Para 2:2 | raises a contradiction | Bekhorot 44a:23 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the bones of the animal <b>were cut,</b> is the animal even rendered <b>unfit? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 2:2): With regard to a red <b>heifer whose horns and hooves are black,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>one should cut</b> away the black parts so that the heifer remains entirely red. Evidently, cutting away the horns of the heifer does not inflict a blemish upon it. <b>Ze’eiri interpreted</b> the mishna as referring to cutting the horn specifically <b>from above the bone</b> inside it. In such a case, the heifer is not disqualified. Cutting the bone itself does disqualify the animal. |
| Para 2:4 | as we learned | Bava Metzia30a:9 | The Gemara answers. <b>This is comparable only to this</b> other case, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 2:4): If <b>a bird rested upon</b> a red heifer, <b>it</b> remains <b>fit</b> for use in the purification ritual, as supporting the bird on its back is considered neither labor nor comparable to pulling a yoke. If <b>a male</b> animal <b>mounted it</b> for mating, <b>it is unfit</b> for use in the purification ritual. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the difference between the two cases? |
| Para 3:2 | raises a contradiction | Sukkah 21a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that the legal status of <b>any tent that is not established by a person is not</b> that of <b>a tent?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:2): <b>Courtyards were built in Jerusalem atop the rock, and beneath</b> these courtyards there was a <b>space</b> of at least a handbreadth <b>due to</b> the concern lest there is <b>a grave</b> in <b>the depths.</b> In that case, the space served as a barrier preventing the impurity from reaching the courtyards above. <b>And they</b> would <b>bring pregnant women, and they would give birth there</b> in those courtyards. <b>And they</b> would <b>raise their children there</b> and would not leave there with the children until they grew. All this was done so that the children would be untainted by any impurity and would be able to assist in the ritual of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer,</b> whose ashes are used to purify those impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. |
| Para 3:2 | Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan | Zevachim 113a:13 | <b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mish-na (<i>Para</i> 3:2): <b>Courtyards were built in Jerusalem on stone, and beneath</b> these courtyards there was a hollow <b>space due to</b> the concern that there was a lost <b>grave</b> in <b>the depths.</b> The space served as a barrier preventing the impurity from reaching the courtyards above. <b>And they</b> would <b>bring pregnant women, and</b> those women would <b>give birth</b> in those courtyards. <b>And</b> those women would <b>raise their children there,</b> thereby ensuring that the children never became impure. This would enable the children <b>to</b> assist in the rite of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer.</b> |
| Para 3:7 | As we learned | Chagigah 23a:14 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:7): <b>They would render impure the priest who burns the</b> red <b>heifer, in order to counter the opinion of</b> the <b>Sadducees, who used to say:</b> The ritual of the red heifer <b>was</b> to be <b>performed by those who had experienced sunset</b> after their immersion. The Sadducee opinion was that all those involved in the preparation of the red heifer must be completely pure, having undergone immersion as well as having waited until after sunset, when the purification takes full effect. The Sages, however, maintain that the red heifer may be prepared by people immediately after immersion, without waiting for sunset. In order to clearly demonstrate their rejection of the Sadducee opinion they would deliberately defile the people involved with preparing the red heifer and then immerse them. It is for this reason as well that Rabbi Yehoshua ruled that the tube must be rendered impure before it is immersed. |
| Para 3:7 | as we learned | Zevachim 21a:1 | <b>And</b> in preparation for the rite of the red <b>heifer, we</b> intentionally <b>impart impurity to</b> the priest after he has already sanctified his hands and feet, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:7): <b>They would render the priest who burns the heifer ritually impure and immerse him</b> immediately, <b>to remove</b> a misconception <b>from the hearts of</b> the <b>Sadducees</b> by means of a public display of disregard for their ruling. <b>As</b> the Sadducees <b>would say:</b> Only <b>by those for whom the sun set was</b> the heifer ritual <b>performed.</b> The Sadducees believed that it is prohibited for an impure priest who immersed that day to burn the red heifer until sunset, when the purification process is completed. The Gemara concludes: Since this impurity does not disqualify the sanctification of his hands and feet, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>impurity does not disqualify</b> sanctification of the hands and feet in general. |
| Para 3:9 | Abaye raised an objection to | Menachot 7b:18 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a mishna discussing the red heifer (<i>Para</i> 3:9): When the priest has <b>completed sprinkling</b> the blood of the red heifer toward the entrance to the Sanctuary, <b>he wipes his hand</b> from the blood <b>on the body of the heifer.</b> Abaye explains his objection: The mishna states that when the priest <b>completed</b> all the sprinklings, then <b>yes,</b> he wipes his hand. It may be inferred that if he <b>did not complete</b> the sprinklings, he does <b>not</b> wipe his hand, even though blood remains on his finger from each preceding sprinkling. This proves that the blood that remains on his finger is fit for sprinkling. |
| Para 3:9 | Abaye raised an objection to | Zevachim 93b:13 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Elazar’s opinion from what is taught about sprinkling the blood of the red heifer in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:9): When the priest has <b>concluded sprinkling</b> the blood, <b>he wipes his hand on the body of</b> the red <b>heifer.</b> Evidently, if he <b>concluded</b> sprinkling, <b>yes,</b> he does wipe his hand; but if he <b>did not conclude</b> sprinkling, he does <b>not</b> wipe his hand, even though a remainder is left on his finger. Evidently, this remainder is fit for sprinkling. Rava <b>said to him:</b> The mishna is to be understood otherwise: If he <b>concluded</b> sprinkling, <b>he wipes his</b> entire <b>hand on the body of the</b> red <b>heifer;</b> but if he <b>has not concluded</b> sprinkling, <b>he wipes</b> only <b>his finger</b> after each sprinkling. |
| Para 4:4 | Rabbi Zeira raises an objection | Chullin 29b:9 | <b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 4:4): <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> any part of the rite of the red <b>heifer</b> continuously <b>from beginning to end transmits</b> ritual <b>impurity to</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing. <b>And they disqualify</b> the red heifer for use in the rite if they perform any <b>other labor</b> while engaged in any part of the rite of the red heifer. |
| Para 5:4 | What is added | Arakhin 3a:14 | § The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone</b> is <b>fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer, i.e., to pour the water over them? The Gemara answers that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda</b> the statement serves <b>to add a minor, and according to the Rabbis,</b> who disqualify a minor, it serves <b>to add a woman. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone is fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda deems a minor fit, but deems a woman and a hermaphrodite,</b> who has both male and female characteristics, <b>unfit.</b> |
| Para 5:4 | Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned | Chagigah 23a:11 | The Gemara asks: If so, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): Regarding <b>a tube</b> of reed, <b>which one cut for</b> storing ashes of <b>purification, Rabbi Eliezer says: He should immerse</b> it <b>immediately; Rabbi Yehoshua says: He should</b> first <b>render</b> it <b>impure</b> by touching it to an actual source of impurity <b>and</b> only <b>after that immerse</b> it. <b>And we discussed</b> the mishna’s case, asking: <b>Who cut</b> this tube? <b>If we say a <i>ḥaver</i> cut it, why do I</b> need <b>immersion?</b> The <i>ḥaver</i> prepared it with the strictest adherence to the <i>halakhot</i> of purity. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>cut it.</b> But <b>in that case, would Rabbi Yehoshua say</b> that <b>he should</b> first <b>render</b> it <b>impure and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> it? <b>Isn’t it already impure,</b> due to the handling of the <i>am ha’aretz</i>? |
| Para 5:5 | raises an objection | Yevamot 72b:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Para</i> 5:5): If <b>a <i>tumtum</i> sanctified</b> the purification waters by placing a small amount of ashes from the red heifer into springwater that had been placed into a container for that purpose, <b>his sanctification is invalid because</b> there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether he is <b>uncircumcised, and an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is disqualified from sanctifying</b> the purification waters. <b>But</b> if <b>a hermaphrodite sanctified</b> the purification waters, <b>his sanctification is valid. Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says: Even</b> if <b>a hermaphrodite sanctified</b> the purification waters, <b>his sanctification is invalid, because</b> there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether a hermaphrodite is <b>a woman, and a woman is disqualified from sanctifying</b> the purification waters. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that one who is definitely <b>uncircumcised, and</b> even one about whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether he is <b>uncircumcised, is disqualified from sanctifying</b> the purification waters. |
| Para 6:1 | raises a contradiction | Sanhedrin 77b:11 | The Gemara questions the principle underlying this <i>halakha</i>. Is that <b>to say that</b> in <b>a case like this,</b> when an item caroms off the wall, the action <b>is</b> considered the result of <b>his force? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 6:1): In the case of <b>one who sanctifies</b> the waters of purification by placing the ashes of the red heifer into the water, in order to sprinkle on one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>and the sacred</b> ashes <b>fell on his hand or on the side</b> of the vessel <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter it fell into</b> the water in <b>the trough,</b> the purification waters are <b>unfit,</b> since there is a requirement that the ashes must be placed in the water by the force of his action. Likewise, when an item caroms off a wall, the action is not generated by the force of his action; therefore, he should not be liable. |
| Para 6:4 | elsewhere | Zevachim 25b:8 | The Gemara adds: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Para</i> 6:4) with regard to sanctifying the water of purification: If one <b>placed his hand or his foot or vegetable leaves in order</b> to allow flowing <b>water to pass</b> through them <b>to</b> the <b>barrel,</b> the water is <b>disqualified.</b> But if the water passed through <b>leaves of reeds or leaves of nuts,</b> the water remains <b>fit. This is the principle:</b> If the water passes through <b>an item that is susceptible to impurity,</b> it is <b>disqualified;</b> if it passes through <b>an item that is not susceptible to impurity,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> |
| Para 8:7 | As we learned | Chullin 34a:10 | Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: But aren’t</b> those <b>liquids also</b> impure with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity through contact with an item impure with second-degree impurity? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 8:7): <b>Any</b> item with second-degree ritual impurity that <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i> renders liquids impure</b> with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity. These liquids assume a degree of impurity greater than that of the item that rendered them impure. This rabbinic decree applies to all people and items with second-degree impurity <b>except</b> for <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed. Liquids with which he comes into contact follow the standard course of transmitted impurity and assume third-degree impurity, one level below his own impurity. |
| Para 8:10 | erred also with regard to this: | Sanhedrin 5b:7 | <b>And</b> the residents of that same place <b>erred also with regard to this:</b> It was taught in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 8:10): <b>The waters of</b> the <b>Keramiyyon</b> River <b>and the waters of</b> the <b>Piga</b> River <b>are not fit</b> for mixing with ashes of the red heifer to use as water of purification, <b>since they are water</b> from <b>swamps. And they</b> erroneously <b>thought: Since</b> this water <b>is not fit</b> for use as <b>water of purification,</b> this means it is not considered water, and therefore <b>it also does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting impurity. <b>But it is not so,</b> as <b>there, with regard to</b> water of <b>purification, we need: “Running water”</b> (see Numbers 19:17), and water from swamps is not running water. But <b>here,</b> with regard to <b>rendering</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>any</b> water <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible.</b> |
| Para 9:1 | there | Zevachim 80a:9 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Para</i> 9:1): With regard to <b>a flask</b> containing water of purification <b>into which any amount of</b> regular <b>water fell, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priest <b>should sprinkle two sprinklings</b> on the ritually impure person, as in this manner he ensures that he will be sprinkled with some of the water of purification; <b>but the Rabbis disqualify</b> the mixture for purification. |
| Para 9:3 | Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection | Chullin 62a:9 | § <b>Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A young <b><i>tasil</i>,</b> which is similar to a dove, is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a dove,</b> which is fit only when mature, <b>but</b> it is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a pigeon,</b> which is fit only when immature. In other words, the <i>tasil</i> is considered a type of pigeon, not a dove. A mature <b><i>datzifi</i></b> bird, <b>and</b> mature <b>doves of Reḥava, are fit as doves, but are unfit as pigeons,</b> since they are types of doves. <b>Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:3): <b>All birds</b> |
| Para 9:3 | Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection | Gittin 86b:16 | <b>Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection</b> to this ruling from the Mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:3): <b>All birds disqualify water of purification</b> by drinking from it, because some of the water spills from the bird’s beak back into the basin after being disqualified by having been in the bird’s mouth. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all birds <b>except for the pigeon, because it sucks</b> the water, which prevents it from spilling back. <b>And if it is so</b> that a <i>kartzit</i> does not disqualify water of purification, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that all birds disqualify <b>except for</b> the <b>pigeon and</b> the <b><i>kartzit</i>.</b> |
| Para 9:7 | raised an objection to | Bekhorot 23a:3 | Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:7): If the <b>ashes</b> of a red heifer, which impart ritual impurity to the priests involved in its ritual and are <b>fit</b> for sprinkling on someone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>became intermingled with</b> regular <b>burned ashes, we follow the majority</b> in order <b>to</b> determine whether or not the mixture is <b>impure. And</b> therefore, <b>if</b> the <b>majority is</b> composed of the regular <b>burned ashes,</b> the mixture does <b>not impart impurity.</b> Abaye explains the objection: <b>And if you say</b> nullified <b>impurity is considered like an item that is</b> nevertheless present in the mixture and can be revived, then <b>although</b> the mixture <b>does not impart impurity through</b> physical <b>contact</b> as it is assumed that one touches the majority, <b>let it impart impurity through carrying</b> due to the ashes of the red heifer. |
| Para 10:5 | as we learned | Zevachim 93a:5 | That is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 10:5): There is a dispute with regard to the case of a ritually pure person who <b>was standing beyond an oven,</b> which stood between him and the wall, <b>and</b> a carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which imparts impurity, was <b>in the oven; and</b> the person <b>stretched out his hand to the window and took the jug [<i>halagin</i>]</b> containing water of purification <b>and passed it over the opening of the oven. Rabbi Akiva deems</b> the water of purification <b>impure,</b> although the jug has merely passed over the oven’s opening and has not come to rest on it, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> the water <b>pure. And</b> according to Rabba, <b>in this</b> manner <b>do they disagree: That Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the jug is <b>considered as</b> if <b>resting</b> on the opening of the oven, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that the jug is <b>not considered as</b> if <b>resting</b> there. |
| Para 11:5 | As we learned | Chagigah 18b:9 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 11:5): <b>Anything that requires immersion in water by rabbinic law renders sacrificial</b> food <b>impure.</b> If it touches a consecrated item, the latter is itself rendered impure with a second-degree ritual impurity. It also renders impure any other consecrated object that comes into contact with it with a third-degree ritual impurity <b>and invalidates <i>teruma</i>,</b> meaning that it renders the <i>teruma</i> itself impure, but not to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> can render other <i>teruma</i> impure. <b>And</b> anything that requires immersion in water by rabbinic law <b>is permitted for non-sacred</b> produce <b>and for tithes,</b> meaning that it does not render these items impure, as something impure to such a low degree does not invalidate even non-sacred food. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. But the Rabbis prohibit</b> this <b>in</b> the case of <b>tithes,</b> meaning that they are invalidated. This source demonstrates that according to the Rabbis, the <i>halakha</i> that applies to tithes differs from that of non-sacred produce, which explains why one must wash his hands for tithes. <b>However,</b> the law with regard to <b>non-sacred</b> food as opposed to the other law of <b>non-sacred</b> food is still <b>difficult.</b> |
| Para 11:5 | Rabbi Meir, as we learned | Chullin 33a:14 | <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Here we are dealing with non-sacred</b> food <b>that one purchased</b> in Jerusalem <b>with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which assumes the status of the second-tithe produce. This produce, in turn, assumes third-degree impurity through contact with hands that have second-degree impurity. <b>And</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 11:5): |
| Para 11:5 | as we learned | Sotah 30a:4 | <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is of this opinion, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 11:5): <b>Anything that requires immersion in water by rabbinic law renders sacrificial</b> food <b>impure</b> upon contact, with second-degree impurity, <b>and disqualifies <i>teruma</i>,</b> meaning that it renders the <i>teruma</i> itself impure, but not to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> can render other <i>teruma</i> impure. <b>And</b> anything that requires immersion in water by rabbinic law <b>is permitted for non-sacred</b> food <b>and for</b> the second <b>tithe,</b> i.e., it does not render these items impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. But the Rabbis prohibit</b> one who has this degree of impurity from partaking of the second <b>tithe.</b> From the fact that Rabbi Meir permits him to partake of the second tithe, it is inferred that he maintains that an item of second-degree impurity cannot impart third-degree impurity upon non-sacred items. |
| Para 12:2 | hear | Sanhedrin 77b:13 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof that only an action that one generates directly is considered the force of his action, as it is taught in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:2): Concerning <b>a needle that was</b> impure with impurity imparted by a corpse and was <b>placed on an earthenware</b> shard, <b>and one sprinkled</b> water of purification; if there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether he actually <b>sprinkled</b> the purification water <b>on the needle</b> or whether he <b>sprinkled</b> it <b>on the earthenware</b> shard <b>and</b> the water inadvertently <b>sprayed upon</b> the needle, <b>his sprinkling is unfit.</b> Apparently, an action performed indirectly is not considered to have been generated by his force. |
| Para 12:2 | as we learned | Sotah 38b:21 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of people who are standing to <b>the sides</b> of the priests? Are they included in the blessing? <b>Abba Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:2) with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of sprinkling the waters of purification on vessels that contracted ritual impurity imparted by a corpse: If one <b>intended to sprinkle</b> the water <b>forward</b> |
| Para 12:5 | as it is taught | Niddah 13b:21 | In explanation of this statement, <b>Abaye says: And</b> when this <i>tanna</i> speaks of metal, he means that the pouch should be made <b>of copper,</b> which does not absorb liquid, and therefore any drop of semen would be visible. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:5), with regard to the amount of water of purification that must be sprinkled on an individual who is impure due to impurity imparted by a corpse, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One considers those hyssop stems,</b> with which the waters of purification are sprinkled, <b>as though they are</b> made <b>of copper,</b> which does not absorb any of the water. |
| Para 12:5 | As we learned | Niddah 9a:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling does not require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water, <b>that statement</b> applies only to the measure of purification water that must be sprinkled <b>onto the back,</b> i.e., onto the body, <b>of</b> the impure <b>man.</b> In this regard, any amount will suffice. <b>But with regard to the vessel</b> into which one dips the hyssop in order to sprinkle the water, it <b>requires</b> a certain <b>measure</b> of water. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:5): <b>How much</b> water must <b>be in</b> the vessel so that it <b>will be enough for sprinkling?</b> It must be <b>enough to dip the tops of the stems</b> of the hyssop branch, used in the rite of purification, into the water <b>and sprinkle</b> it. |
| Para 12:10 | What is added | Arakhin 3a:15 | The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:10): <b>Everyone is qualified to sprinkle</b> the purification waters on one who is ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse? The Gemara answers that this serves <b>to add one who is uncircumcised. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>one who is uncircumcised sprinkled</b> the purification water, <b>his sprinkling is valid.</b> |
