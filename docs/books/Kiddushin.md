| Kiddushin 3:4 | these tanna’im . As it is taught | Bava Kamma99b:3 | <b>And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as the payment is a loan, since she already owes him this money. But if he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I will work for you, she is betrothed,</b> as from the moment he is entitled to the money, he gives it to her for her betrothal. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I will work for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that upon the completion of the labor it is a loan, <b>and all the more so</b> if he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I have worked for you.</b> |
| Kiddushin 3:7 | clarification, as it is taught | Gittin 25b:5 | The Gemara elaborates: When one <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on his own decision,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification.</b> This is understood from <b>that which we said</b> in the case of wine purchased from Samaritans. When <b>one makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3:7): If a man said to a woman: <b>I am engaging in sexual intercourse with you</b> for the purpose of betrothal <b>on the condition that</b> my <b>father will desire</b> our betrothal, and then he married her without specification, then <b>even if the father did not desire</b> it <b>she is</b> nevertheless <b>betrothed</b> through this act of intercourse. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> If <b>the father desires</b> it, <b>she is betrothed,</b> |
| Kiddushin 3:7 | as it is taught | Ketubot 56a:16 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3:7): In the case of <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on the condition that you have no</b> ability to claim <b>from me food, clothing, or conjugal rights, she is betrothed and his stipulation is void;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>monetary matters,</b> such as food and clothing, <b>his stipulation stands;</b> therefore, if she verbally waives part of the marriage contract, and thereby makes a stipulation about a monetary matter, it should be effective. |
| Kiddushin 4:3 | are different ones, but isn’t it taught | Sotah 9a:9 | <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>those</b> ancient Egyptians, <b>have gone, and these</b> later Egyptians <b>are different ones, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 4:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Minyamin, an Egyptian convert, was a friend of mine from among the students of Rabbi Akiva,</b> and <b>Minyamin the Egyptian convert said:</b> After I converted <b>I</b> was <b>a first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>and</b> so <b>I married</b> another <b>first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert. <b>I will marry off my son,</b> who is <b>a second-</b>generation Egyptian convert, <b>to</b> another <b>second-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>in order that my son’s son will be permitted to enter into the congregation.</b> The Torah prohibits Egyptian converts before the third generation to enter into the congregation (see Deuteronomy 23:8–9). By Minyamin’s observance of this prohibition even during the time of Rabbi Akiva, it indicates that Egypt during the tannaitic period was still viewed as biblical Egypt. |
