| Tevul Yom 2:1 | a corpse ritually pure? And raise a contradiction | Chullin 87b:10 | <b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 4:5): <b>All liquids</b> that issue <b>from a corpse,</b> e.g., teardrops or breastmilk, <b>are ritually pure, except for its blood. And all</b> liquids that issue <b>from</b> a corpse that contain <b>a reddish hue</b> of blood <b>impart ritual impurity in a tent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But are liquids</b> that issue from <b>a corpse ritually pure? And raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>liquids</b> that issue <b>from one who immersed that day, liquids that issue from him</b> have the same status <b>as liquids that he touches.</b> |
| Tevul Yom 2:1 | as we learned | Niddah 71b:16 | The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai concede to Beit Hillel that <b>if</b> a drop <b>from her saliva</b> or from the blood of purity fell onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>, that the loaf is ritually pure, as any liquid discharged from the body of one who immersed that day is ritually pure. The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:1): The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>liquids</b> that emerge <b>from one who immersed himself that day</b> from his state of ritual impurity <b>is like</b> that of <b>liquids that he touches. And</b> both <b>these and those,</b> the liquids that emanated from him and the liquids that he touched, <b>do not transmit ritual impurity.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for liquids</b> that come <b>from a <i>zav</i>, who is a primary source of ritual impurity.</b> |
| Tevul Yom 2:3 | Abaye raised an objection to his | Nazir 36a:3 | § <b>Rav Dimi sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabbi Yoḥanan that a permitted substance does not combine with a forbidden substance except in the case of a nazirite. <b>Abaye raised an objection to his</b> opinion from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:3): In a case where <b>the thick soup</b> was made with produce that had the status <b>of <i>teruma</i> but the garlic and oil</b> therein were <b>of non-sacred</b> produce, <b>and one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>touched some of</b> the contents, <b>he</b> has <b>disqualified all</b> the contents of the pot from being eaten, as it all is considered <i>teruma</i> soup. However, if <b>the thick soup</b> was made with <b>produce of non-sacred</b> status <b>but the garlic and the oil</b> had the status <b>of <i>teruma</i></b> produce, <b>and one who immersed himself that day touched some of them, he</b> has <b>disqualified only</b> the contents in the <b>place that he touched.</b> |
| Tevul Yom 2:7 | tanna’im , | Avodah Zarah60a:2 | <b>Rav Yeimar says:</b> Rav Pappa’s ruling is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as the mishna teaches (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:7): In the case of <b>a barrel that was pierced, whether on its top, on its bottom, or on</b> one of <b>its sides,</b> if <b>one who immersed that day touched it,</b> it is <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it was pierced <b>on its top or on its bottom,</b> it is <b>impure.</b> If it was pierced <b>on</b> one of <b>its sides,</b> the wine is <b>pure,</b> whether it was touched <b>from here or from there,</b> i.e., on either side. Only the wine that he touched is rendered impure. According to the first version of Rav Pappa’s statement he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. |
| Tevul Yom 3:1 | raise a contradiction | Chullin 127b:21 | One can <b>raise a contradiction</b> to this statement from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 3:1): With regard to a piece of <b>food that was sliced</b> from a larger piece of food <b>and</b> remains <b>partially connected</b> to the larger piece, the entire item is considered one and the same with regard to impurity. If one who was previously ritually impure and immersed that day and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed touched either piece of the item, the entire item becomes impure. |
