| ii Samuel 23:5 | said to him: Isn’t it written as follows: “Ordered in all things and secure” | Eruvin 54a:1 | <b>She kicked him</b> and <b>said to him: Isn’t it written as follows: “Ordered in all things and secure”</b> (ii Samuel 23:5), which indicates that <b>if</b> the Torah <b>is ordered in your 248 limbs,</b> i.e., if you exert your entire body in studying it, <b>it will be secure, and if not, it will not be secure.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>it was</b> similarly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer had a student who would study quietly,</b> and <b>after three years he forgot his studies.</b> |
