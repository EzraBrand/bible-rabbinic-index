| Sukka 3:1 | raised an objection to | Sukkah 43b:12 | Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Yosef from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 3:1): The mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i> overrides Shabbat at</b> the <b>start</b> of the Festival, <b>and the willow branch</b> overrides it <b>at</b> the <b>end</b> of the Festival. <b>One time, the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> the <b>willow branch occurred on Shabbat, and they brought branches of</b> the <b>willow</b> tree <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> before Shabbat, <b>and placed them in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> for use on Shabbat. The <b>Boethusians</b> in the Temple, who disagreed with the Sages and held that there is no mitzva of the willow branch on the seventh day of the Festival, <b>noticed them and took them and concealed them under</b> the <b>stones.</b> This was an attempt to prevent fulfillment of the mitzva, as they knew that the Sages would prohibit moving the stones, which are set-aside on Shabbat. |
| Sukka 3:11 | from that which is taught | Bekhorot 31b:14 | The Gemara states: One can conclude <b>by inference</b> from this <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> in the case of an animal tithe offering of <b>an adult,</b> i.e., a non-orphan, its meat may <b>not</b> be sold even <b>by</b> means of <b>inclusion. What is different</b> in this case <b>from that which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 3:11): In the case of <b>one who purchases a <i>lulav</i> from another,</b> who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, the seller <b>gives him an <i>etrog</i></b> together with the <i>lulav</i> <b>as a gift, as it is not permitted for one to purchase</b> the <i>etrog</i> <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, and one may not give the value of Sabbatical-Year produce to an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, lest he engage in commerce with it, which is prohibited. |
