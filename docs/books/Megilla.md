| Megilla 3:1 | raises an objection | Megillah 29b:16 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:1): When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read the</b> Torah <b>portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest</b> (II Kings 12:1–17). <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>Shekalim</i> is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is</b> the reason <b>that they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest: Because it is comparable</b> in content <b>to</b> the Torah reading, <b>as it is written</b> in the story of Jehoiada: <b>“The money of his assessment of persons”</b> (II Kings 12:5), which is referring to his collection of the half-shekels, and the <i>haftara</i> should always contain a theme similar to the Torah reading. |
| Megilla 3:11 | The Sages taught | Megillah 23a:11 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:11): <b>All</b> people <b>count toward the quorum of seven</b> readers, <b>even a minor and even a woman. However, the Sages said</b> that <b>a woman should not read the Torah, out of respect for the congregation.</b> |
| Megilla 3:12 | hear | Megillah 27a:10 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:12): <b>A Torah scroll may be placed upon</b> another <b>Torah</b> scroll, <b>and a Torah</b> scroll may be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah, <b>and</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah may be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>the Prophets or Writings. However,</b> scrolls of <b>the Prophets or Writings may not</b> be placed <b>upon</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah, <b>and</b> scrolls of <b>one of the five</b> books of the Torah <b>may not be placed upon a Torah</b> scroll. From the first clause, it is apparent that one Torah scroll may be used for the sake of another. By extension, it should be permitted to sell one Torah scroll to purchase another. |
| Megilla 5:2 | taught | Taanit 14b:9 | § The mishna taught: <b>If these</b> fasts have passed <b>and they have not been answered, they decrease</b> their engagement <b>in</b> business <b>negotiations</b> and <b>in building and planting.</b> It was <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 5:2): <b>Building</b> means <b>joyful building,</b> not building in general. Likewise, <b>planting</b> means <b>joyful planting,</b> not all planting. The <i>Tosefta</i> elaborates: <b>What is joyful building? This</b> is referring to <b>one who builds a wedding chamber for his son.</b> It was customary upon the marriage of a son to build him a small house where the marriage feast was held and where the newlywed couple would live for a certain period of time. <b>What is joyful planting? This</b> is referring to <b>one who</b> plants <b>a splendid, royal garden</b> that does not serve practical purposes, but is only for ornamentation. |
