| Demai 1:2 | hear | Bava Metzia54a:5 | <b>Ravina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 1:2): For second tithe of <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> whose status is that of untithed produce by rabbinic law, <b>there is no</b> payment of <b>one-fifth</b> if the owner redeems its second tithe, <b>and there is no</b> obligation of the <b>eradication</b> of tithes after three years, as is the case with tithes taken from untithed produce. |
| Demai 1:2 | Rav Sheshet raises an objection | Bava Metzia55b:7 | <b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> to this principle from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 1:2), which teaches: <b>One may desacralize silver</b> coins of second tithe of <i>demai</i> <b>upon</b> other <b>silver</b> coins, and <b>copper</b> coins <b>upon copper</b> coins, and <b>silver</b> coins <b>upon copper</b> coins, <b>and copper</b> coins <b>upon produce, and he may then redeem</b> that <b>produce</b> with money; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: That produce</b> that redeemed the copper coins <b>must be taken up and eaten in Jerusalem.</b> It may not be redeemed again. |
| Demai 1:3 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 7b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>And is one</b> who purchases grain that is <i>demai</i> in order to feed his animal <b>obligated</b> to tithe it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 1:3): <b>One who purchases</b> grain in the market <b>for sowing or for</b> feeding <b>an animal, or flour to</b> process animal <b>hides, or oil to</b> kindle <b>a lamp, or oil to smear on vessels is exempt from the</b> obligation of tithing <b><i>demai</i>?</b> |
| Demai 3:4 | elsewhere | Bekhorot 11b:4 | § The Gemara cites an additional discussion involving this issue: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Demai</i> 3:4) that with regard to <b>one who deposits his produce with a Samaritan or with one who is unreliable with regard to tithes [<i>am ha’aretz</i>],</b> when they return it to him, the produce retains <b>its presumptive status with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>tithe and</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, both of which must be removed from one’s property. The Samaritan or <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not suspected of having exchanged the deposited produce with untithed produce or produce of the Sabbatical Year. |
| Demai 3:4 | raises a contradiction | Gittin 61b:7 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what is taught in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:4): With regard to <b>one who takes</b> tithed <b>wheat to a Samaritan grinder or to a grinder who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> the wheat retains <b>its presumptive status with regard to tithes and Sabbatical-</b>Year produce, as there is no concern that the grinder switched the grain. <b>But</b> the wheat does <b>not</b> retain its presumptive status <b>with regard to impurity,</b> as there is concern that perhaps the grinder touched it and rendered it impure. |
| Demai 3:5 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 6b:1 | The Gemara asks: <b>And in general,</b> in a case not involving one’s mother-in-law, <b>are we not concerned</b> about the possibility of replacement? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:5): <b>One who gives</b> dough or a pot of food <b>to his innkeeper [<i>pundakit</i>]</b> who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i> to bake or cook, <b>tithes what he gives her and</b> tithes <b>what he takes</b> back <b>from her, due to</b> the fact <b>that she is suspected</b> of <b>replacing</b> the ingredients? The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> her intentions are good, as the innkeeper <b>rationalizes</b> her deception <b>and says:</b> Let the <b>student</b> of Torah <b>eat</b> my <b>hot</b> food <b>and I will eat</b> his <b>cold</b> food. |
| Demai 3:5 | But didn’t we learn | Gittin 61b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this to say that in the case of <b>ordinary</b> people <b>we are not concerned</b> that food will be exchanged in a similar situation? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:5): If <b>one gives</b> food <b>to an innkeeper [<i>pundakit</i>]</b> so that she can prepare it for him, <b>he must tithe</b> everything <b>that he gives her and</b> everything <b>that he takes from her, because she exchanges</b> the food received from him with food of her own? This indicates that the concern is not limited to the case of a mother-in-law. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the innkeeper <b>rules</b> for herself that it is permitted for her to do this <b>and says:</b> Why <b>should</b> this <b>student</b> of Torah <b>eat hot</b> food <b>while I will eat cold</b> food? In other words, the innkeeper may justify her behavior to herself and exchange his food for hers. |
| Demai 3:6 | But didn’t we learn | Chullin 6a:19 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are we not concerned about replacement</b> of the ingredients that he gave his neighbor with her own? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:6): <b>One who gives</b> dough <b>to his mother-in-law,</b> who is suspect with regard to tithing, so that she will prepare it for him, must <b>tithe</b> everything <b>that he gives her and</b> everything <b>that he takes</b> back <b>from her.</b> This is <b>because she is suspected</b> of <b>replacing</b> an ingredient <b>that spoils.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There, the reason</b> is <b>like it is taught</b> explicitly in that mishna, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The mother-in-law <b>desires her daughter’s well-being</b> and wants to ensure that she eats quality food, <b>and is reticent</b> to tell <b>her son-in-law</b> that she replaced the ingredients that spoiled. |
| Demai 3:6 | raises a contradiction | Gittin 61b:10 | <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from what was taught in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:6): With regard to <b>one who gives</b> food <b>to his mother-in-law,</b> who is the wife of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, so that she may prepare it for him, <b>he must tithe</b> everything <b>that he gives her and</b> everything <b>that he takes from her.</b> This is <b>because she is suspected of exchanging</b> any food received from him <b>that was spoiled</b> with her own food that was not spoiled. Perhaps, then, she did not return the food that he had given her but rather food that was not yet tithed. In this mishna, there is concern that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> may exchange produce that he received with produce of his own. |
| Demai 4:1 | as we learned | Chullin 75b:17 | The case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i></b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:1): With regard to <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe that was separated from the produce of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, who is suspected of not separating tithes properly, <b>that</b> fell and <b>returned to its</b> original <b>place,</b> becoming mingled with the rest of produce from which it had been separated, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shezuri says: Even on a weekday one may ask</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> whether or not he separated the necessary tithes <b>and</b> then <b>eat based on his statement.</b> |
| Demai 4:3 | the Rabbis, as we learned | Nedarim 84a:5 | <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the matter is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> that says that the woman may derive benefit even from poor man’s tithe reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> mishna, which does not mention poor man’s tithe, reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:3): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person need not</b> actually set aside, nor even <b>designate by name, the poor man’s tithe of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> i.e., produce purchased from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, one who is not diligent in separating tithes, as poor man’s tithe has no sanctity, and a poor man cannot claim it from him, since he cannot offer proof that this produce in fact has the status of poor man’s tithe. |
| Demai 4:5 | Rav Sheizevi raises an objection | Bekhorot 36a:20 | <b>Rav Sheizevi raises an objection</b> to Rav’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:5): In the case of <b>one who says to someone who is not trusted with regard to tithe: Purchase</b> produce <b>for me from someone who is trusted</b> with regard to tithes, i.e., one who does not purchase produce from an ignoramus, who generally does not separate tithes; <b>or</b> if he says: Purchase produce for me <b>from someone who tithes,</b> i.e., even from one who purchases produce from an ignoramus but is careful to set aside tithes upon purchasing the produce, the agent <b>is not deemed credible</b> to claim that he fulfilled the condition of the one who appointed him. According to Rav, <b>why</b> isn’t the agent deemed credible? <b>Say</b> the principle that with regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it.</b> |
| Demai 4:7 | as we learned | Ketubot 56b:4 | This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:7): In the case of <b>donkey drivers who entered a city</b> to sell their wares, <b>and one of them said: My</b> produce <b>is</b> from the <b>new</b> crop and is still moist and not as good, <b>but my associate’s</b> produce <b>is</b> from the <b>old</b> crop, or he said: <b>Mine is not fit</b> for use, i.e., tithes have not been separated, <b>but my associate’s</b> produce <b>is fit</b> for use, the drivers <b>are not afforded credibility.</b> There is a suspicion that they may be lying. They may have an arrangement between them where one will make this statement in one city and in the next city they will alternate, in order to appear credible, so that one will always be able to sell his wares. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They are deemed credible.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda holds that a verbal stipulation is sufficient even for a common monetary matter of rabbinic law. |
| Demai 5:3 | Ravina raises an objection | Bava Metzia56a:4 | <b>Ravina raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:3): <b>One who purchases</b> bread <b>from a baker</b> who is unreliable with regard to tithes [<i>am ha’aretz</i>] <b>may tithe from warm</b> bread <b>for,</b> i.e., to exempt, <b>cold</b> bread, <b>and from cold</b> bread <b>for warm</b> bread, <b>and</b> one may do so <b>even</b> if the bread is in different shapes <b>from many molds;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
| Demai 5:4 | merchant [ mipalter ], as we learned | Bava Metzia56a:9 | <b>But</b> as for <b>Ravina,</b> the question arises: <b>Rather than raising an objection from</b> this case of <b>a baker,</b> from which proof is cited that Rabbi Meir does not draw a parallel between rabbinic law and Torah law, <b>let him</b> cite <b>support for</b> the assessment of the opinion of Rabbi Meir <b>from</b> the case of a bread <b>merchant [<i>mipalter</i>], as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:4): <b>One who purchases</b> bread <b>from a merchant tithes</b> separately <b>from</b> the bread of <b>each and every mold;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> In this case, Rabbi Meir is stringent with regard to <i>demai</i>. |
| Demai 5:10 | and he should separate teruma again. Didn’t we learn | Kiddushin 46b:11 | The Gemara makes a suggestion based on a comparison to a similar case: <b>But let it be <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>and he should separate <i>teruma</i> again. Didn’t we learn</b> a similar idea in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separated <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot <b>for</b> the produce of <b>a perforated</b> pot, it is <b><i>teruma</i></b> by rabbinic law, <b>but he must separate <i>teruma</i> again</b> to render the produce grown in the perforated pot ready to eat. The Gemara answers: <b>We have</b> already <b>established</b> that with regard to things that are <b>in two</b> separate <b>containers,</b> one <b>will listen,</b> but with regard to something that is <b>in one container, one will not listen.</b> |
| Demai 5:10 | Didn’t we learn | Kiddushin 46b:7 | The Gemara asks a question based on a comparison to a similar case: <b>But</b> why must the priest go to the effort of returning the flour to its owner? <b>Let</b> the separated flour <b>be</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, by rabbinic law, <b>and it should not be eaten</b> by the priest <b>until he removes <i>ḥalla</i> for it from somewhere else,</b> in order to make it ready to be eaten. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separated <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce grown in <b>a perforated</b> pot, which is obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes by Torah law, <b>for</b> produce that had grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot, which is not obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes according to Torah law; although the separating of <i>teruma</i> did not take effect, and the putative <i>teruma</i> is still untithed produce, it is considered to be <b><i>teruma</i></b> and remains in the possession of the priest, <b>and it may not be eaten until he removes <i>teruma</i> and tithes for it from somewhere else.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply in the case of the <i>ḥalla</i>. |
| Demai 5:10 | learn | Menachot 70a:15 | Is he teaching <b>that</b> planting in a non-perforated flowerpot <b>is</b> considered <b>sowing by rabbinic law? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one <b>separated <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot <b>for</b> produce of <b>a perforated</b> pot, it is <b><i>teruma</i></b> by rabbinic law, <b>and he must again separate <i>teruma</i></b> from the produce obligated in <i>teruma</i> by Torah law to render the produce grown in the perforated pot permitted in consumption. Since this separation has the status of <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law, evidently sowing in a non-perforated pot is considered sowing. |
| Demai 5:10 | he has done nothing. There, we learned | Yevamot 89a:11 | <b>And</b> the Gemara also <b>raises a contradiction</b> between one case involving <b>an intentional</b> sinner and another case <b>of an intentional</b> sinner. <b>Here, it</b> is <b>taught</b> that in the case of <b>an intentional</b> sinner who separates <i>teruma</i>, <b>he has done nothing. There, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10), that with regard to <b>one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce growing in a vessel <b>that is not perforated, for</b> produce that grew in <b>a perforated</b> vessel, which is considered connected to the ground, it is <b><i>teruma</i>, but he must go back and separate</b> <i>teruma</i> a second time. This ruling is based on the principle that anything that grew in a pot without a hole does not require separation of <i>teruma</i> by Torah law. In this case, the fact that he must again set aside <i>teruma</i> does not mean that the portion he separated is not consecrated at all. |
| Demai 5:10 | different from that which we learned | Yevamot 89b:1 | in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separates <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> that which grew in <b>a perforated</b> pot <b>for that which is</b> from <b>a non-perforated</b> pot, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>, but it may not be eaten until he removes</b> on behalf <b>of</b> that portion itself <b><i>teruma</i> and tithe from another place?</b> In other words, the portion he separated as <i>teruma</i> is not entirely consecrated, as it too is considered untithed produce in the sense that <i>teruma</i> must be separated for it. In contrast, one who sets aside impure <i>teruma</i> does not have to separate <i>teruma</i> from that portion itself. |
| Demai 6:2 | there | Bava Metzia101a:8 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Demai</i> 6:2): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>one who receives a field of his ancestors from a gentile</b> under a sharecropping agreement, i.e., he is granted the right to cultivate the land and keep its produce in return for giving a portion of the produce to the gentile owner, must first <b>tithe</b> the produce grown in that field <b>and</b> only then <b>give</b> the gentile his portion from among the tithed produce. |
| Demai 6:9 | He said to him: You learned it | Chagigah 25a:12 | § It was taught in the mishna: Once <b>the</b> periods of the <b>winepress and olive press have passed,</b> if <i>amei ha’aretz</i> <b>brought to</b> a <i>ḥaver</i> priest a <b>barrel of <i>teruma</i> wine, he may not accept it from them. But</b> the giver <b>may leave it</b> over <b>for the following winepress</b> season, in the following year. <b>They raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> If the priest <b>violated</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>and did accept</b> the wine from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permissible <b>that he should leave it</b> over for himself <b>for the following winepress</b> season? Since it is permissible to accept the wine and oil of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> intentionally left until that time, perhaps it is also permissible if the priest himself intentionally leaves it over until that time. <b>He said to him: You learned it</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 6:9): |
| Demai 6:10 | forbidden? But didn’t we learn | Avodah Zarah64a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>And if he desires its preservation in a case like this, is</b> the money <b>forbidden? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 6:10): In the case of <b>a convert and a gentile who inherited from their gentile father,</b> the <b>convert can say to</b> his gentile brother: <b>You take</b> the objects of <b>idol worship and I</b> will take the <b>money,</b> or: <b>You take the wine</b> used for <b>a libation and I</b> will take the <b>produce;</b> but <b>if</b> they make this exchange <b>after</b> the property <b>came into the possession of the convert,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> |
| Demai 6:10 | As we learned | Kiddushin 17b:15 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 6:10): With regard to <b>a convert and a gentile who inherited</b> property <b>from their gentile father, the convert can say to the gentile: You take</b> the objects of <b>idol worship and I</b> will take <b>money; you take wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry <b>and I</b> will take <b>produce.</b> Provided that these objects have not entered the domain of the convert, he may divide everything with his brother so that his brother takes as an inheritance the items that the convert is prohibited from using as a Jew. But <b>once they have come into the convert’s possession,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to exchange these objects with his brother, as he would thereby be benefiting from idolatry. |
| Demai 7:4 | designation, as we learned | Bava Kamma69a:17 | The Gemara <b>says: There is no alternative, as</b> one <b>cannot</b> do otherwise than <b>to reverse the <i>baraita</i>, as</b> that would mean <b>that in this <i>baraita</i> it teaches that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that there is a principle of retroactive <b>designation. And we have heard</b> elsewhere <b>that Rabbi Yehuda generally does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 7:4): |
| Demai 7:4 | As we learned | Meilah 22a:1 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> yet another version of Reish Lakish’s question. <b>He raised a contradiction between</b> the mishna here involving <b>purses</b> and another mishna referring <b>to a <i>log</i></b> measure. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 7:4): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>]</b> and there is reason to suspect that <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not separated, and he cannot separate them before the start of Shabbat, what should he do? |
| Demai 7:6 | he is flogged, as we learned | Temurah 4a:5 | The Gemara suggests: <b>On the contrary, it may be concluded that it is Rabbi Elazar who said</b> that <b>he is flogged, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 7:6): <b>If two baskets of untithed produce were before</b> someone, <b>and he said:</b> The <b>tithe of this</b> basket <b>is in that</b> basket, then the produce of <b>the first</b> basket is thereby <b>tithed.</b> And when he separates sufficient tithe from the second basket to exempt both baskets, the produce of the second basket will be considered tithed as well. |
| Demai 8:7 | clarification, as it is taught | Gittin 25a:15 | The Gemara elaborates: When one <b>makes it dependent on his own decision,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans,</b> about whom it is assumed that they did not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, and he is not in a position to now separate <i>teruma</i>, he acts as follows: If there are, for example, one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, he <b>says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and one-tenth of the remainder, which is approximately <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe.</b> |
| Demai 8:7 | as | Gittin 26a:3 | Rava explains: <b>And there,</b> in the mishna about one who purchases wine from Samaritans, they do not prohibit him from relying on the separation that he will later perform because they do not accept the principle of retroactive clarification. Rather, the <b>reason</b> they do not prohibit him from relying on the separation that he will later perform is <b>as</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Demai</i> 8:7) <b>teaches:</b> The Sages <b>said to Rabbi Meir: Don’t you concede</b> that <b>perhaps the wineskin will burst</b> before he manages to separate the <i>teruma</i>, <b>and this</b> person <b>will have been found retroactively</b> to be <b>drinking untithed produce?</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: When it</b> actually <b>bursts,</b> there will be a concern. In any event, from the question that they addressed to Rabbi Meir, it is clear that they would accept the principle of retroactive clarification in this case. |
| Demai 8:7 | As we learned | Gittin 28a:16 | <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans,</b> about whom it is assumed that they did not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, and he is not in a position to separate <i>teruma</i>, he acts as follows: If there are, for example, one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, <b>he says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and one-tenth of the remainder, which is approximately <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later, which will clarify retroactively what he designated for the tithes and for <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> |
