| Oholot 1:6 | there | Chullin 21a:10 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6) with regard to creeping animals whose carcasses are ritually impure: <b>If their heads were removed, even if they are convulsing, they are impure like the tail of a lizard</b> that was severed <b>that convulses</b> even though it is not alive. |
| Oholot 1:6 | raises an objection | Nazir 43a:11 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6): <b>A person renders</b> others <b>impure only when his soul departs</b> from <b>him, even if he has severe lacerations [<i>meguyyad</i>], and even if</b> he <b>is dying. But according to the one who says</b> that the commencement of the impurity of a corpse is derived <b>from “to profane himself,”</b> this <i>baraita</i> is difficult, as it <b>teaches</b> that a dying person <b>does not impart impurity.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to imparting impurity,</b> he does not impart impurity <b>until his soul departs, but with regard to profaning</b> the sanctity of the priesthood, a priest <b>is profaned</b> by a dying person. |
| Oholot 1:6 | raises a contradiction | Yevamot 120b:6 | § We learned in the mishna: <b>And even if one saw him cut open [<i>meguyyad</i>]</b> and severely wounded, one may not testify that he died. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> a person who is <b>cut open is</b> fit <b>to live</b> for much time afterward? The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what was taught in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6): A dead <b>person renders</b> other people and objects <b>impure only when his soul</b> actually <b>departs, even if he is cut open</b> and severely wounded, <b>and even if he is</b> clearly <b>dying.</b> From this we may deduce that <b>he does not</b> yet <b>render</b> others <b>ritually impure,</b> as he still has some life in him, <b>but he is not</b> fit <b>to live</b> for much time afterward. |
| Oholot 1:7 | raises an objection | Meilah 16b:6 | The Gemara stated: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan praised</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina for citing the <i>baraita</i> that rules that one is liable for violating the prohibition of eating a creeping animal by the amount of a lentil-bulk. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:7): <b>The</b> whole <b>limbs</b> of impure bodies <b>have no</b> minimum <b>measure</b> with regard to imparting ritual impurity. <b>Even</b> if the limbs were <b>less than an olive-bulk of a carcass or less than a lentil-bulk of a creeping animal,</b> they <b>impart</b> ritual <b>impurity. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This mishna is referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity; but with regard to the minimum measure which renders one liable for consumption, <b>one is flogged for</b> eating <b>them only</b> if they amount to <b>an olive-bulk.</b> |
| Oholot 1:7 | a creeping animal not impart impurity in any amount? But didn’t we learn | Niddah 43b:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal not impart impurity in any amount? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:7): <b>The limbs</b> of impure bodies that are whole <b>have no</b> minimum <b>measure</b> with regard to imparting ritual impurity. Even if a limb is <b>less than an olive-bulk of</b> a human <b>corpse, or less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or less than a lentil-bulk of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> it imparts ritual impurity. If so, how can the <i>baraita</i> state that there is a minimum measure of a lentil-bulk with regard to the impurity of a creeping animal? |
| Oholot 2:1 | there | Bekhorot 45a:15 | § With regard to impurity imparted by extra appendages, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 2:1): <b>A majority of the</b> skeletal <b>structure or a majority of the number</b> of bones in the corpse of a <b>dead</b> person, <b>even when there is not a quarter</b> of a <i>kav</i> of bones among them, <b>are impure.</b> Concerning the ruling of this mishna, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered <b>a majority of the</b> skeletal <b>structure</b> of a corpse? It is <b>two calves and one thigh, since</b> this constitutes <b>a majority of the height of an adult. What is</b> considered <b>a majority of the number</b> of bones? <b>One hundred and twenty-five</b> bones. |
| Oholot 2:1 | so that an olive-bulk of a corpse does not impart ritual impurity by means of a tent? But didn’t we learn | Moed Katan5b:4 | The Gemara begins to analyze this <i>baraita</i> by asking: <b>Is it</b> really <b>so that an olive-bulk of a corpse does not impart ritual impurity by means of a tent? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:1): <b>These are</b> the items <b>that impart ritual impurity by means of a tent,</b> and among other items this list includes <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse?</b> |
| Oholot 2:2 | We learned | Nazir 50b:6 | § The mishna taught: <b>And for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a full ladle of dust.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>And how much is</b> this <b>measure</b> of a full ladle of dust? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: A full palm of the hand. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: His handfuls,</b> i.e., the amount that can be held in the whole hand, including the fingers. The Gemara cites a relevant source. <b>We learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): <b>The full ladle of dust that</b> the Sages <b>spoke of includes</b> all that can be contained <b>from the base</b> of the <b>fingers and above;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: His handfuls.</b> |
| Oholot 2:2 | another | Niddah 27b:8 | There is a different dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis that <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): If a house contains <b>a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery and</b> slightly <b>more,</b> the house <b>is impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: They deem the house impure <b>as it is impossible for</b> slightly <b>more than a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery not to contain a ladleful of dust</b> from a corpse. |
| Oholot 2:2 | Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned | Niddah 28a:3 | <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that a deformed corpse imparts impurity to items that are under the same roof? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>the ashes of burned</b> corpses that are not mixed with other types of ashes or dirt, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its measure for</b> imparting impurity to items that are under the same roof is a <b>quarter</b> of a <i>kav</i>. Clearly, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a deformed corpse imparts impurity to items that are under the same roof. |
| Oholot 2:3 | As we learned | Bekhorot 37b:17 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3): <b>The spine and the skull</b> of a corpse <b>that</b> are <b>incomplete</b> do not impart ritual impurity in a tent. This <i>halakha</i> was unanimously accepted, but the details were subject to dispute: <b>How much</b> is considered <b>a deficiency in the spine so that it will not impart impurity in a tent? Beit Shammai say:</b> If it is missing <b>two vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say:</b> Even if it is missing only <b>one vertebra,</b> it will not impart impurity. <b>And</b> likewise, they disagree concerning the deficiency <b>in the skull: Beit Shammai say</b> that it must be missing a piece <b>like the size of a drilled hole, and Beit Hillel say:</b> It must be missing <b>an amount that if removed from a living</b> person, <b>he would die.</b> |
| Oholot 2:3 | As we learned | Bekhorot 38a:18 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3): <b>With regard to which drill did</b> Beit Shammai <b>state</b> their opinion concerning an incomplete skull? It was <b>with regard to a small</b> drill <b>of doctors,</b> used for drilling bones. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> It was <b>with regard to a large</b> drill, such as that used <b>in the</b> Temple <b>chamber.</b> According to the mishna concerning a window that imparts impurity, the size of this drill is like that of a <i>sela</i> coin, and the opinions of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel would still be identical. |
| Oholot 2:3 | a deficiency in the spine? As we learned | Chullin 42b:3 | The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a deficiency in the spine? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3): <b>How much</b> is considered <b>a deficiency in the spine</b> of a corpse so that it will not be considered a full corpse to impart impurity in a tent? <b>Beit Shammai say: Two</b> missing <b>vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say: One vertebra. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Just as Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to ritual impurity, <b>so too</b> they disagree <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., according to Beit Hillel an animal missing only one vertebra is a <i>tereifa</i>. This is not included in the count of Rabbi Yishmael. |
| Oholot 2:3 | Rav Yirmeya raises an objection: | Chullin 45a:3 | <b>Rav Yirmeya raises an objection:</b> The mishna teaches (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3) that if a skull of a corpse has a round hole at least the size of a drill bit used for surgery, then the skull does not impart ritual impurity in a tent. With regard to this, a <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And in a skull that contains one long hole,</b> or <b>even</b> if <b>it has many</b> small <b>holes,</b> the areas of the holes <b>join together to</b> constitute the <b>size of a drill hole. Evidently, since the</b> requisite <b>measure is</b> the <b>size of a drill hole,</b> the small holes <b>join together to</b> constitute the <b>size of a drill hole,</b> and not another measure. If so, <b>here, too,</b> in the case of the windpipe, <b>since the</b> requisite <b>measure</b> of a hole to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> is the size of <b>an <i>issar</i></b> (see 54a), the small holes should <b>join together to</b> constitute the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>.</b> Why must they constitute the majority of the circumference? |
| Oholot 2:3 | a tereifa ? But raise a contradiction | Chullin 52a:21 | The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel really say that if <b>a rib was ripped from its root,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? But raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3): |
| Oholot 2:7 | as it is taught | Nazir 52b:2 | The first explanation is: Rabbi Akiva listed the spine and skull as separate items, but the six include <b>anywhere that many</b> Sages <b>disagree with him, to the exclusion of</b> the case of a bone that is <b>a barley-grain-bulk,</b> as here <b>it is an individual who disagrees with</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:7): If <b>a bone that is a barley-grain-bulk was divided into two, Rabbi Akiva deems</b> it <b>impure and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> In this case, only one Sage disagrees with Rabbi Akiva. |
| Oholot 2:10 | as it is taught | Nazir 38a:6 | <b>And they died,</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:10): <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood that emerges from two corpses, that it renders</b> people and objects <b>ritually impure in a tent,</b> i.e., a house, meaning that one who enters that house contracts ritual impurity imparted by a corpse? <b>As it is stated,</b> with regard to the prohibition against ritual impurity for priests: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural form indicates that the blood of two people joins together to form the minimum amount of a quarter-<i>log</i> for ritual impurity in a tent. |
| Oholot 3:1 | which we learned | Chullin 124b:5 | The statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael is that which we said:</b> Two instances of contact do not join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of impurity. The statement of <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas is</b> that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): With regard to <b>any</b> part of a corpse that <b>imparts impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., that imparts impurity to any other item that is under the same roof, if that body part was <b>divided</b> into two pieces, each measuring less than an olive-bulk, but together they constitute an olive-bulk, <b>and one placed</b> both pieces <b>inside the house,Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas</b> rules that the two pieces do not join together to constitute the requisite measure of an olive-bulk. Therefore, he <b>deems</b> everything inside the house <b>pure. And the Rabbis</b> rule that the two pieces of the corpse join together to constitute an olive-bulk, and therefore they <b>deem</b> everything inside the house <b>impure.</b> |
| Oholot 3:1 | as well | Chullin 125a:17 | According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Avin said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin</b> who said: <b>We learn</b> in a mishna <b>as well</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): In the case of <b>one who touches</b> with one hand <b>half an olive-bulk</b> of a corpse <b>and</b> simultaneously his other hand <b>overlies half an olive-bulk or half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse <b>overlies him, he is impure.</b> |
| Oholot 3:1 | can they join together? But didn’t we learn | Chullin 125a:19 | <b>But if you say</b> that <b>they are two concepts,</b> how <b>can they join together? But didn’t we learn</b> in that mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): <b>This is the principle: Any</b> impure items lacking the requisite volume to have impure status on their own <b>that are of one concept join together and are impure;</b> if they are <b>of two concepts,</b> they do not join together and remain <b>pure?</b>Apparently, touching and overlying a corpse create the same type of impurity, and therefore overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna here. |
| Oholot 3:2 | And raise a contradiction | Bava Kamma101b:1 | The Gemara states that <b>Rava raises a contradiction: We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i> must be burned. Apparently,</b> the change in <b>appearance</b> precipitated by the <i>orla</i> peels <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye retains its status as <i>orla</i>. <b>And raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. <b>And some say</b> that any vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was <b>in reference to vessels that were</b> in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood was absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was <b>in reference to vessels that came</b> into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed. |
| Oholot 3:2 | Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish | Niddah 62b:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. The Gemara parenthetically notes: <b>And some say</b> that the mishna states that every vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> were in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood became absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> came into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed. |
| Oholot 3:2 | Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan | Niddah 62b:13 | <b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): <b>Any</b> liquid <b>that is absorbed</b> but <b>that is unable to emerge is pure.</b> Reish Lakish infers from this mishna that if <b>it is able to emerge it is impure, and</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it has not</b> yet <b>emerged.</b> |
| Oholot 3:3 | there | Nazir 51a:6 | The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to dust of a corpse. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one <b>cut the hair</b> of a corpse <b>and buried</b> the hair <b>with it,</b> the hair <b>becomes</b> part of the <b>mixture for</b> the dust, and it does not impart impurity. In relation to the above, the Gemara states: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 3:3): <b>Everything that is in a corpse</b> is <b>impure, except for the teeth, the hair, and the nails,</b> which do not impart impurity as part of the body. <b>But when they are attached</b> to the corpse, <b>they are all impure.</b> |
| Oholot 3:3 | raises an objection | Niddah 55a:7 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of both Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:3): <b>Everything that is in a corpse transmits impurity, except for the teeth, and the hair, and the nails.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> only when these items are separated from the body, <b>but when they are attached</b> to the corpse they are <b>all impure.</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan teeth should transmit impurity because they are similar to bones, while according to Reish Lakish they should be included in the term “from any.” |
| Oholot 3:7 | But isn’t there | Niddah 26a:17 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases where the minimum measure is one handbreadth, other than those five listed by Rabbi Oshaya? <b>But isn’t there</b> the following mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:7) that deals with the minimum size of a tent that transmits ritual impurity: <b>A cubic</b> space measuring one <b>handbreadth by</b> one <b>handbreadth with a height of</b> one <b>handbreadth transmits ritual impurity.</b> If a corpse is in that space, the impurity is transmitted to all people, vessels, and food in that space. <b>And</b> a space of that size <b>serves as a barrier before,</b> i.e., stops the spread of, <b>ritual impurity</b> beyond that space. |
| Oholot 4:2 | as we learned | Chullin 125b:14 | <b>And from where do you say</b> that this is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 4:2): In the case of <b>a compartment</b> in <b>a chest</b> that is inside a house, in which the <b>open space</b> of the compartment itself <b>has</b> at least one cubic <b>handbreadth</b> in volume, <b>but</b> the <b>opening</b> of the compartment to the house does <b>not have</b> the area of one square <b>handbreadth,</b> and the volume of the entire chest is forty <i>se’a</i>, in that case, if there is a source of <b>impurity inside</b> the compartment, the compartment does not act as a barrier and <b>the house is impure.</b> If the source of <b>impurity is inside the house</b> but outside the chest, <b>whatever is inside</b> the compartment remains <b>pure,</b> because the opening of the compartment is less than one handbreadth. |
| Oholot 4:2 | hear | Nazir 52a:6 | The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 4:2). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva deems six items impure that the Rabbis deem pure, and Rabbi Akiva</b> later <b>retracted</b> his opinion. <b>And an incident</b> occurred in <b>which they brought a box</b> that was <b>full of bones to the synagogue of blacksmiths [<i>tarsiyyim</i>], and they placed it in</b> an open <b>airspace,</b> not under the roof, so that it would not impart ritual impurity. <b>And Todos the doctor entered and all the</b> other <b>doctors</b> entered <b>with him, and they said,</b> after examining the pile: <b>There is not</b> a full <b>spine from one corpse here.</b> |
| Oholot 4:3 | hear | Nazir 50b:3 | <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 4:3): If there was <b>fat of a corpse that was whole</b> and contained an olive-bulk, <b>and one melted it,</b> it is <b>ritually impure.</b> If from the outset the fat <b>was separated</b> into pieces smaller than an olive-bulk, which do not impart impurity, <b>and one melted it,</b> so that it combined into an olive-bulk in its melted state, it is <b>pure. And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>there is no stream for food,</b> even if it was <b>whole and one melted it, it should also be pure,</b> as it became liquid and spread throughout the pan. Consequently, each part should be considered separate, which means the food is not the size of an olive-bulk. |
| Oholot 4:8 | raises an objection | Chullin 118b:21 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of both Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan from that which is taught in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 4:8): In a case of <b>two bones</b> that have <b>two halves of an olive-</b>bulk of flesh of a dead person <b>upon them,</b> i.e., half an olive-bulk of flesh is attached to one end of each bone, <b>and one placed the ends of both</b> bones that are not directly attached to the flesh <b>inside a house</b> in such a manner that <b>the house overlies those</b> ends of the bones but not the ends of the bones attached to the flesh, it is considered as though the house is overlying the flesh itself, and <b>the house is impure.</b> |
| Oholot 6:2 | raises an objection | Bava Batra19b:10 | The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 6:2): With regard to <b>a basket</b> that is <b>full of straw, or</b> an earthenware <b>barrel full of dried figs, which are placed in a window,</b> one <b>considers: If the straw or dried figs would stand on their own were</b> the basket or barrel <b>removed,</b> then <b>they would serve as a barrier against</b> the spread of impurity. <b>But if</b> they would <b>not</b> stand on their own <b>they would not serve as a barrier.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>But</b> why should the straw or dried figs serve as a barrier? Even <b>straw</b> that can stand on its own <b>is fit for</b> feeding to <b>one’s animal</b> and will likely be removed from the opening, which means it should not be considered part of the window. |
| Oholot 7:4 | elsewhere | Bekhorot 22a:5 | § The Gemara continues discussing the ritual impurity imparted by a fetus. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 7:4): If a fetus dies in its mother’s womb, it imparts ritual impurity from when the womb opens. Yet <b>deceased fetuses do not</b> impart ritual impurity in this manner even during <b>the opening of the womb, until the head</b> of the fetus is <b>round like</b> the size of <b>a skein [<i>pika</i>]</b> of yarn. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Like a skein? Rav Huna said:</b> It means <b>like a skein of woolen</b> yarn. <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said to Rav Huna: My teacher, explain</b> your statement: Were you referring to a skein <b>of warp</b> threads <b>or</b> a skein <b>of</b> the thicker <b>woof</b> threads? |
| Oholot 8:2 | GEMARA: | Nazir 54b:2 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the terms hangings and projections by citing a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 8:2). <b>And these are the hangings: A tree that overhangs the earth. And</b> the <b>projections</b> are stones <b>that protrude from a fence.</b> |
| Oholot 8:2 | as we learned | Niddah 57a:9 | The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> with regard to the following cases in which the exact location of a grave is unknown, the Samaritans <b>are not deemed credible</b> to testify: They are <b>not</b> deemed credible to testify <b>about overhanging boughs,</b> nor about the protrusions that jut out of stone fences. The Gemara explains these terms: The term <b>overhanging boughs</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 8:2): <b>These are overhanging boughs: A tree that hangs over the ground.</b> The term <b>protrusions</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 9:4): <b>Protruding stones that jut out of a fence.</b> |
| Oholot 9:4 | as we learned | Niddah 57a:9 | The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> with regard to the following cases in which the exact location of a grave is unknown, the Samaritans <b>are not deemed credible</b> to testify: They are <b>not</b> deemed credible to testify <b>about overhanging boughs,</b> nor about the protrusions that jut out of stone fences. The Gemara explains these terms: The term <b>overhanging boughs</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 8:2): <b>These are overhanging boughs: A tree that hangs over the ground.</b> The term <b>protrusions</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 9:4): <b>Protruding stones that jut out of a fence.</b> |
| Oholot 11:7 | As we learned | Chullin 126a:4 | <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 11:7): In the case of <b>a dog that ate the flesh of a corpse, and the dog</b> then <b>died and is lying on the threshold</b> in such a manner that its neck and mouth are facing toward the inside of the house, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If there is an opening</b> the size of one cubic <b>handbreadth inside the neck of</b> the dog, i.e., the neck itself constitutes this measure, the dog <b>imports impurity</b> into the house because the upper portion of the dog’s body overlies the impure item inside the dog and the impurity is transmitted through the neck and mouth of the dog into the house. <b>But if</b> there is <b>not</b> such a large cavity in the neck of the dog, then there is no <i>halakha</i> of a tent, and the dog <b>does not import the impurity</b> into the house. |
| Oholot 15:8 | And furthermore, didn’t we learn | Bava Batra101a:6 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> In Rabbi Shimon’s depiction of a burial chamber, he states that two niches should be opened up, one from the right of the entrance and one from the left. The Gemara asks: <b>These two</b> niches, <b>in which</b> direction <b>does he set them? If</b> they are directed <b>toward the outside</b> of the chamber, i.e., under the floor of the courtyard, <b>won’t</b> people <b>trample</b> over <b>them</b> when they enter the courtyard, which is improper? <b>And furthermore, didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 15:8): With regard to <b>the courtyard of a catacomb, one who stands inside it</b> is <b>ritually pure</b> because it can be presumed that he did not stand over a dead body? Clearly, these niches are not to be dug underneath the courtyard. |
| Oholot 15:8 | taught | Sotah 44a:1 | <b>A corpse occupies four cubits with</b> regard to <b>impurity,</b> as the Sages decreed that one becomes impure when he stands within four cubits of a corpse. This measure protects priests and others who are forbidden to contract ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, so that they do not inadvertently become impure. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>taught</b> in another mishna as well (<i>Oholot</i> 15:8): With regard to <b>a courtyard</b> adjacent to <b>a grave, one who stands within it is ritually pure, provided that there are four cubits</b> by four cubits <b>within it.</b> A courtyard this size constitutes its own space, according to <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel say:</b> A space of <b>four handbreadths</b> by four handbreadths is enough. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Four handbreadths suffice <b>when the entrance</b> to the courtyard is <b>from above.</b> In such a case there is no concern that one will cover the grave with his body, and thereby become ritually impure, when entering the courtyard. <b>However,</b> if <b>its entrance</b> is <b>from the side, everyone agrees</b> the courtyard must be at least <b>four cubits</b> by four cubits in size. |
| Oholot 16:2 | we learned there | Ketubot 20b:2 | § Apropos recalling testimony, the Gemara adds that <b>we learned there</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 16:2): <b>Mounds of dirt that are near either to a city or a path, whether</b> these mounds <b>are new or whether</b> they are <b>old, are ritually impure</b> due to the concern that a corpse is buried there. With regard to <b>the</b> mounds <b>that are distant</b> from the city: If they are <b>new</b> they are <b>ritually pure,</b> as, were there a corpse buried there, someone would remember, and if they are <b>old</b> they are <b>impure.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>What is</b> a mound that is <b>near?</b> It is one at a distance of up to <b>fifty cubits. And what is</b> a mound that is <b>old?</b> It is one that was there for more than <b>sixty years;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A mound that is <b>near</b> is one that there is <b>no</b> mound <b>closer than it. Old</b> is referring to a mound <b>that no one remembers.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, the parameters are not quantifiable. |
| Oholot 17:1 | as we learned | Moed Katan5b:9 | The definition of a <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> is <b>as we learned</b> elsewhere in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 17:1): <b>One who plows</b> a field containing <b>a grave,</b> thereby raising concern that bones may have become strewn throughout the field, <b>renders</b> the field <b>a <i>beit haperas</i>. And how much</b> of the field <b>does he render</b> a <i>beit haperas</i>? <b>The full</b> length of <b>a furrow,</b> which is <b>a hundred cubits.</b> |
| Oholot 17:1 | one hundred cubits, as it is taught | Temurah 13a:1 | A <i>beit haperas</i> extends over <b>three fields,</b> the field that was plowed and the two adjacent fields in the direction it was plowed. For example, if one plowed the field from north to south, each of the fields adjacent to it on the north and south is also considered a <i>beit haperas</i>. <b>But</b> whereas the plowed field is a <i>beit haperas</i> in its entirety, the two adjacent fields are a <i>beit haperas</i> only to the extent of <b>two furrows,</b> one furrow on each side. <b>And how much</b> is the <b>full</b> length of <b>a furrow [<i>ma’ana</i>]?</b> It is <b>one hundred cubits, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 17:1): <b>One who plows</b> a field containing <b>a grave,</b> and who may have strewn the bones throughout the field, <b>renders</b> the field <b>a <i>beit haperas</i></b> up to <b>the full</b> length of <b>a furrow,</b> which is <b>one hundred cubits.</b> |
| Oholot 17:2 | Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned | Temurah 12b:12 | § The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> one <b><i>beit haperas</i> does not create</b> another <b><i>beit haperas</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 17:2) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b><i>beit haperas</i> creates</b> another <b><i>beit haperas</i>.</b> If one plowed from a <i>beit haperas</i> into another field, that field is also ritually impure. |
| Oholot 18:4 | elsewhere | Chagigah 25b:6 | § It was taught in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the giver <b>says</b> to the priest: <b>I separated</b> and placed <b>into</b> this barrel of <i>teruma</i> <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of sacrificial</b> wine or oil, <b>he is deemed credible.</b> The Gemara proceeds to cite a mishna in tractate <i>Oholot</i>, the discussion of which ultimately relates to this mishna here: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 18:4): <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may examine</b> the ground <b>for those performing the paschal</b> offering, <b>but one may not examine</b> the ground <b>for those who eat <i>teruma</i>.</b> |
| Oholot 18:5 | And it is taught | Nazir 55a:5 | The Gemara adds: <b>And it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 18:5) in accordance with this explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>One who enters the land of the nations in a chest, a box, or a cabinet</b> is <b>ritually pure.</b> If he was <b>in a wagon [<i>karon</i>], boat, or raft [<i>iskareya</i>],</b> he is <b>ritually impure.</b> The difference is that the latter vessels are commonly used to convey people. |
| Oholot 18:6 | elsewhere | Bava Metzia105b:3 | <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 18:6): With regard to one <b>who walks in an area in which uncertainty exists concerning the location of a grave or corpse [<i>beit haperas</i>],</b> if he treads <b>over stones that he can move</b> as he walks, raising concerns that he might have moved a bone of a corpse and thereby rendered himself impure, or if he was in that location, <b>on</b> the back of <b>a person or</b> riding <b>on an animal that had little strength,</b> he is <b>impure,</b> as he is considered to have moved the impurity himself. |
