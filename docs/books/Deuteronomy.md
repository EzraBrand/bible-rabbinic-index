| Deuteronomy 1:1 | “And Di Zahav” | Berakhot 32a:7 | The rabbis of <b>the school of R' Yannai, </b> however, <b>say</b> proof that Moses spoke impertinently toward God on High is derived <b>from here, </b> Moses’ rebuke at the beginning of Deuteronomy: <b>“And Di Zahav”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1). This is an entry in a list of places where Moses had spoken to Israel. As there was no place encountered by that name, it is interpreted as an allusion to another matter. |
| Deuteronomy 1:1 | “And Di Zahav” | Sanhedrin 102a:14 | § Apropos the calves of Jeroboam, the Talmud discusses the Golden Calf discussed in the Torah. The verse states: <b>“And Di Zahav”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1). <b>The school of R' Yannai said: Moses said before God: God!, because of the gold and silver that You lavished upon the Jewish people</b> during the exodus from Egypt <b>until they said enough [<i>dai</i>], </b> this wealth <b>caused the Jewish people to fashion for themselves gods of gold. </b> The combination of wealth and leisure left them open to a transgression of that sort. There is <b>a parable</b> for this: <b>A lion does not maul and roar over a basket of straw</b> from which he derives no pleasure; <b>rather, </b> he mauls and roars <b>over a basket of meat, </b> as he roars only when satiated. In other words, the guilt is not exclusively theirs. |
| Deuteronomy 1:1 | “And these are the words” | Sotah 41a:18 | <b>And</b> the king <b>reads from the beginning of</b> Deuteronomy, from the verse that states: <b>“And these are the words”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1), <b>until</b> the words: <b>“Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> he then reads the sections beginning with: <b>“Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), <b>“You shall tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22–29), <b>“When you have made an end of the tithing”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12–15), <b>and the passage concerning the</b> appointment of <b>a king</b> (Deuteronomy 17:14–20), <b>and the blessings and curses</b> (Deuteronomy 28), <b>until he finishes the entire portion. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:2 | “It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the way of Mount Seir” | Menachot 65a:12 | At the time, <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai joined</b> the discussion with the Boethusians <b>and said to them: Fools! From where</b> have <b>you</b> derived this? <b>And there was no man who answered him, except for one elderly man who was prattling [<i>mefatpet</i>] at him, and he said: Moses, our teacher, was a lover of the Jewish people and he knew that <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> only <b>one day. </b> Therefore, <b>he arose and established it after Shabbat, in order that the Jewish people would enjoy themselves for two days. </b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>recited this verse</b> in response <b>to</b> that old man: <b>“It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the way of Mount Seir”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:2). |
| Deuteronomy 1:3 | written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke | Rosh Hashanah2b:9 | The Talmud answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of YHWH, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the 5th month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Numbers 33:38), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke</b> to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). <b>From the fact that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Av, </b> which is the 5th month, <b>it calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year, ” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Shevat, it</b> also <b>calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year, ” the implication is</b> that the <b>New Year</b> does <b>not</b> begin in <b>Tishrei. </b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei. |
| Deuteronomy 1:3 | written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, | Rosh Hashanah3a:11 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yoḥanan: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of <b>kings’</b> reigns <b>only from</b> the month of <b>Nisan? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, </b> in the 4th year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of YHWH” (I Kings 6:1). <b>And it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of YHWH, </b> and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the 5th month, on the first day of the month” (Numbers 33:38). <b>And it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, </b> on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). |
| Deuteronomy 1:4 | “after he had slain Sihon” | Rosh Hashanah2b:13 | The Talmud rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses delivered his oration <b>“after he had slain Sihon”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:4), <b>and when Aaron died Sihon was still alive, as it is written: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:4 | And it is written: “After he had slain Sihon, | Rosh Hashanah3a:12 | <b>And it is written: “After he had slain Sihon, </b> the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon” (Deuteronomy 1:4). <b>And it says: “And when the Canaanite, </b> the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, <b>heard”</b> (Numbers 33:40). <b>And it says: “And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, </b> and they wept for Aaron thirty days” (Numbers 20:29). <b>And it says: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, </b> on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established” (Exodus 40:17). |
| Deuteronomy 1:5 | that Moses erected in the land of Moab, as it is stated: “Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses took upon himself to expound [ be’er ] | Sotah 35b:6 | § The Talmud returns to the discussion of how the Ark was brought into Eretz Yisrael. <b>You are found saying</b> that <b>there were three sets of stones. One</b> is a set <b>that Moses erected in the land of Moab, as it is stated: “Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses took upon himself to expound [<i>be’er</i>]</b> this law, saying” (Deuteronomy 1:5). <b>And it states there</b> with regard to the mitzva to erect the stones on Mount Ebal: <b>“And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law</b> clearly elucidated [<i>ba’er</i>]” (Deuteronomy 27:8). <b>It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>be’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to Moses, and the word <b>“<i>ba’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to the mitzva to write the Torah on the stones on Mount Ebal that Moses also wrote down the Torah on stones. |
| Deuteronomy 1:7 | in the valley, as it is stated: “Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the countryside, and by the seashore” | Bava Kamma81b:6 | The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And you do not have a single tribe of Israel that did not have</b> in its portion at least some land <b>in the mountains, and</b> some <b>in the lowland, and</b> some <b>in the countryside, and</b> some <b>in the valley, as it is stated: “Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the countryside, and by the seashore”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:7). <b>And you find similarly with regard to the Canaanites and Perizzites and Amorites who</b> inhabited the land <b>before</b> the Jews, <b>as it stated</b> in the above verse: “The Amorites <b>and to all their neighbors. ” Apparently, </b> the Amorites and <b>their neighbors</b> all <b>had this</b> variety of types of land in their respective territories. |
| Deuteronomy 1:7 | “As far as the great river, the river Euphrates” | Shevuot 47b:6 | With regard to the verse: <b>“As far as the great river, the river Euphrates”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:7), <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says: </b> Although it is not the largest river, the Euphrates is called great in accordance with the adage: <b>Draw close to the</b> one <b>anointed with oil and become anointed</b> as well. Because the Euphrates is close to Eretz Yisrael, it is called great. The <b>school of R' Yishmael taught</b> a similar idea: <b>The servant of a king is like a king. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:11 | as many as you are” | Rosh Hashanah28b:10 | <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a priest who went up to the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Blessing <b>should not say: Since the Torah granted me permission to bless the Jewish people, I will add a blessing of my own, </b> which is not part of the Priestly Blessing stated in the Torah, <b>for example: </b> “May <b>YHWH God of your fathers make you</b> a thousand times <b>as many as you are”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:11)? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “You shall not add to the word</b> which I command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2). <b>But here, since</b> the priest already <b>recited</b> the Priestly <b>Blessing, the time</b> of the mitzva <b>has passed, </b> and according to Rava, after the prescribed time for performing a mitzva, one does not transgress the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, yet <b>it</b> nevertheless <b>teaches that he has transgressed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:13 | mitzva will have sons the likes of whom did not exist even in Moses’ generation. With regard to Moses’ generation, it is written: “Get you, wise men, and understanding, and well-known from each one of your tribes, | Eruvin 100b:18 | Apropos sex between husband and wife, the Talmud cites that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Any woman who demands</b> of <b>her husband that</b> he fulfill his conjugal <b>mitzva will have sons the likes of whom did not exist even in Moses’ generation. With regard to Moses’ generation, it is written: “Get you, wise men, and understanding, and well-known from each one of your tribes, </b> and I will make them head over you” (Deuteronomy 1:13), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and well-known, </b> and made them heads over you” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <b>However, </b> men possessing <b>understanding, </b> which is a more lofty quality than wisdom, Moses <b>could not find</b> any of these. |
| Deuteronomy 1:13 | will have children the likes of whom did not exist even in the generation of Moses our teacher? As it is stated: “Get you wise men, and understanding, | Nedarim 20b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: Any man whose wife demands of him</b> that he have sex with her <b>will have children the likes of whom did not exist even in the generation of Moses our teacher? As it is stated: “Get you wise men, and understanding, </b> and well known from each one of your tribes, and I will make them head over you” (Deuteronomy 1:13); <b>and it is written</b> subsequently: <b>“So I took the heads of your tribes, </b> wise men, and well known” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <b>And it does not say</b> that they were <b>understanding. </b> Evidently, even Moses could not find understanding men in his generation. |
| Deuteronomy 1:15 | written: “So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and well-known, | Eruvin 100b:18 | Apropos sex between husband and wife, the Talmud cites that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Any woman who demands</b> of <b>her husband that</b> he fulfill his conjugal <b>mitzva will have sons the likes of whom did not exist even in Moses’ generation. With regard to Moses’ generation, it is written: “Get you, wise men, and understanding, and well-known from each one of your tribes, </b> and I will make them head over you” (Deuteronomy 1:13), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and well-known, </b> and made them heads over you” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <b>However, </b> men possessing <b>understanding, </b> which is a more lofty quality than wisdom, Moses <b>could not find</b> any of these. |
| Deuteronomy 1:15 | “So I took the heads of your tribes, | Nedarim 20b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: Any man whose wife demands of him</b> that he have sex with her <b>will have children the likes of whom did not exist even in the generation of Moses our teacher? As it is stated: “Get you wise men, and understanding, </b> and well known from each one of your tribes, and I will make them head over you” (Deuteronomy 1:13); <b>and it is written</b> subsequently: <b>“So I took the heads of your tribes, </b> wise men, and well known” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <b>And it does not say</b> that they were <b>understanding. </b> Evidently, even Moses could not find understanding men in his generation. |
| Deuteronomy 1:16 | “And I charged your judges at that time, | Sanhedrin 7b:14 | The Talmud interprets other verses related to the topic of adjudicating cases. <b>“And I charged your judges at that time, </b> saying: Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger who is with him” (Deuteronomy 1:16). Understanding that the word “charged” indicates alacrity, <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> Moses urged the judges: <b>With regard to the rod and the strap, be vigilant. </b> With regard to the clause <b>“Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge, ” R' Ḥanina says: </b> This is <b>a warning to a court that</b> it <b>may not hear the statement of</b> one <b>litigant before the other litigant comes, and</b> it is <b>a warning to a litigant that</b> he <b>may not explain his statement to the judge before the other litigant comes. Read into</b> the phrase in the verse: <b>“Hear the causes between your brethren, ”</b> that it is <b>also concerning</b> the litigant. Although he is not the judge, he is also required to assure that the case is conducted in the presence of both parties. |
| Deuteronomy 1:16 | It is written: “And I charged your judges at that time” | Sanhedrin 8a:6 | The Talmud continues to interpret verses pertaining to judges and judgment. <b>It is written: “And I charged your judges at that time”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:16), <b>and it is written</b> soon thereafter: <b>“And I commanded you at that time</b> all the things that you should do” (Deuteronomy 1:18). There is an apparent contradiction between these verses, as one indicates God commanded the judges and the other indicates He commanded the people. <b>R' Elazar says</b> that <b>R' Simlai says: </b> Moses issued <b>a warning to the community that the awe of the judge must be upon them, and</b> Moses issued <b>a warning to the judge that</b> he must <b>bear</b> the burden of <b>the community. Up to what</b> degree must the judge bear this burden? <b>R' Ḥanan, and some say R' Shabbtai, says: </b> It is as Moses said, that he carried Israel <b>“as a nursing father carries the sucking child”</b> (Numbers 11:12). |
| Deuteronomy 1:16 | “And judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the convert with him” | Yevamot 47a:7 | <b>A baraita states: </b> The verse states that Moses charged the judges of a court: <b>“And judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the convert with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:16). <b>From here, </b> based on the mention of a convert in the context of judgment in a court, <b>R' Yehuda said: </b> A potential <b>convert who converts in a court is a</b> valid <b>convert. </b> However, if he converts <b>in private, he is not a convert. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | you, as it is stated: “You shall not be afraid before any man” | Sanhedrin 6b:12 | <b>And Reish Lakish says: </b> If <b>two</b> litigants <b>come for a judgment, </b> and <b>one</b> is <b>flexible</b> and agreeable <b>and one</b> is <b>rigid</b> and contentious, <b>before you hear their</b> respective <b>statements, or after you hear their statements but you do not</b> yet <b>know where the judgment is leaning, </b> it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>you to say to them: I will not submit to</b> your request to judge <b>you. </b> The judge may refuse the case out of fear that <b>perhaps the strong</b> and contentious one will <b>be</b> found <b>liable, and</b> it will <b>turn out</b> that <b>the strong</b> one will <b>pursue</b> the judge with intent to harm <b>him. </b> But <b>once you hear their statements and you know where the judgment is leaning, you may not say to them: I will not submit to</b> your request to judge <b>you, as it is stated: “You shall not be afraid before any man”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17). |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | pierce the mountain, as it is stated: “For the judgment is God’s” | Sanhedrin 6b:3 | <b>Rather, </b> the judge must assure that <b>the</b> true <b>judgment will</b> prevail at all costs and metaphorically <b>pierce the mountain, as it is stated: “For the judgment is God’s”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17). <b>And similarly, Moses would say: Let the judgment pierce the mountain. But</b> by contrast, <b>Aaron, </b> whose role was not that of a judge, was <b>a lover of peace and a pursuer of peace, and</b> he <b>would apply peace between</b> one <b>person and the other, as it is stated: “The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity”</b> (Malachi 2:6). |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | “You shall not be afraid [ taguru ]” | Sanhedrin 7a:16 | The Talmud returns to analyzing the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> expression: <b>“You shall not be afraid [<i>taguru</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>is a term for gathering in, </b> so that the term may be interpreted to mean that a judge may not keep his ruling to himself? <b>Rav Naḥman said: The verse states: </b> “You shalt plant vineyards and dress them, <b>but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather [<i>te’egor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:39). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “She provides her bread in the summer, and gathers [<i>agra</i>] her food in the harvest”</b> (Proverbs 6:8). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “A wise son gathers [<i>oger</i>] in the summer”</b> (Proverbs 10:5). |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | “You shall not respect [ takiru ] people in judgment; | Sanhedrin 7b:18 | The next verse states: <b>“You shall not respect [<i>takiru</i>] people in judgment; </b> you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid before any man, for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it” (Deuteronomy 1:17). <b>R' Yehuda says: Do not recognize him [<i>takirehu</i>], </b> i.e., do not acknowledge the litigant as a friend in your role as a judge. <b>R' Elazar says: </b> Even if he is your opponent, <b>do not estrange him [<i>tenakerehu</i>]</b> in such a way as to prejudge him as liable, but treat him as though you do not know him at all. |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | “You shall hear the small and the great alike” | Sanhedrin 8a:2 | § The Talmud continues to interpret clauses from the verse cited above. <b>“You shall hear the small and the great alike”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17). <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> This teaches <b>that the judgment of one <i>peruta</i> should be as dear, </b> i.e., important, <b>to you as the judgment of one hundred <i>maneh</i>, </b> i.e., ten thousand dinars. The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this said? <b>If we say</b> it is with regard to the need <b>to study it</b> carefully <b>and</b> to <b>decide</b> the case justly, it is <b>obvious</b> that even cases relating to small sums must be judged thoroughly. <b>Rather, </b> Reish Lakish was speaking with regard <b>to giving it precedence: </b> The small claims case may not be deferred in favor of the larger claim merely because the disputed sum is smaller. |
| Deuteronomy 1:17 | “You shall not fear | Sotah 47b:17 | § The Talmud cites statements similar to those of the Mishnah. <b>From</b> the time <b>when those who accept benefit</b> from others <b>proliferated, the laws became twisted and deeds became corrupted, and there was no comfort in the world. From</b> the time <b>when those who look at</b> the <b>faces</b> of the litigants <b>in judgment, </b> in order to rule based on the appearance of the litigants, <b>proliferated, </b> the fulfillment of the verse: <b>“You shall not fear</b> the face of any man” (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>ceased, and</b> the fulfillment of the verse: <b>“You shall not respect</b> faces in judgment” (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>halted, and they removed the yoke of Heaven</b> from themselves, <b>and placed upon themselves the yoke of flesh and blood. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:18 | “And I commanded you at that time | Sanhedrin 8a:6 | The Talmud continues to interpret verses pertaining to judges and judgment. <b>It is written: “And I charged your judges at that time”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:16), <b>and it is written</b> soon thereafter: <b>“And I commanded you at that time</b> all the things that you should do” (Deuteronomy 1:18). There is an apparent contradiction between these verses, as one indicates God commanded the judges and the other indicates He commanded the people. <b>R' Elazar says</b> that <b>R' Simlai says: </b> Moses issued <b>a warning to the community that the awe of the judge must be upon them, and</b> Moses issued <b>a warning to the judge that</b> he must <b>bear</b> the burden of <b>the community. Up to what</b> degree must the judge bear this burden? <b>R' Ḥanan, and some say R' Shabbtai, says: </b> It is as Moses said, that he carried Israel <b>“as a nursing father carries the sucking child”</b> (Numbers 11:12). |
| Deuteronomy 1:21 | as it is written: “Neither fear nor be dismayed [ teḥat ]” | Chullin 27a:8 | <b>Rav Yeimar says: </b> From where is it derived that slaughter is performed from the neck? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And you shall slaughter [<i>vezavaḥta</i>]</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the blood <b>flows [<i>shezav</i>], break it [<i>ḥattehu</i>], </b> i.e., cut it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of breaking? </b> The Talmud answers: It is inferred from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Neither fear nor be dismayed [<i>teḥat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:21); ensure that your spirit will not be broken. |
| Deuteronomy 1:22 | “that they may search the land for us” | Sotah 34b:4 | The Torah relates that the people asked Moses to send spies so <b>“that they may search the land for us”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:22). <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says: </b> When the Jewish people asked to send <b>spies, their intention was only to shame Eretz Yisrael. It is written here: “That they may search [<i>veyaḥperu</i>] the land for us, ” and it is written there: “Then the moon will be embarrassed [<i>veḥafera</i>], and the sun will be ashamed”</b> (Isaiah 24:23). |
| Deuteronomy 1:23 | “And it was good in my eyes” | Sotah 34b:3 | § Since the Talmud mentioned the cluster of grapes that the spies brought back from Eretz Yisrael, it continues discussing the story of the spies. It is stated in the Torah that God told Moses: <b>“Send you</b> men” (Numbers 13:2). <b>Reish Lakish says: “Send you”</b> means that you should send them <b>at your own discretion</b> and not as a divine command. As, if it were a divine command, <b>does a person choose a bad portion for himself? </b> Since God knew the nature of these spies and that they would ultimately slander the land, He certainly would not have sent them Himself. <b>And this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> in the passage where Moses retold the story of the spies: <b>“And it was good in my eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:23), and <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> The implication of these words is that it seemed good <b>“in my eyes, ” but not in the eyes of God. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:27 | “And you murmured [ vatteragenu ] in your tents | Shevuot 47b:5 | Commenting on the verse describing the response of the Jewish people to the spies’ slander of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“And you murmured [<i>vatteragenu</i>] in your tents</b> and said: Because YHWH hated us, He has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us” (Deuteronomy 1:27), <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says: </b> “<i>Teragenu</i>” is interpreted as though it is composed of two Hebrew expressions: <b>You explored [<i>tartem</i>]</b> the land, <b>and: You disparaged [<i>ginnitem</i>]</b> it, <b>in the tent of God. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 1:44 | As Rav Sheshet would translate | Sotah 48b:16 | The Mishnah taught: <b>And</b> the <b>sweetness of the honeycomb [<i>nofet tzufim</i>]</b> also ceased when the First Temple was destroyed. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is <b><i>nofet tzufim</i>? Rav says: Fine flour that floats</b> up and remains <b>on the top of the sieve [<i>nafa</i>], which is similar</b> in taste <b>to dough kneaded with honey and oil. And Levi says</b> that <i>nofet tzufim</i> is the term for <b>two loaves stuck together in an oven, which keep swelling until they reach each other. And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: This is honey that comes from elevated areas [<i>tzipiyya</i>]. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that this is what <i>nofet tzufim</i> is? <b>As Rav Sheshet would translate</b> the words: “As the bees do” (Deuteronomy 1:44): <b>Like the bees spread out and fly all over the world and bring honey from mountainous plants. </b> Similarly, R' Yehoshua ben Levi states that honey comes from elevated areas. |
| Deuteronomy 1:46 | as it is stated: “And you dwelled [ vateshvu ] in Kadesh for many days” | Megillah 21a:17 | The Talmud points out an apparent contradiction with regard to this very issue. <b>One verse says: “And I sat [<i>va’eshev</i>] on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:9), <b>and another verse says: “And I stood on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:10). The Talmud cites several possible resolutions. <b>Rav said: </b> Moses would <b>stand and learn</b> the Torah from God, and then <b>sit and review</b> what he had learned. <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> Moses was <b>not standing or sitting, but rather bowing. R' Yoḥanan said: </b> The term <b><i>yeshiva</i> is nothing more than an expression of remaining</b> in one place, <b>as it is stated: “And you dwelled [<i>vateshvu</i>] in Kadesh for many days”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:46). <b>Rava said: </b> Moses studied <b>easy</b> material while <b>standing and difficult</b> material while <b>sitting. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:5 | his father, as it is written: “Because I have given mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance” | Kiddushin 18a:2 | <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: By Torah law a non-Jew inherits</b> from <b>his father, as it is written: “Because I have given mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:5). The Talmud asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different</b> with regard to <b>an apostate Jew? </b> In other words, it is possible that Esau was not considered a non-Jew but rather Jewish, like the Patriarchs. Consequently, he is categorized as an apostate Jew. <b>Rather, </b> the proof is <b>from here: “Because I have given Ar to the children of Lot as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), and the descendants of Lot were certainly non-Jews. |
| Deuteronomy 2:5 | his father by Torah law, as it is stated: “Because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance” | Nazir 61a:11 | The Talmud answers: <b>Here, </b> in the case of naziriteship, it <b>is different, as the verse states: “For his father, or for his mother, </b> for his brother, or for his sister, <b>he shall not defile himself”</b> (Numbers 6:7). From here it is derived that this mitzva applies only <b>to one who has a father. </b> This <b>excludes a non-Jew, who does not have a father. </b> The Talmud asks: With regard <b>to what</b> <i>halakha</i> does a non-Jew lack a father? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>with regard to inheritance, but didn’t R' Ḥiyya bar Avin say</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: A non-Jew inherits</b> the estate of <b>his father by Torah law, as it is stated: “Because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:5)? |
| Deuteronomy 2:9 | “And the Lord said to me, do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle” | Bava Kamma38a:16 | Ulla therefore <b>went to</b> console Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>by himself, </b> and <b>said to him: </b> The verse states: <b>“And YHWH said to me, do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9). <b>What entered Moses’s mind, </b> that God had to warn him not to undertake a particular action? Did it enter his mind <b>to wage war</b> with the Moabites <b>without permission? Rather, Moses reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>by himself, saying: And if</b> with regard to <b>the Midianites, who came only to help the Moabites</b> harm the Jewish people (see Numbers, chapter 22), <b>the Torah said: “Harass the Midianites and smite them”</b> (Numbers 25:17), |
| Deuteronomy 2:9 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: “Be not at enmity with Moab” | Chullin 60b:13 | <b>Similarly, you say</b> with regard to another apparently unnecessary verse, describing a city that the Israelites conquered: <b>“For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the</b> former <b>king of Moab, </b> and taken all his land out of his hand” (Numbers 21:26). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> in knowing this information? It teaches <b>that</b> since <b>God said to Israel: “Be not at enmity with Moab”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of Moab. Therefore, <b>God said: Let Sihon come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from Moab, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from Sihon. </b> The Talmud notes: <b>And this is what Rav Pappa says: </b> The lands of <b>Ammon and Moab were purified by Sihon, </b> i.e., rendered permitted for conquest. |
| Deuteronomy 2:9 | the Merciful One said to Moses: “Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle” | Horayot 10b:19 | § Apropos Lot and his daughters, <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God does not withhold even</b> the <b>reward for euphemistic speech? </b> It is derived <b>from here, as the elder</b> daughter <b>called her son Moab, </b> an allusion to the fact that the child is from her own father [<i>me’av</i>], and <b>God said to Moses: “Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9). From this it may be inferred: <b>It is</b> in <b>battle</b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:9 | from here: “Because I have given Ar to the children of Lot as an inheritance” | Kiddushin 18a:2 | <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: By Torah law a non-Jew inherits</b> from <b>his father, as it is written: “Because I have given mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:5). The Talmud asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different</b> with regard to <b>an apostate Jew? </b> In other words, it is possible that Esau was not considered a non-Jew but rather Jewish, like the Patriarchs. Consequently, he is categorized as an apostate Jew. <b>Rather, </b> the proof is <b>from here: “Because I have given Ar to the children of Lot as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), and the descendants of Lot were certainly non-Jews. |
| Deuteronomy 2:9 | “Do not besiege Moab, nor contend with them in war” | Nazir 23b:11 | <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God does not deprive</b> one of <b>even</b> the <b>reward for proper speech, </b> i.e., for speaking in a refined manner? <b>As while</b> there is the case of Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter, <b>who called</b> her son <b>Moab [<i>mo’av</i>], </b> which alludes to his shameful origins, as <i>me’av</i> means: From father, <b>and God says to</b> Moses: <b>“Do not besiege Moab, nor contend with them in war”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), which indicates: It is <b>war that is not</b> permitted; <b>however, </b> with regard to <b>harassing, </b> the Jews were permitted <b>to harass them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:16 | did not speak with Moses, as it is stated: “So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people” | Bava Batra121b:1 | God <b>did not speak with Moses, as it is stated: “So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:16), <b>and juxtaposed to</b> that verse it is written: <b>“That YHWH spoke to me, saying”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:17). Moses indicates: Only after the last of that generation had died, <b>was the speech</b> of God directed <b>to me. </b> When the Jewish people realized that the decree had been lifted, the day was established as a permanent day of rejoicing. |
| Deuteronomy 2:17 | “That the Lord spoke to me, saying” | Bava Batra121b:1 | God <b>did not speak with Moses, as it is stated: “So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:16), <b>and juxtaposed to</b> that verse it is written: <b>“That YHWH spoke to me, saying”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:17).

| Deuteronomy 2:19 | the Holy One, Blessed be He said to Moses: “And when you come near against the children of Ammon, do not harass them, nor contend with them” | Bava Kamma38b:6 | By contrast, with regard to the descendants of the <b>younger</b> daughter, <b>who said</b> her son’s name would be <b>ben Ami, </b> meaning: Son of my nation, merely alluding to the fact she conceived him through an incestuous union, <b>God said to Moses: “And when you come near against the children of Ammon, do not harass them, nor contend with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:19). In other words, do not contend with them <b>at all; do not even impose forced labor on them. </b> This additional prohibition was a reward for her employing a euphemism when naming her son. |
| Deuteronomy 2:19 | “Neither harass them, nor contend with them” | Horayot 11a:1 | <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> contend with them, <b>but</b> it is permitted <b>to harass them. While</b> concerning the offspring of <b>the younger daughter, who called</b> her son <b>ben Ami, </b> son of my people, avoiding any direct mention of the baby’s father, God <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>“Neither harass them, nor contend with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:19), <b>at all. Even</b> to <b>harass</b> them is <b>not</b> permitted. |
| Deuteronomy 2:19 | “Do not harass them, nor contend with them” | Nazir 23b:12 | <b>And while</b> there is the case of Lot’s <b>younger</b> daughter, <b>who called</b> her son <b>Ben-Ami, </b> son of my people, without explicitly mentioning her father. With regard to her descendants, God <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>“Do not harass them, nor contend with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:19), which means <b>even</b> as far as <b>harassing</b> is concerned, <b>you may not harass them at all. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:23 | “And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, | Chullin 60b:11 | The Talmud cites another statement related to the Avvim: <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: </b> There are <b>many verses that</b> are seemingly <b>fit to be burned as books of the heretics, </b> since they appear redundant or frivolous, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are themselves the essence of Torah. </b> For example, the verse states: <b>“And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, </b> the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead” (Deuteronomy 2:23). <b>What</b> practical <b>difference</b> does this make <b>for us? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:25 | “I will begin to deliver the dread of you | Avodah Zarah25a:7 | <b>It is taught: Just as the sun stood</b> still <b>for Joshua, so</b> too <b>the sun stood</b> still <b>for Moses and for Nakdimon ben Guryon. </b> It is known that it stood still for <b>Joshua</b> from <b>a verse, </b> and it is known that it stood still for <b>Nakdimon ben Guryon</b> by <b>tradition. From where do we</b> derive that it stood still <b>for Moses</b> as well? The Talmud answers: It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“I will begin”</b> and <b>“I will begin. ”</b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to Moses: <b>“I will begin to deliver the dread of you</b> and the fear of you upon the peoples” (Deuteronomy 2:25), <b>and it is written there, with regard to Joshua: “I will begin to magnify you”</b> (Joshua 3:7). |
| Deuteronomy 2:25 | when they hear the report of you, shall tremble and be in anguish because of you” | Avodah Zarah25a:9 | <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that there is no need for a verbal analogy, as <b>you</b> can <b>learn</b> this idea <b>from the verse itself: </b> “This day will I begin to deliver the dread of you and the fear of you upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who, <b>when they hear the report of you, shall tremble and be in anguish because of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>When</b> was the fulfillment of the prophecy that all the nations <b>“shall tremble and be in anguish because of you”? </b> It was <b>at the time when the sun stood</b> still <b>for Moses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:25 | I will begin to put the dread of you | Taanit 20a:6 | <b>R' Elazar said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between <b>“I will begin”</b> and <b>“I will begin. ” Here, </b> with regard to Moses, <b>it is written: </b> “This day <b>I will begin to put the dread of you</b> and the fear of you upon the peoples that are under all the whole heaven” (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>And there, </b> with regard to Joshua, <b>it is written: </b> “On this day <b>I will begin to magnify you</b> in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you” (Joshua 3:7). The repeated use of the phrase “I will begin” indicates that all the miracles performed for Joshua were also performed for Moses. |
| Deuteronomy 2:25 | it is written: “I will begin to put the dread of you” | Taanit 20a:7 | <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: </b> The fact that the sun stood still for Moses is <b>derived</b> by a different verbal analogy, between the terms <b>“put”</b> and <b>“put. ” Here, </b> with regard to Moses, <b>it is written: “I will begin to put the dread of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>And there, </b> with regard to Joshua, <b>is it written: </b> “Then Joshua spoke to YHWH, <b>on the day when YHWH put the Amorites</b> before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel: Sun, stand still upon Gibeon, and you, moon, in the valley of Aijalon” (Joshua 10:12). |
| Deuteronomy 2:25 | who, when they hear the report of you, shall tremble, and be in anguish due to you” | Taanit 20a:8 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> This idea is <b>derived from the verse itself, </b> as it says with regard to Moses: “This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the peoples that are under all the whole heaven, <b>who, when they hear the report of you, shall tremble, and be in anguish due to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>When</b> did the nations of the world <b>tremble and</b> when were they <b>in anguish due to you? When the sun broke through for Moses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 2:28 | “You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink” | Avodah Zarah37b:15 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And boiled</b> vegetables prepared by non-Jews are prohibited. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: The verse states</b> that when Moses asked Sihon, King of the Amorites, for passage through his land, he said: <b>“You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:28). By juxtaposing food and water, the verse teaches that food is <b>like water: Just as</b> Moses wished to purchase <b>water that was unchanged, so too, </b> he wished to purchase <b>food that was unchanged, </b> i.e., uncooked. Evidently, this is because foods cooked by non-Jews are prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 3:4 | Wasn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argov” | Megillah 10a:10 | The Talmud <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>. <b>R' Yishmael ben Yosei, said: Were these</b> cities that were enumerated in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> <b>the only</b> walled cities? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argov”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:4), <b>and</b> concerning these cities <b>it is written: “All these cities were fortified with high walls, </b> gates and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:5), indicating that there were a great number of walled cities? <b>Rather, why then did the rabbis enumerate these</b> specific cities? It is due to the fact <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>they discovered these and consecrated them</b> as walled cities. |
| Deuteronomy 3:5 | walls, | Arakhin 33b:22 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that it is considered a walled city <b>even</b> if <b>Jews surrounded it</b> with a wall and only then built houses inside it. Therefore, <b>it is stated here: </b> “And if a man sells a dwelling house in <b>a walled</b> city,” <b>and it is stated below, </b> with regard to the conquest of the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan: “All these were fortified cities, with high <b>walls, </b> gates, and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:5). <b>Just as below, </b> the verse is referring to cities whose surrounding walls were constructed by <b>non-Jews, so too here, </b> the verse is referring only to cities whose walls were constructed by <b>non-Jews. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 3:5 | it is written: “All these cities were fortified with high walls, | Megillah 10a:10 | The Talmud <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>. <b>R' Yishmael ben Yosei, said: Were these</b> cities that were enumerated in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> <b>the only</b> walled cities? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argov”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:4), <b>and</b> concerning these cities <b>it is written: “All these cities were fortified with high walls, </b> gates and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:5), indicating that there were a great number of walled cities? <b>Rather, why then did the rabbis enumerate these</b> specific cities?

| Deuteronomy 3:5 | besides unwalled towns, a great many” | Megillah 2b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> Mishnah? The Talmud explains: It is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>unwalled and</b> another instance of the word <b>unwalled. It is written here: “Therefore the Jews of the villages, </b> who dwell in the unwalled towns” (Esther 9:19), <b>and it is written there, </b> in Moses’ statement to Joshua before the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael: “All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates and bars; <b>besides unwalled towns, a great many”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:5). <b>Just as there, </b> in Deuteronomy, the reference is to a city <b>that was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, so too here</b> it is referring to a city <b>that was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 3:9 | “Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, | Chullin 60b:14 | The Talmud cites another seemingly superfluous verse, describing Mount Hermon: <b>“Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, </b> and the Amorites call it Senir” (Deuteronomy 3:9). A Sage <b>taught: Senir and Sirion are mountains of Eretz Yisrael. </b> The verse <b>teaches that every one of the nations of the world went and built itself a great city</b> on Mount Hermon, <b>and named it after</b> one of <b>the mountains of Eretz Yisrael, teaching you that even the mountains of Eretz Yisrael are beloved by the nations of the world. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 3:23 | [ titḥonen ], as it is written: “And I pleaded [ va’etḥanan ] before the Lord” | Berakhot 30b:9 | The Talmud points out that both Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda based their positions on the prayers of Moses. <b>The one who said: So that his mind will be in a pleading</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥonen</i>], as it is written: “And I pleaded [<i>va’etḥanan</i>] before YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And the one who said: So that his mind will be in a beseeching</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥolel</i>] as it is written: “And Moses besought [<i>vayeḥal</i>] YHWH”</b> (Exodus 32:11). |
| Deuteronomy 3:23 | “And I beseeched the Lord at that time” | Berakhot 32a:32 | Based on Moses’ prayers, <b>R' Simlai taught: One should always set forth praise of God and then pray</b> for his own needs. <b>From where do we</b> derive that one should conduct himself in this manner? <b>From Moses, as it is written</b> in his prayer: <b>“And I beseeched YHWH at that time”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And</b> immediately afterward in his prayer, <b>it is written: “Lord, God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for what God is there in the heavens or on earth who can perform deeds such as Yours and Your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:24)?

| Deuteronomy 3:24 | from Moses our teacher, as it is written: “O Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant | Avodah Zarah7b:18 | They disagree <b>with regard to that which R' Simlai taught.

Here Moses praises God, <b>and it is written afterward, </b> in the following verse, that then Moses requested from God: <b>“Let me go over, I pray You, and see the good land”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25). |
| Deuteronomy 3:24 | it is written: “Lord, God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for what God is there in the heavens or on earth who can perform deeds such as Yours and Your might” | Berakhot 32a:32 | Based on Moses’ prayers, <b>R' Simlai taught: One should always set forth praise of God and then pray</b> for his own needs. <b>From where do we</b> derive that one should conduct himself in this manner? <b>From Moses, as it is written</b> in his prayer: <b>“And I beseeched YHWH at that time”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And</b> immediately afterward in his prayer, <b>it is written: “Lord, God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand, for what God is there in the heavens or on earth who can perform deeds such as Yours and Your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:24)?

| Deuteronomy 3:25 | Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon” | Berakhot 48b:5 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Grace after Meals is from the Torah? As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless</b> YHWH, your God, for the good land that He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Talmud explains: <b>And you shall bless, that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all. <b>YHWH, your God, that is the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> in which God’s name is invoked. <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land; good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25), which is interpreted homiletically as referring to Jerusalem and the Temple. <b>That He gave you, that is: Who is good and does good. </b> However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>You said</b> that it can be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: When one is satisfied, he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> and thank God for food; <b>when he is hungry, all the more so</b> that he should recite a blessing to offer thanks for the food he will eat. |
| Deuteronomy 3:25 | only the Temple, as it is stated: “That good mountain and the Lebanon” | Gittin 56b:1 | <b>in truth, you are a king, </b> if not now, then in the future. <b>As if you are not a king, Jerusalem will not be handed over into your hand, as it is written: “And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one”</b> (Isaiah 10:34). <b>And “mighty one”</b> means <b>only a king, as it is written: “And their mighty one shall be of themselves, </b> and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them” (Jeremiah 30:21), indicating that “mighty one” parallels “ruler. ” <b>And “Lebanon”</b> means <b>only the Temple, as it is stated: “That good mountain and the Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25). <b>And</b> as for <b>what you said</b> with your second comment: <b>If I am a king why didn’t you come to me until now, there are zealots among us</b> who <b>did not allow us</b> to do this. |
| Deuteronomy 3:26 | “And the Lord said to me: Let it suffice for you [ rav lakh ]; | Sotah 13b:13 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>Who, to us, </b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses, </b> as no one involved himself in his burial other than God Himself. The Talmud teaches: When Moses relates how God responded to him when denying his request to enter Eretz Yisrael, he states: <b>“And YHWH said to me: Let it suffice for you [<i>rav lakh</i>]; </b> speak no more to Me of this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26). <b>R' Levi says: </b> Moses <b>proclaimed</b> to the Jewish people when rebuking them <b>with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>, ”</b> and therefore <b>it was proclaimed to him with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>”</b> that he would not enter Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud explains: <b>He proclaimed with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>”</b> when speaking with the congregation of Korah: <b>“You take too much upon you [<i>rav lakhem</i>], </b> you sons of Levi” (Numbers 16:7), and <b>it was proclaimed to him with</b> the term <b>“<i>rav</i>, ”</b> as God denied his request and said: <b>“Let it suffice for you [<i>rav lakh</i>]. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 3:28 | a galvanization? As it is written: “And command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him” | Kiddushin 29a:14 | The Talmud elaborates: From where is it derived that the term “command” indicates <b>a galvanization? As it is written: “And command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:28). In this context, the term “command” is not referring to a specific command but is a general expression of galvanization. From where is it derived that this applies <b>immediately and for generations? As it is written: “From the day that YHWH commanded and onward throughout your generations”</b> (Numbers 15:23). This shows that whenever the word “command” is used it is referring to that day onward for all generations. |
| Deuteronomy 4:2 | states: “You shall not add to the word | Rosh Hashanah28b:10 | <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a priest who went up to the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Blessing <b>should not say: Since the Torah granted me permission to bless the Jewish people, I will add a blessing of my own, </b> which is not part of the Priestly Blessing stated in the Torah, <b>for example: </b> “May <b>YHWH God of your fathers make you</b> a thousand times <b>as many as you are”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:11)? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “You shall not add to the word</b> which I command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2). <b>But here, since</b> the priest already <b>recited</b> the Priestly <b>Blessing, the time</b> of the mitzva <b>has passed, </b> and according to Rava, after the prescribed time for performing a mitzva, one does not transgress the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, yet <b>it</b> nevertheless <b>teaches that he has transgressed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:4 | “But You who cleave to the Lord your God, are alive every one of you this day” | Ketubot 111b:6 | <b>Since</b> R' Elazar <b>saw that</b> R' Yoḥanan <b>was grieved</b> over the distress of common, uneducated people, <b>he said to him: My teacher, I have found for them a remedy from the Torah</b> so that they will merit life in the World-to-Come, as it states: <b>“But You who cleave to YHWH your God, are alive every one of you this day”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:4). <b>But is it possible to cleave to the Shekhina? Isn’t it written: For YHWH your God is a devouring fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24)? |
| Deuteronomy 4:4 | “But you who did cleave [ hadevekim ] to the Lord your God” | Sanhedrin 64a:11 | Rav Yehuda adds: <b>You, the house of Israel, are not like that</b> woman who could not bear the repulsiveness of Ba’al-Peor. It is stated with regard to the attitude of the Jewish people toward idol worship: <b>“That have attached themselves [<i>hanitzmadim</i>] to Ba’al-Peor”</b> (Numbers 25:5), indicating a tight attachment, <b>like a tightly bound cover [<i>ketzamid patil</i>]</b> tied firmly onto a vessel. Yet with regard to the attitude of the Jewish people toward God it is stated: <b>“But you who did cleave [<i>hadevekim</i>] to YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:4), i.e., the connection between the Jewish people and God is <b>like two dates that</b> are lightly <b>attached [<i>hadevukot</i>] to one another</b> but are not tightly pressed together. |
| Deuteronomy 4:4 | “But you who cleave to the Lord your God every one of you is alive this day” | Sanhedrin 90b:13 | <b>And there are those who say</b> that it is <b>from this</b> following <b>verse</b> that <b>he said to them</b> his ultimate proof: <b>“But you who cleave to YHWH your God every one of you is alive this day”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:4). Wasn’t it <b>obvious</b> with regard to the children of Israel whom God was addressing, that <b>“every one of you is alive this day”? Rather, </b> the meaning of the verse is: <b>Even on the day when everyone is dead you will live; just as today every one of you is alive, so too, in the World-to-Come every one of you</b> will be <b>alive. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:5 | “As the Lord my God commanded me” | Avodah Zarah17b:14 | The Romans <b>brought R' Ḥanina ben Teradyon</b> for judgment, and they <b>said to him: Why did you occupy yourself with the Torah? </b> R' Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>said to them, </b> citing a verse: <b>“As YHWH my God commanded me”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:5). <b>They immediately sentenced him to</b> death by means of <b>burning, and</b> they sentenced <b>his wife to execution</b> by decapitation, <b>and his daughter</b> was condemned <b>to sit in a brothel [<i>kubba shel zonot</i>]. </b> The Talmud explains the Divine decree that he should receive this punishment: <b>He</b> was sentenced <b>to</b> death by <b>burning, as he would</b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:5 | as the verse states: “Behold, I have taught you | Bekhorot 29a:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the rulings of one who takes wages to judge cases are void. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter, </b> that a judge may not be paid for his rulings, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that it is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “Behold, I have taught you</b> statutes and ordinances, as YHWH my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land that you are going in to possess” (Deuteronomy 4:5). This teaches that <b>just as I, </b> Moses, learned the word of God <b>for free, so too, you</b> learned it from me <b>for free, </b> and this is also how you should act with all future generations. |
| Deuteronomy 4:5 | as the Lord my God commanded me” | Bekhorot 29a:8 | <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, <b>as YHWH my God commanded me”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:5). <b>Just as I</b> learned from God <b>for free, so too, you</b> learned from me <b>for free. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>cannot find</b> someone to teach him <b>for free that he should learn</b> even <b>by</b> giving <b>payment? The verse states: “Buy the truth, </b> and do not sell it; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one <b>should not say: Just as I learned by</b> giving <b>payment, so too, I will teach it by</b> receiving <b>payment? The verse states: “Buy the truth, and do not sell it. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:5 | commanded me, | Nedarim 37a:2 | The Talmud asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is midrash different</b> from Bible, <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> take payment for teaching it? Based on that <b>which is written, </b> which Moses said to the people: <b>“And YHWH commanded me at that time to teach you</b> statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14), <b>and</b> also that which <b>is written: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as YHWH</b> my God <b>commanded me, </b> that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it” (Deuteronomy 4:5), God said: <b>Just as I</b> teach you <b>for free, </b> without payment, <b>so too you also</b> shall teach <b>for free. </b> There should be no difference between Bible and midrash, and <b>Bible too, </b> like midrash, should be taught <b>for free. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:5 | “Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as the Lord my God commanded me” | Nedarim 38a:5 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</b> from the verse that states: <b>“And YHWH commanded me at that time to teach you</b> statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14). This indicates that Moses was commanded to teach Torah to the Jewish people from the outset. The Talmud answers: The verse means: <b>And YHWH commanded</b> the Torah to <b>me, </b> Moses, <b>and I, </b> on my own initiative, decided <b>to</b> teach <b>you</b> its statutes and laws. The Talmud cites an additional verse proving that God commanded to teach the Jewish people from the outset: <b>“Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as YHWH my God commanded me”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:5). The Talmud answers: <b>YHWH commanded</b> the Torah to <b>me, </b> Moses, <b>and I</b> decided <b>to</b> teach <b>you</b> statutes and laws. |
| Deuteronomy 4:6 | come and strike the faces of the nations of the world in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Observe therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations” | Avodah Zarah4b:16 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: All of the mitzvot that the Jewish people perform in this world</b> will <b>come and strike the faces of the nations of the world in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Observe therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:6). It <b>is not stated: Before the nations; rather, </b> the verse states: <b>“In the eyes of the nations, ”</b> which taken literally <b>teaches that they</b> will <b>come and strike the faces of the nations of the world in the World-to-Come. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:6 | constellations? As it was stated: “And you shall guard and perform, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations” | Shabbat 75a:4 | <b>R' Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: Anyone who knows how to calculate astronomical seasons and</b> the movement of <b>constellations and does not do so, the verse says about him: “They do not take notice of the work of God, and they do not see His handiwork”</b> (Isaiah 5:12). And <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> there is <b>a mitzva</b> incumbent <b>upon a person to calculate astronomical seasons and</b> the movement of <b>constellations? As it was stated: “And you shall guard and perform, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:6). <b>What wisdom and understanding</b> is there in the Torah <b>that is in the eyes of the nations, </b> i.e., appreciated and recognized by all? <b>You must say: This is the calculation of astronomical seasons and</b> the movement of <b>constellations, </b> as the calculation of experts is witnessed by all. |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | “For who is a great nation, | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation, </b> to whom God is close, like YHWH our God whenever we call upon Him? ” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation, </b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today? ” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel, </b> who is like you? A people saved by YHWH, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to YHWH, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | from here: “For what nation is there so great, that has God so near to them” | Megillah 11a:9 | <b>Rav Mattana said</b> his introduction <b>from here: “For what nation is there so great, that has God so near to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), as to witness the great miracles in the days of Mordecai and Esther? <b>Rav Ashi said</b> his introduction <b>from here: </b> The verse states: <b>“Or has God ventured</b> to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation? ” (Deuteronomy 4:34), as in the times of Esther, God saved the Jewish people who were scattered throughout the Persian Empire. |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | be torn up? As it is stated: “As is the Lord our God whenever we call out to Him” | Rosh Hashanah18a:10 | <b>Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the sentence of a community is never sealed [<i>neḥtam</i>]? </b> The Talmud immediately asks: <b>Is never sealed? But isn’t it written: “Yet the stain [<i>nikhtam</i>] of your iniquity is before Me”</b> (Jeremiah 2:22), which implies that the sentence of a community is indeed sealed. <b>Rather, </b> one must say that the question was as follows: From where is it known with regard to the sentence of a community that <b>although it is sealed, it can</b> still <b>be torn up? As it is stated: “As is YHWH our God whenever we call out to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7). This implies that there is always a way to draw close to God. |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | “For what nation is there so great that has God so near to them as the Lord our God is whenever we call upon Him?” | Sanhedrin 38b:15 | R' Yoḥanan cites several examples where the counterclaim is in the same verse as the claim of the heretics. The verse states: <b>“For what nation is there so great that has God so near to them as YHWH our God is whenever we call upon Him? ”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), where the term “near” is written in plural, <i>kerovim</i>, but the term “upon Him” is written in singular. Another verse states: <b>“And who is like Your people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people? ”</b> (II Samuel 7:23), where the term “went” is written in plural, <i>halekhu</i>, but the term “Himself” is written in singular. Another verse states: “I beheld <b>till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit”</b> (Daniel 7:9); where the term “thrones” is written in plural, <i>kharsavan</i>, but the term “sit” is written in singular. |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | as the Lord our God is whenever we call upon Him?” | Yevamot 105a:17 | <b>Rather, </b> one must say as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>even when</b> a community’s sentence <b>is sealed, it may be torn up</b> as a result of repentance, <b>as it is stated: “For what</b> great nation is there, that has God so close unto them, <b>as YHWH our God is whenever we call upon Him? ”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7). The Talmud objects: <b>But isn’t it written</b> in another verse: <b>“Seek YHWH while He may be found, </b> call upon Him when He is near<b>”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), implying that God is not always near and may not always answer whenever we call upon Him? The Talmud answers: This contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> verse <b>is concerning an individual</b> who must seek God where He is found, as He is not always equally accessible to answer those who call out to Him. <b>That</b> first verse <b>is concerning a community, </b> for whom He is accessible “whenever we call upon Him. ” |
| Deuteronomy 4:7 | as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?” | Yevamot 49b:7 | The Talmud expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said: </b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him. </b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw YHWH sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said: </b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as YHWH our God is, whenever we call upon Him? ”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek YHWH while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6). |
| Deuteronomy 4:8 | “And who is a great nation, | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation, </b> to whom God is close, like YHWH our God whenever we call upon Him? ” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation, </b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today? ” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel, </b> who is like you?

| Deuteronomy 4:9 | from Mount Horeb. As it is stated: “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children” | Berakhot 21b:15 | At any rate, we see that in Deuteronomy, R' Yehuda derives homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed verses. Why does he fail to derive that one who experiences a seminal emission is prohibited from engaging in matters of Torah from the juxtaposition of the verses? <b>They replied: Indeed, in <i>Mishne Torah</i></b> R' Yehuda <b>does derive homiletic interpretations</b> from the juxtaposition of verses, <b>but</b> he requires <b>these juxtaposed verses</b> in order <b>to</b> derive <b>another</b> statement of <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi, as R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes to him</b> credit <b>as if he received</b> the Torah <b>from Mount Horeb. As it is stated: “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9) <b>after which it is written: “The day that you stood before YHWH your God at Horeb. ”</b> Therefore, R' Yehuda cannot derive from that same juxtaposition a prohibition banning one who experienced a seminal emission from engaging in matters of Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | and you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children” | Berakhot 21b:8 | We learned in the Mishnah that <b>R' Yehuda says</b> with regard to one who experiences a seminal emission; <b>he recites a blessing beforehand and afterward</b> in both the case of <i>Shema</i> and in the case of food. The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that R' Yehuda holds that one who experienced a seminal emission is permitted</b> to engage <b>in matters of Torah? Didn’t R' Yehoshua ben Levi say: From where</b> in the Torah is it derived <b>that one who experiences a seminal emission is prohibited from</b> engaging <b>in matters of Torah? As it is stated: </b> “Just take heed and guard your soul diligently lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart, for all the days of your life, <b>and you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9), from which we derive, among other things, the obligation to study Torah. <b>And, juxtaposed to it, </b> is the verse: <b>“The day that you stood</b> before YHWH your God at Horeb” (Deuteronomy 4:10). This juxtaposition teaches us that <b>just as below, </b> at the revelation at Mount Sinai, <b>those who experienced a seminal emission were prohibited</b> and were commanded to refrain from sex with their wives and immerse themselves, <b>so too here, </b> throughout the generations, <b>those who experience a seminal emission are prohibited</b> from engaging in Torah study. |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children” | Berakhot 22a:4 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9), <b>and it is written thereafter: “The day that you stood before YHWH your God at Horeb”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:10). <b>Just as below, </b> the Revelation at Sinai was <b>in reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling, so too here, </b> in every generation, Torah must be studied with a sense of <b>reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | Isn’t it written in your Torah: “Take utmost care and guard yourself diligently” | Berakhot 32b:30 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There was <b>a</b> related <b>incident, involving a particular pious man who was praying</b> while traveling <b>along his path</b> when <b>an officer [<i>hegmon</i>] came and greeted him. </b> The pious man did not pause from his prayer <b>and did not respond with a greeting. </b> The officer <b>waited for him until he finished his prayer. </b><b><b>After he finished his prayer, </b> the officer <b>said to him: </b> You <b>good for nothing. </b> You endangered yourself; I could have killed you. <b><b>Isn’t it written in your Torah: “Take utmost care and guard yourself diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9)? <br><b>And it is</b> also <b>written: “Take therefore good heed unto yourselves”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:15)? Why did you ignore the danger to your life? <b><b>When I greeted you, why did you not respond with a greeting? </b> <b><b>Were I to sever your head with a sword, who would hold me accountable for your</b> spilled <b>blood? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | “But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons” | Kiddushin 30a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But is one’s father’s father obligated</b> to teach him Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), indicates: <b>But not your sons’ sons? And how do I realize, </b> i.e., understand, the meaning of the verse: <b>“But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9)? This serves <b>to say to you</b> that <b>whoever teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he taught him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the end of all generations. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | observe for yourself, and guard your soul diligently, lest you forget the matters | Menachot 99b:3 | <b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who causes himself to forget</b> even <b>one matter from his studies violates a prohibition, as it is stated</b> with regard to the receiving of the Torah on Mount Sinai: “Only <b>observe for yourself, and guard your soul diligently, lest you forget the matters</b> that your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life, but you should make them known to your children and to your children’s children” (Deuteronomy 4:9). <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the principle that <b>R' Avin</b> says that <b>R' Ile’a says, as R' Avin says</b> that <b>R' Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated: Observe, </b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:9 | as it is written: “Only observe for yourself, and keep your soul diligently” | Shevuot 36a:20 | The Talmud proceeds to cite sources for these prohibitions. The prohibition against cursing <b>oneself</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Only observe for yourself, and keep your soul diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9). This is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which R' Avin says that R' Ile’a says: Everywhere</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the terms <b>observe, lest, or do not are stated, it is nothing other than a prohibition. </b> One who curses himself does not keep, i.e., take care of, himself and consequently violates the prohibition. <b>And</b> cursing <b>another</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Do not curse the deaf”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which applies to others just as it does to one who is deaf. |
| Deuteronomy 4:10 | “The day that you stood | Berakhot 21b:8 | We learned in the Mishnah that <b>R' Yehuda says</b> with regard to one who experiences a seminal emission; <b>he recites a blessing beforehand and afterward</b> in both the case of <i>Shema</i> and in the case of food.

| Deuteronomy 4:14 | “And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you | Nedarim 37a:2 | The Talmud asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is midrash different</b> from Bible, <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> take payment for teaching it?

| Deuteronomy 4:14 | “And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you | Nedarim 38a:5 | <b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</b> from the verse that states: <b>“And YHWH commanded me at that time to teach you</b> statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14).

| Deuteronomy 4:14 | states: “And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances” | Sanhedrin 21b:25 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to Moses</b> the verse <b>states: “And YHWH commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:14), and <b>with regard to Ezra</b> the verse <b>states: “For Ezra had set his heart to seek the Torah of YHWH his God and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances”</b> (Ezra 7:10). <b>And even though</b> the <b>Torah was not given</b> literally <b>by him, the script</b> of the Torah <b>was changed by him, as it is stated: </b> |

| Deuteronomy 4:16 | idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image” | Avodah Zarah23b:9 | The Talmud supports this claim: Corruption is a reference to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood: “And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12). <b>And</b> corruption also is a reference to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). <b>And consequently, </b> with regard to the red <b>heifer also, since a blemish disqualifies it, a matter of licentiousness and idol worship</b> likewise <b>disqualify it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:16 | idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female” | Bekhorot 57a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> supports this claim: Corruption is a reference to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood: “And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12). <b>And</b> corruption is also a reference to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). |
| Deuteronomy 4:16 | idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly [ tashḥitun ], and make you a graven image” | Chullin 23a:3 | Corruption is also referring to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly [<i>tashḥitun</i>], and make you a graven image”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16); one might have thought: <b>Any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish disqualifies, matters of licentiousness and idol worship disqualify it, and any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish does not disqualify, matters of licentiousness and idol worship do not disqualify it.

Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> from the phrase in the verse “of doves or of young pigeons” that a bird that was the object of bestiality and a bird that was worshipped as a deity are disqualified. |
| Deuteronomy 4:16 | idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make | Sanhedrin 57a:1 | <b>as it is written: “And the earth was corrupt before God”</b> (Genesis 6:11), presumably referring to a transgression, <b>and the school of R' Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship. </b> The Talmud cites proofs for this claim: Corruption refers to <b>a matter of licentiousness, as it is stated: “For all flesh had corrupted their way</b> upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sex. <b>And</b> corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make</b> you a graven image” (Deuteronomy 4:16). |
| Deuteronomy 4:16 | idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image even the form of any figure” | Temurah 28b:17 | Corruption refers to <b>a matter of sexual immorality, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood, which was steeped in sexual immorality: “And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted</b> its way upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12). Corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image even the form of any figure”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). Since the term corruption is also used with regard to blemished animals, the following may be derived: In <b>any</b> case <b>in which a blemish disqualifies</b> an animal from the altar, <b>a matter of sexual immorality, </b> such as an animal that copulated with a person or an animal that was the object of bestiality, <b>or</b> their use as an object of <b>idol worship, </b> also <b>disqualifies them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:17 | “The likeness of any winged bird [ tzippor ]” | Chullin 139b:17 | The Talmud attempts to reject the above assertion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the verse with regard to the prohibition against fashioning idols: <b>“The likeness of any winged bird [<i>tzippor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:17). <b>What, is it not</b> that the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> is referring to any bird, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher, </b> and the word <b>“winged”</b> adds the likeness of <b>grasshoppers</b> to the prohibition? If so, we have found that a non-kosher bird is called a <i>tzippor</i>. The Talmud rejects this: <b>No, </b> the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> means <b>a kosher</b> bird, while the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>non-kosher</b> birds <b>and</b> to <b>grasshoppers. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:19 | which the Lord your God has allotted [ ḥalak ] to all the nations | Avodah Zarah55a:9 | Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Yitzḥak: <b>Now, were I dead I would not</b> have been able to <b>tell you</b> the explanation of <b>this matter. </b> It is therefore good that you reminded me of this matter while I am alive. The explanation is <b>as Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: </b> “And lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heavens, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, <b>which YHWH your God has allotted [<i>ḥalak</i>] to all the nations</b> under the whole heaven” (Deuteronomy 4:19). The verse <b>teaches that</b> God allowed the nations to be <b>misled [<i>sheheḥelikan</i>] by matters</b> that seemingly indicate that idol worship is effective <b>in order to expel</b> the nations <b>from the world</b> due to their decision to engage in idol worship. |
| Deuteronomy 4:19 | “I have not taken one item of value [ ḥemed ] from them,” | Megillah 9b:1 | Instead of Moses’ assertion: “I have not taken one donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] from them” (Numbers 16:15), they wrote in more general terms: <b>“I have not taken one item of value [<i>ḥemed</i>] from them, ”</b> to prevent the impression that Moses took other items. To the verse that discusses the worship of the sun and the moon, about which it is written: “Which YHWH your God has allotted to all the nations” (Deuteronomy 4:19), they added a word to make it read: <b>“Which YHWH your God has allotted to give light to all the nations, ”</b> to prevent the potential misinterpretation that the heavenly bodies were given to the non-Jews so that they may worship them. |
| Deuteronomy 4:24 | “For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God” | Avodah Zarah54b:18 | <b>A certain philosopher asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah</b> with regard to the prohibition against idol worship: <b>“For YHWH your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>For what</b> reason is <b>He jealous</b> and does He exact vengeance <b>from the</b> idol’s <b>worshippers, but</b> He is <b>not jealous of</b> the idol <b>itself</b> and does not destroy it? |
| Deuteronomy 4:24 | “For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God” | Avodah Zarah55a:2 | § <b>Agrippas</b> the <b>general asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“For YHWH your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>Doesn’t</b> jealousy arise <b>only</b> in the following cases: <b>A wise man</b> might be <b>jealous of</b> another <b>wise man, and a mighty</b> man might be jealous <b>of</b> another <b>mighty</b> man, <b>and a rich</b> man might be jealous <b>of</b> another <b>rich</b> man? If so, why is God jealous of objects of idol worship, which are not gods? |
| Deuteronomy 4:24 | But is it possible to cleave to the Divine Presence? Isn’t it written: For the Lord your God is a devouring fire” | Ketubot 111b:6 | <b>Since</b> R' Elazar <b>saw that</b> R' Yoḥanan <b>was grieved</b> over the distress of common, uneducated people, <b>he said to him: My teacher, I have found for them a remedy from the Torah</b> so that they will merit life in the World-to-Come, as it states: <b>“But You who cleave to YHWH your God, are alive every one of you this day”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:4). <b>But is it possible to cleave to the Shekhina? Isn’t it written: For YHWH your God is a devouring fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24)? |
| Deuteronomy 4:24 | I will not pay the head tax. | Nedarim 62b:3 | <b>And Rava said</b> further: <b>It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I am a servant</b> of the priests <b>of fire</b> worship and therefore <b>I will not pay the head tax. </b> Rava maintains that a scholar may issue a statement of this kind in a place where the priests of fire-worshippers are exempt from the head tax, because he actually is declaring himself a servant of God, who is referred to as “a devouring fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>What is the reason</b> that he is allowed to make this statement? He <b>is saying</b> it merely in order <b>to chase a lion</b> away <b>from him, </b> i.e., to avoid suffering a loss. |
| Deuteronomy 4:24 | possible for a person to follow the Divine Presence? But hasn’t it already been stated: “For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, | Sotah 14a:3 | <b>And R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “After YHWH your God shall you walk, </b> and Him shall you fear, and His commandments shall you keep, and unto His voice shall you hearken, and Him shall you serve, and unto Him shall you cleave” (Deuteronomy 13:5)? <b>But is it</b> actually <b>possible for a person to follow the Shekhina?

| Deuteronomy 4:25 | “When you will beget children, and children’s children, and you will have been long [ venoshantem ] | Gittin 88a:15 | <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which this opinion is derived? It is the verse: <b>“When you will beget children, and children’s children, and you will have been long [<i>venoshantem</i>]</b> in the land” (Deuteronomy 4:25). Since the word <i>venoshantem</i> stems from the word <i>yashan</i>, meaning old, it is derived that after one’s grandchildren, or three generations, a matter is considered old and forgotten. |
| Deuteronomy 4:32 | “For ask now of the days past, | Chagigah 11b:21 | § It is taught in the Mishnah: <b>“Nor</b> the <b>act of Creation before two. ”</b> The Talmud poses a question: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud explains: <b>As A baraita states</b> that the verse states: <b>“For ask now of the days past, </b> which were before you” (Deuteronomy 4:32); since this verse is stated in the singular, it teaches that <b>an individual may ask</b> questions with regard to Creation, i.e., “the days past,” <b>but two may not ask, </b> which indicates that one may teach such matters to only one student. |
| Deuteronomy 4:32 | verse states: “From one end of the heavens to the other” | Chagigah 11b:24 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may ask</b> questions with regard to <b>what is above, what is below, what was before, </b> and <b>what is after</b> the world. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “From one end of the heavens to the other”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:32), which is explained as follows: <b>With regard to that</b> which is <b>from one end of the heavens to the other, </b> within the boundaries of the world, <b>you may ask, but you may not ask what is above, what is below, what was before, </b> or <b>what is after. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:32 | from the ground to the skies, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, | Chagigah 12a:2 | The Talmud answers that this phrase teaches us something else, <b>according to R' Elazar. </b> As <b>R' Elazar said: </b> The height of <b>Adam the first man</b> reached <b>from the ground to the skies, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, </b> and from one end of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:32). <b>When he sinned, God placed His hand upon him and diminished him, as it is stated: “You fashioned me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me”</b> (Psalms 139:5). |
| Deuteronomy 4:32 | from one end of the world until the other, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other” | Sanhedrin 38b:7 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Adam the first</b> man spanned <b>from one end of the world until the other, as it is stated: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:32), meaning that on the day Adam was created he spanned from one end of the heavens until the other. <b>Once</b> Adam <b>sinned, God placed His hand on him and diminished him, as it is stated: “Behind and before You have created me and laid Your hand upon me”</b> (Psalms 139:5), that at first Adam spanned “behind and before,” meaning everywhere, and then God laid His hand on him and diminished him. |
| Deuteronomy 4:34 | “Or has God attempted | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation, </b> to whom God is close, like YHWH our God whenever we call upon Him? ” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation, </b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today? ” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel, </b> who is like you? A people saved by YHWH, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to YHWH, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 4:34 | “Or has God ventured | Megillah 11a:9 | <b>Rav Mattana said</b> his introduction <b>from here: “For what nation is there so great, that has God so near to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), as to witness the great miracles in the days of Mordecai and Esther? <b>Rav Ashi said</b> his introduction <b>from here: </b> The verse states: <b>“Or has God ventured</b> to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation? ” (Deuteronomy 4:34), as in the times of Esther, God saved the Jewish people who were scattered throughout the Persian Empire. |
| Deuteronomy 4:35 | “There is none else beside Him” | Chullin 7b:14 | The Talmud relates other statements of R' Ḥanina: With regard to the verse: <b>“There is none else beside Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35), <b>R' Ḥanina says: And even sorcery</b> is ineffective against the will of God. The Talmud relates: There was <b>a certain woman who would try to take dust from beneath the feet of R' Ḥanina</b> in order to perform sorcery on him and harm him. R' Ḥanina <b>said to her: Take</b> the dust, but <b>the matter will be ineffective for you, </b> as it <b>is written: “There is none other beside Him. ”</b> The Talmud asks: <b>But doesn’t R' Yoḥanan say: Why</b> is sorcery <b>called <i>keshafim</i>? </b> It is an acronym for <b><i>makhḥishin pamalya shel mala</i>, </b> meaning: <b>That they diminish the heavenly entourage [<i>pamalya</i>], </b> indicating that they function contrary to the will of God. The Talmud answers: <b>R' Ḥanina is different, as, </b> because <b>his merit is great, </b> sorcery has no effect on him. |
| Deuteronomy 4:35 | Kingship. “To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him” | Rosh Hashanah32b:17 | <b>“Know this day, and lay it to your heart, that YHWH, He is God</b> in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath; <b>there is none else”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:39), is a verse of <b>Kingship; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei. R' Yehuda says: </b> It is <b>not</b> a verse of <b>Kingship. “To you it was shown, that you might know that YHWH, He is God; there is none else beside Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35), is a verse of <b>Kingship; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei. R' Yehuda says: It is not</b> a verse of <b>Kingship. </b> This shows that according to the opinion of R' Yosei there are sufficient verses of Kingship in the Torah to recite three at the beginning and one at the end. |
| Deuteronomy 4:35 | there is none else besides Him” | Sanhedrin 67b:7 | The verse states: “To you it was shown, so that you should know that YHWH is God; <b>there is none else besides Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35). <b>R' Ḥanina says: </b> This is true <b>even</b> with regard <b>to a matter of sorcery; </b> sorcery is ineffective against a righteous person. |
| Deuteronomy 4:39 | it is written in the Torah: “Know therefore this today, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is no other” | Gittin 57b:17 | <b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol.

| Deuteronomy 4:41 | which is written: “Then Moses separated three cities beyond the Jordan, to the east of the sun [ mizreḥa shamesh ]” | Makkot 10a:15 | <b>R' Simlai taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Then Moses separated three cities beyond the Jordan, to the east of the sun [<i>mizreḥa shamesh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:41)? <b>God said to Moses: Shine the sun [<i>hazraḥ shemesh</i>] for murderers, </b> i.e., provide them with the hope of rescue. <b>Some say</b> that God <b>said to</b> Moses: In designating these cities of refuge <b>you have shined the sun for murderers. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:42 | he might live” | Gittin 12a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what is different</b> with regard to a slave who was exiled <b>to</b> one of the <b>cities of refuge, </b> concerning whom the <i>baraita</i> was stated? According to this reasoning, the surplus should belong to the master no matter where the slave is located. The Talmud answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the verse states with regard to one who is exiled to a city of refuge: “And that fleeing to one of these cities <b>he might live”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), one should <b>act for him</b> so that he has <b>extra life, </b> i.e., in this specific case the slave should be allowed to retain any additional amount he earns. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that no special obligation of this kind applies even if the slave had been exiled to a city of refuge. |
| Deuteronomy 4:42 | “And he shall flee to one of these cities and live” | Makkot 10a:9 | <b>R' Yitzḥak says: What is the verse</b> from which these matters are derived? It is written: <b>“And he shall flee to one of these cities and live”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), meaning: <b>Perform some</b> actions <b>for</b> the unintentional murderer so <b>that</b> life in the city of refuge <b>will be</b> conducive to <b>living for him. </b> All these steps are taken to facilitate that objective. |
| Deuteronomy 4:42 | is stated: “That the manslayer might flee there, who slays his neighbor without knowledge” | Sotah 49a:4 | <b>And R' Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says: </b> If there are <b>two Torah scholars who reside in the same city and they are not pleasant to each other with regard to <i>halakha</i>, </b> but are constantly fighting, <b>one</b> of them will <b>die and</b> the other <b>one</b> will be <b>exiled. As</b> it <b>is stated: “That the manslayer might flee there, who slays his neighbor without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), <b>and “knowledge”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”</b> (Hosea 4:6). |
| Deuteronomy 4:43 | Bezer | Avodah Zarah58b:8 | Reish Lakish <b>came before R' Yoḥanan</b> and told him about the incident. R' Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>While your coat [<i>addemiktorakh</i>]</b> is still <b>on you, go</b> and <b>retract</b> your rulings. This is because the town of <b>Bezer</b> which is mentioned among the cities of refuge (Deuteronomy 4:43) <b>is not</b> the same as <b>Bozrah. </b> Bozrah is not part of Eretz Yisrael, and one is not obligated to separate tithes from its produce. The water is also permitted as it is water that belongs to the public, <b>and water that belongs to</b> the <b>public is not rendered prohibited. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 4:43 | as it is stated: “Bezer in the wilderness, | Makkot 10a:11 | <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> In the case of <b>a teacher</b> of Torah <b>who was exiled, his school is exiled with him. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so</b> that a teacher of Torah is exiled? <b>But doesn’t R' Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that matters of Torah provide refuge, </b> i.e., that the blood redeemer may not harm one who is engaged in Torah?

Based on that juxtaposition it is derived that the status of Torah is like that of a city of refuge. |

| Deuteronomy 4:44 | sam | Yoma 72b:14 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And this is the Torah which Moses put</b> [<b><i>sam</i></b>] before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44)? The word <i>sam</i> is written with the letter <i>sin</i> and means put; it is phonetically similar to the word <i>sam</i> written with the letter <i>samekh</i>, meaning a drug. This use of this word therefore alludes to the following: If one <b>is deserving, </b> the Torah <b>becomes a potion [<i>sam</i>] of life for him. </b> If one <b>is not deserving, </b> the Torah <b>becomes a potion of death for him. And this</b> idea <b>is what Rava said: For one who is skillful</b> in his study of Torah and immerses himself in it with love, it is <b>a potion of life; </b> but <b>for one who is not skillful</b> in his studies, <b>it is a potion of death. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:1 | he does not even have Torah. What is the reason? Rav Pappa said: The verse states: That you may learn them and perform them, | Yevamot 109b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t</b> this <b>also obvious? </b> One does not receive more reward than he deserves. <b>Rather, </b> it means that <b>he does not even have Torah.

The verse teaches that <b>anyone who is engaged in performing</b> mitzvot <b>is engaged in</b> Torah <b>study, while anyone not engaged in performing</b> mitzvot <b>is not engaged in</b> Torah <b>study; </b> the Torah study of one who wishes only to immerse himself in his studies without fulfilling the mitzvot is not considered to be fulfilling even the mitzva of Torah study. |

Their dispute was: One <b>Master held: They were commanded</b> about <b>Shabbat, </b> but <b>they were not commanded</b> about Shabbat <b>boundaries. </b> Therefore, it was permitted to travel from Refidim on Shabbat, because the restriction of Shabbat boundaries was not yet in effect. <b>And</b> one <b>Master held: They were also commanded</b> about the <b>boundaries, </b> and therefore, it was prohibited to leave Refidim on Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 5:12 | “Observe | Berakhot 20b:10 | <b>Rather, Rava said: </b> This has a unique explanation. In the Ten Commandments in the book of Exodus, <b>the verse said: “Remember</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Exodus 20:8), while in the book of Deuteronomy it is said: <b>“Observe</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Deuteronomy 5:12). From these two variants we can deduce that <b>anyone included in</b> the obligation to <b>observe</b> Shabbat by avoiding its desecration, <b>is</b> also <b>included in</b> the mitzva to <b>remember</b> Shabbat by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>Since these women are included in</b> the mitzva <b>to observe</b> Shabbat, as there is no distinction between men and women in the obligation to observe prohibitions in general and to refrain from the desecration of Shabbat in particular, so too <b>are they included in</b> the mitzva of <b>remembering</b> Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 5:12 | “Keep | Rosh Hashanah27a:2 | § It was taught in the Mishnah: <b>And</b> there were <b>two trumpets, </b> one <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> of the person sounding the <i>shofar</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>But is it</b> really <b>possible to</b> properly <b>discern two</b> different <b>sounds, </b> that of the <i>shofar</i> and that of the trumpets, at the same time? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The two versions of the 5th of the Ten Commandments, <b>“Remember</b> the Shabbat day” (Exodus 20:8) and <b>“Keep</b> the Shabbat day” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken</b> by God simultaneously <b>in a single utterance, something that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot speak and the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear? </b> This indicates that it is impossible to take in two sounds at once, and so, due to the sound of the trumpets, it should be impossible to hear the blast of the <i>shofar</i>. The Talmud answers: <b>For this reason</b> they <b>would sound a long</b> blast <b>with the <i>shofar</i>, </b> to make it possible to hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i> on its own. |
| Deuteronomy 5:12 | as the Lord your God commanded you” | Sanhedrin 56b:16 | The mitzva of <b>judgment</b> was given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Marah: <b>“There He made for them a statute and an ordinance”</b> (Exodus 15:25). <b>Shabbat and honoring</b> one’s <b>father and mother</b> were given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> concerning them in the Ten Commandments: “Observe the day of Shabbat to keep it holy, <b>as YHWH your God commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:12), and similarly: “Honor your father and your mother, as YHWH your God commanded you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). The phrase “as YHWH your God commanded you” indicates that they had already been commanded to observe these mitzvot previously. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: “As</b> YHWH your God <b>commanded you” in Marah. </b> Apparently, the mitzva of establishing courts is not included in the seven Noahide mitzvot. |
| Deuteronomy 5:12 | corresponding to: “Observe | Shabbat 33b:8 | <b>As the sun was setting on Shabbat eve, they saw an elderly man who was holding two bundles of myrtle branches and running at twilight. They said to him: Why do you have these? He said to them: In honor of Shabbat. </b> They said to him: <b>And let one suffice. </b> He answered them: <b>One</b> is <b>corresponding to: “Remember</b> the Shabbat day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and</b> one is <b>corresponding to: “Observe</b> the Shabbat day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12). R' Shimon <b>said to his son: See how beloved the mitzvot are to Israel. Their minds were</b> put <b>at ease</b> and they were no longer as upset that people were not engaged in Torah study. |
| Deuteronomy 5:12 | and: “Observe | Shevuot 20b:9 | The Talmud answers: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case, of a false oath, is <b>as it is and that</b> case, of an oath taken in vain, is <b>as it is. What, </b> then, is the meaning of the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are one? </b> It is <b>that</b> both <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> at the giving of the Torah, <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remember</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and: “Observe</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken in one utterance, </b> in a manner <b>that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot say and that the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:13 | Shabbat, | Bava Kamma67b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>But why</b> is the fourfold and fivefold payment limited to oxen and sheep? <b>Let us derive</b> otherwise by a verbal analogy of the term <b>“ox”</b> in this verse and <b>“ox” from</b> a passage dealing with <b>Shabbat, </b> where it is stated: “And the 7th day is Sabbath to YHWH your God, you shall not perform any labor, you, your son, and your daughter, and your slave, and your female slave, and your ox, and your donkey, and all your animals, and the non-Jew that is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 5:13). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to Shabbat, the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to an ox is not limited to oxen, as <b>undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to</b> oxen in that they too are included in this prohibition, as the verse states: “Nor any of your animals,” <b>so too here, </b> in the case of theft, one can say that <b>undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to</b> oxen in that the fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred for their theft. |
| Deuteronomy 5:13 | so that your slave and your maidservant may rest like you” | Yevamot 48b:5 | The Talmud notes: <b>In any event, </b> in the opinion <b>of everyone</b> the verse: <b>“And the son of your female slave will be refreshed, ” is written with regard to an uncircumcised slave. From where</b> is this <b>inferred? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the son of your female slave will be refreshed”; the verse speaks of an uncircumcised slave. </b> Do <b>you say</b> it speaks <b>of an uncircumcised slave, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> speaking <b>only of a circumcised slave? When it says</b> elsewhere: “And the 7th day is a Shabbat to YHWH your God, you shall not do any labor, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your slave, and your female slave…<b>so that your slave and your female slave may rest like you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:13), <b>a circumcised slave is</b> already <b>mentioned; how, </b> then, <b>do I uphold</b> the verse <b>“And the son of your female slave will be refreshed”? </b> It must refer <b>to an uncircumcised slave. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:13 | “And your stranger [ ger ] that is within your gates” | Yevamot 48b:6 | The verse continues: <b>“And the stranger [<i>ger</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:12). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>a non-Jew who observes certain mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>]. </b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>this is a <i>ger toshav</i>, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only a righteous convert [<i>ger tzedek</i>], </b> who is a Jew in every sense? <b>When it says</b> elsewhere: <b>“And your stranger [<i>ger</i>] that is within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:13), <b>a righteous convert is</b> already <b>mentioned. How, </b> then, <b>do I uphold</b> the verse <b>“And the stranger [<i>ger</i>]”? </b> It must be that <b>this is a <i>ger toshav</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:14 | is stated: “Nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle” | Bava Kamma54b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>concerning Shabbat</b> itself that the words “ox” and “donkey” are referring to all types of animals? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says in the name of R' Yishmael: In the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Your manservant, your female slave, nor your cattle”</b> (Exodus 20:10), whereas <b>in the second</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:14). Now, <b>aren’t an ox and a donkey</b> already <b>included in</b> the category of: <b>All animals, </b> which are included in the term “cattle”? <b>Why, </b> then, were they <b>specified? To teach you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>ox and donkey that are stated here, undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them, so too, </b> everywhere that an ox and donkey are mentioned, <b>all</b> types of <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:14 | that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you” | Bava Kamma54b:28 | <b>Rav Pappa said: </b> The rabbis of <b>Paphunya know the reason for this matter, and who</b> are these rabbis? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, </b> who resided in Paphunya. The reason is that the <b>verse states: </b> “You shall not perform any labor, neither you, your son, your daughter, your slave, your female slave, your ox, your donkey, any of your animals, or the stranger residing within your city gates, <b>that your manservant and your female slave may rest as well as you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:14), as if to say: <b>I have equated</b> people with animals only <b>concerning resting</b> on Shabbat, <b>but not with regard to another matter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:14 | with regard to Shabbat. | Bava Metzia89a:1 | <b>Now, </b> consider: <b>All matters, </b> i.e., all animals, <b>are</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>muzzling, as we derive</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“an ox”</b> stated here and the term <b>“an ox”</b> stated <b>with regard to Shabbat. </b> Just as the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat applies not only to oxen but to all animals, as explicitly stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 5:14), so too the <i>halakha</i> of muzzling includes all animals, not merely oxen. <b>If so, </b> and the term “ox” in this verse does not limit the <i>halakha</i> to that animal alone, <b>let God write</b> in general terms: <b>You shall not thresh while muzzling; why do I need</b> the word <b>“ox” that God writes? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | good is stated there: | Bava Kamma55a:1 | in the context of the mitzva to honor one’s parents, the word <b>good is stated there: </b> “In order that it shall be good for you” (Deuteronomy 5:16)? R' Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: Before you ask me why</b> the word <b>good is stated, ask me if</b> the word <b>good is</b> actually <b>stated there or not, since</b> I am not sufficiently proficient in my knowledge of the biblical verses to remember the precise wording, and <b>I do not know if</b> the word <b>good is stated there or not. Go to R' Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai, who was</b> commonly <b>found at</b> the academy of <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi, who was an expert in <i>aggada</i>. </b> Perhaps he heard something from him on this matter and can answer your question. |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | it | Chullin 110b:3 | Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to them: Leave him</b> alone, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>any positive mitzva whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it</b> in the Torah, <b>the</b> earthly <b>court below is not warned to</b> enforce <b>it</b> through punishments such as flogging. And it is stated after the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother: “That your days may be long, and that it go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Tamrei: <b>I see that you are very sharp. </b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>If you were in the place where Rav Yehuda</b> resides, <b>I would</b> be able to <b>show you my sharpness</b> of mind far better than here. |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you” | Chullin 142a:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>The school of R' Ya’akov taught that</b> R' Ya’akov <b>says: There is not a single mitzva</b> written <b>in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on</b> a belief in <b>the resurrection of the dead, </b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest, it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | verse: | Chullin 142a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Had Aḥer, </b> literally Other, the appellation of the former Sage Elisha ben Avuya, <b>interpreted homiletically this</b> aforementioned <b>verse: </b> “That it may go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16), as referring to the World-to-Come, <b>as</b> did <b>R' Ya’akov, the son of his daughter, </b> he would <b>not have sinned. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What did</b> Aḥer <b>see</b> that led him to heresy? <b>Some say</b> that <b>he saw an incident like this</b> one witnessed by R' Ya’akov, <b>and some say</b> that <b>he saw the tongue of R' Ḥutzpit the disseminator, which was cast in a garbage dump</b> after he was executed by the government. Aḥer <b>said: Will a mouth that produced pearls</b> of wisdom <b>lick the dust? But he did not know</b> that the phrase <b>“that it may be well with you”</b> means <b>in the world where all is well, </b> and that the phrase <b>“that your days may be long”</b> is referring <b>to the world that is entirely long. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | verse: | Kiddushin 39b:13 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Had Aḥer, </b> literally Other, the appellation of the former Sage Elisha ben Avuya, <b>interpreted this</b> aforementioned <b>verse: </b> “That it may go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16), <b>homiletically, </b> as referring to the World-to-Come, <b>as</b> did <b>R' Ya’akov, son of his daughter, </b> he would <b>not have sinned. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And what</b> caused <b>Aḥer</b> to sin? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say he saw a case like this, </b> where a son went up to the roof on his father’s command, dispatched the mother bird, and then died. It was witnessing this episode that led Elisha ben Avuya astray. |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | With regard to honoring one’s father and mother it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you” | Kiddushin 39b:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Ya’akov says: There is not a single mitzva written in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on the resurrection of the dead, </b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). |
| Deuteronomy 5:16 | With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you” | Kiddushin 40a:5 | Rava cites the source for each of these assertions. <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16), which indicates that one is rewarded in this world. <b>With regard to acts of loving kindness it is written: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness shall find life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), all of which apply in this world. |
| Deuteronomy 5:18 | with a great voice and it went on no more [ velo yasaf ]” | Sotah 10b:12 | The same verse continues: <b>“And he knew her [<i>leda’atah</i>] again no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>], ”</b> seemingly indicating that Judah did not have sex with Tamar again. <b>Shmuel the Elder, father-in-law of Rav Shmuel bar Ami, says in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Ami: </b> The verse actually means that <b>once he knew</b> of <b>her</b> that her intentions were for the sake of Heaven, <b>he did not desist from</b> having sex with <b>her again, </b> as <b>it is written here: “<i>Velo yasaf od leda’atah</i>, ” and it is written there</b> at the giving of the Torah: “These words YHWH spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, <b>with a great voice and it went on no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:18), which is interpreted to mean: A great voice that did not cease. |
| Deuteronomy 5:19 | a great voice, and it went on no more [ velo yasaf ]” | Sanhedrin 17a:12 | <b>The Master says: </b> The <i>baraita</i> said: <b>All of the prophets prophesied and</b> then <b>stopped, but</b> Eldad and Medad <b>prophesied and did not stop. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the other prophets <b>stopped</b> prophesying? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>from that which is written</b> about them: <b>“And they prophesied but they did so no more [<i>velo yasafu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 11:25), that is difficult: <b>But if that is so, </b> then concerning that which is stated in relation to the giving of the Torah: “These words YHWH spoke to all your assembly…with <b>a great voice, and it went on no more [<i>velo yasaf</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:19), <b>so too</b> shall it be understood <b>that</b> the great voice <b>did not continue? Rather, </b> the intention there is <b>that it did not stop, </b> interpreting the word <i>yasafu</i> as related to <i>sof</i>, meaning: End. Consequently, with regard to the seventy Elders as well, the word can be interpreted to mean that they did not stop prophesying. |
| Deuteronomy 5:25 | forever” | Avodah Zarah4b:19 | <b>And</b> likewise <b>the Jewish people were not fit to</b> act as they did in <b>that incident</b> of the Golden Calf, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the Jewish people of that time: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this always, to fear Me</b> and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children <b>forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:25). <b>Rather, why did they perform</b> these sins? |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | forever” | Avodah Zarah4b:17 | <b>And R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: The Jewish people fashioned the</b> Golden <b>Calf</b> (see Exodus, chapter 32) <b>only to give a claim to penitents, as it is stated</b> after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this always, to fear Me, </b> and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children <b>forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26). If the nation was truly at such a lofty spiritual state, how could they worship the Golden Calf? Rather, their sin occurred so that it would be made clear that one can repent for any sin, as even a sin as severe as the Golden Calf was forgiven. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | “Who would give that they had such a heart as this always, | Avodah Zarah5a:13 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the new formulation of Reish Lakish’s statement, according to which the Jewish people would have become immortal had they not sinned with the Golden Calf. The verse states about the Jewish people after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this always, </b> to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26). The <i>baraita</i> states that although they had reached such an elevated state, it <b>was not possible to nullify</b> the power of <b>the Angel of Death over them, as the decree</b> of death <b>was already issued</b> from the time of creation. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | “Who would give that they had such a heart as this | Avodah Zarah5a:21 | § The Talmud returns to a verse cited above. <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this</b> always, to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26). At a later stage, <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: Ingrates, children of ingrates! When God said to the Jewish people: “Who would give that they had such a heart as this always, ” they should have said: You should give</b> us a heart to fear You. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | But isn’t it written: “That it might be good for them, and with their children | Avodah Zarah5a:8 | The Talmud further asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “That it might be good for them, and with their children</b> forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26), which indicates that they would continue to bear children? The Talmud answers: This verse is referring <b>to those</b> children <b>who stood</b> with them <b>at Mount Sinai, </b> not to future generations. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | “Go, say to them: Return to your tents” | Beitzah 5a:7 | <b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As it is written, </b> after the Jews received the Torah: <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), where “your tents” is referring to your wives. <b>And it says, </b> before the revelation at Sinai: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). And it is stated: “Be ready for the 3rd day, do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). In other words, although the original prohibition served a particular purpose, in this case the giving of the Torah, it was nevertheless necessary to explicitly render the prohibition permitted. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | “Go, say to them: Return to your tents” | Beitzah 5b:3 | The Talmud seeks to clarify why Rav Yosef cited two verses as proof. The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for: <b>And it says? </b> Why does Rav Yosef find it necessary to quote a second verse? The Talmud explains that <b>this is</b> what he <b>is saying. Now since it is written: “Be ready for the 3rd day, do not come near a woman”</b> (Exodus 19:15), <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26)? After three days the prohibition would lapse in any case. <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>any matter</b> established by <b>a vote requires another vote to permit it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | requires another vote to permit it. | Sanhedrin 59b:4 | The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse stated at Sinai is not necessary for the mitzva itself, but rather <b>it comes to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>: <b>That any matter that</b> was prohibited <b>by</b> an official <b>vote</b> of the Sanhedrin <b>requires another vote to permit it. </b> Even if a rabbinic prohibition is no longer relevant, it is not automatically canceled, but rather a special ruling is required to cancel it. This is derived from the fact that it was necessary for God to issue a declaration (Deuteronomy 5:26) specifically canceling the prohibition that had been issued before the giving of the Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 5:26 | “Go say to them: Return to your tents” | Shabbat 87a:4 | <b>And he</b> totally <b>separated from</b> his <b>wife</b> after the revelation at Sinai. <b>What</b> source <b>did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? <b>He reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i> inference by himself</b> and <b>said: If Israel, with whom the Shekhina spoke only one time and</b> God <b>set a</b> specific <b>time for them</b> when the Shekhina would be revealed, and yet <b>the Torah stated: “Prepare yourselves</b> for three days, <b>do not approach</b> a woman” (Exodus 19:15); <b>I, with whom the Shekhina speaks all the time and</b> God <b>does not set a</b> specific <b>time for me, all the more so</b> that I must separate from my wife. <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>God agreed with him? As it is written</b> after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), meaning to your homes and wives. <b>And afterward it is written</b> that God told Moses: <b>“And you, stand here with Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), indicating that Moses was not allowed to return home, as he must constantly be prepared to receive the word of God. <b>And some say</b> a different source indicating that God agreed with his reasoning. When Aaron and Miriam criticized Moses’ separation from his wife, God said: <b>“With him do I speak mouth to mouth, </b> even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of YHWH does he behold; why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses? ” (Numbers 12:8). This indicates that God agreed with his reasoning. |
| Deuteronomy 5:27 | at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents” | Avodah Zarah5a:7 | The Talmud asks: Is this <b>to say that if they had not sinned</b> with the Golden Calf <b>they would not have sired</b> children? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Noah and his children were instructed: <b>“And you, be fruitful, and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7)? The Talmud answers: This instruction was issued only <b>until</b> the revelation at <b>Sinai, </b> but the Jewish people would have become like angels there, had they not sinned. The Talmud asks: Isn’t it <b>also written</b> about the Jewish people who were at the revelation <b>at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), which means that they were instructed to resume marital sex? The Talmud answers: That verse is referring <b>to the enjoyment of conjugal rights, </b> not to procreation. |
| Deuteronomy 5:27 | Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [ po ] with me” | Bava Batra110a:3 | In connection with the Talmud’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Talmud quotes additional statements of the rabbis concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <b>“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who brought you here [<i>halom</i>], and what [<i>ma</i>] are you doing in this place, and what do you have here [<i>po</i>]? ”</b> (Judges 18:3). The rabbis interpret their multiple questions. <b>They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [<i>halom</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:5)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [<i>ma</i>] is that in your hand”</b> (Exodus 4:2)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [<i>po</i>] with me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27)? <b>Shall you, </b> a descendant of our teacher Moses, <b>become a priest for idol worship? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:27 | “Go say to them, return again to your tents” | Moed Katan15b:13 | The Talmud continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a metzora</b> with regard to <b>sexual sex? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning a metzora states: <b>“But he shall remain outside his tent</b> seven days” (Leviticus 14:8), from which it is derived <b>that</b> a metzora <b>should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in sexual sex. </b> How is this derived? The <b>only</b> meaning of the term <b>“his tent”</b> is <b>his wife, as is stated</b> after the giving of the Torah: <b>“Go say to them, return again to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27). This statement rendered it permitted for the men to once again have sex with their wives after they had previously been prohibited to do so in anticipation of the giving of the Torah, as expressed in the verse: “Come not near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). The Talmud concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is prohibited for a metzora to have sex. |
| Deuteronomy 5:27 | “Go say to them: Return to your tents” | Sanhedrin 59b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>procreation, which was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah? As it is written: “And you, be fruitful and multiply, </b> swarm in the land and multiply in it” (Genesis 9:7). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai, </b> in the verse: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), when the Jewish men were commanded to resume sex with their wives after having been commanded to separate from them in preparation for the giving of the Torah. Nevertheless, the mitzva of procreation <b>was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 5:27 | “And you, stand here with Me” | Shabbat 87a:4 | <b>And he</b> totally <b>separated from</b> his <b>wife</b> after the revelation at Sinai. <b>What</b> source <b>did he interpret</b> that led him to do so? <b>He reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i> inference by himself</b> and <b>said: If Israel, with whom the Shekhina spoke only one time and</b> God <b>set a</b> specific <b>time for them</b> when the Shekhina would be revealed, and yet <b>the Torah stated: “Prepare yourselves</b> for three days, <b>do not approach</b> a woman” (Exodus 19:15); <b>I, with whom the Shekhina speaks all the time and</b> God <b>does not set a</b> specific <b>time for me, all the more so</b> that I must separate from my wife. <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>God agreed with him? As it is written</b> after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), meaning to your homes and wives. <b>And afterward it is written</b> that God told Moses: <b>“And you, stand here with Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), indicating that Moses was not allowed to return home, as he must constantly be prepared to receive the word of God. <b>And some say</b> a different source indicating that God agreed with his reasoning. When Aaron and Miriam criticized Moses’ separation from his wife, God said: <b>“With him do I speak mouth to mouth, </b> even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of YHWH does he behold; why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses? ” (Numbers 12:8). This indicates that God agreed with his reasoning. |
| Deuteronomy 5:28 | as the verse states: “But as for you, stand here with Me, | Megillah 21a:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> We learned in the Mishnah that one may read the Megilla while sitting. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <b>is not the case with regard to</b> reading <b>the Torah, </b> as one must stand when reading the Torah. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Abbahu said: </b> It is <b>as the verse states: “But as for you, stand here with Me, </b> and I will speak to you all the commandments and the statutes” (Deuteronomy 5:28), which indicates that the Torah must be received while standing. <b>And R' Abbahu said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it would be impossible to utter it, </b> in deference to God. The phrase “with Me” indicates that, <b>as it were, even God was standing</b> at the giving of the Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 6:1 | from all mitzvot that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “And this is the commandment, statutes, and laws” | Bava Kamma87a:2 | The Talmud presents another statement of R' Yehuda. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: A blind person does not have, </b> i.e., receive, compensation for <b>humiliation, and so did R' Yehuda exempt</b> a blind person <b>from all mitzvot that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of R' Yehuda?

| Deuteronomy 6:1 | the mitzva” | Nedarim 38a:1 | The same is true for <b>“this” that</b> is in the verse “and this is <b>the mitzva”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:1); and for <b>“bend” that</b> is in the verse “let <b>the archer</b> bend his bow” (Jeremiah 51:3); and for <b>“five” that</b> is in the verse “and <b>the south side</b> four thousand and five hundred” (Ezekiel 48:16); and for <b>“if” that</b> is in the verse <b>“that</b> if I am <b>a near kinsman”</b> (Ruth 3:12).

| Deuteronomy 6:4 | as it is stated: “Hear, | Berakhot 13a:27 | The Talmud seeks to clarify further: <b>And what is the reason for the Rabbis’</b> opinion? The Talmud answers: The source upon which the Rabbis base their opinion is, <b>as it is stated: “Hear, </b> Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which they understand to mean that <i>Shema</i> must be understood. Therefore, one may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in any language that you</b> can <b>hear</b> and understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | “Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One” | Berakhot 6a:22 | <b>You have made Me a single entity in the world, as it is stated</b> that Israel declares God’s oneness by saying: <b>“Hear, Israel, YHWH is our God, YHWH is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> because of this, <b>I will make you a single entity in the world, </b> unique and elevated with the utterance: <b>“Who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land? ”</b> Consequently, God is glorified through the glory of Israel whose praises are written in God’s tefillin. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | You have made Me a single entity in the world, as it is written: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One” | Chagigah 3a:19 | R' Elazar explained: <b>God said to the Jewish people: You have made Me a single entity in the world, </b> as you singled Me out as separate and unique. <b>And</b> therefore <b>I will make you a single entity in the world, </b> as you will be a treasured nation, chosen by God. <b>You have made Me a single entity in the world, as it is written: “Hear, O Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> therefore <b>I will make you a single entity in the world, as it is stated: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | after two words, as it is stated: “Hear, Israel: The Lord | Chullin 91b:16 | <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the Jewish people mention the name</b> of God <b>after two words, as it is stated: “Hear, Israel: YHWH</b> our God, YHWH is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>But the ministering angels mention the name</b> of God <b>only after three words, as it is written: </b> “And one called unto another, and said: <b>“Holy, holy, holy is YHWH of hosts; </b> the whole earth is full of His glory” (Isaiah 6:3). |

| Deuteronomy 6:4 | The verse states: “Hear, | Megillah 17b:1 | <b>“And</b> these words…<b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), teaching that these words, the words of the <i>Shema</i>, always <b>“shall be” as they are, </b> i.e., in the Hebrew language. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the rabbis, what is the reason</b> for their opinion? <b>The verse states: “Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which could also be translated, “Understand, O Israel,” indicating that you may recite these words <b>in any language that you hear, </b> i.e., understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites the Shema must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God; the Lord is One” | Megillah 20a:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda said in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites the <i>Shema</i> must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear O Israel, YHWH our God; YHWH is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), the word “hear” indicating that you should <b>allow your ears to hear</b> the words <b>you are expressing with your mouth.

We see that according to R' Elazar ben Azarya, as cited by R' Yehuda, the words must be audible to one’s ears <i>ab initio</i>. |

| Deuteronomy 6:4 | they recited: “Hear Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is One | Pesachim 56a:5 | We learned in the Mishnah that the residents of Jericho would <b>bundle <i>Shema</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: What does it mean that they bundled <i>Shema</i>? <b>How did they do</b> so? <b>R' Yehuda said</b> that <b>they recited: “Hear Israel: YHWH is our God, YHWH is One</b>” (Deuteronomy 6:4), <b>and they would not pause</b> between words. <b>Rava said: They</b> would <b>pause</b> between words, <b>but</b> instead of reciting this verse in the proper manner: “That which I command you today, shall be on your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:5), pausing after the word today; <b>they would say: Today shall be on your heart, </b> inferring: <b>Today it will be on your heart, and tomorrow it will not be on your heart.

| Deuteronomy 6:4 | As it is written: “Hear, O Israel” | Sotah 32b:18 | § The Talmud continues its discussion of the recitations that can be stated in any language. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>Shema</i></b> may be recited in any language? <b>As it is written: “Hear, O Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), which is homiletically interpreted to mean that it can be recited <b>in any language that you</b> can <b>hear</b> and understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | The verse states: “Hear, | Sotah 32b:21 | The Talmud asks further: <b>And</b> what is the reason for <b>the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which they explain to mean that <i>Shema</i> must be understood. Therefore, one may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in any language that you</b> can <b>hear</b> and understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:4 | “Hear, | Sotah 41a:18 | <b>And</b> the king <b>reads from the beginning of</b> Deuteronomy, from the verse that states: <b>“And these are the words”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1), <b>until</b> the words: <b>“Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> he then reads the sections beginning with: <b>“Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), <b>“You shall tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22–29), <b>“When you have made an end of the tithing”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12–15), <b>and the passage concerning the</b> appointment of <b>a king</b> (Deuteronomy 17:14–20), <b>and the blessings and curses</b> (Deuteronomy 28), <b>until he finishes the entire portion. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | as it is stated: “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, | Berakhot 54a:6 | The Mishnah articulates a general principle: <b>One is obligated to recite a blessing for the bad</b> that befalls him <b>just as he recites a blessing for the good</b> that befalls him, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall love YHWH your God with all your heart, </b> with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5). The Mishnah explains this verse as follows: “<b>With all your heart”</b> means <b>with your two inclinations, with your good inclination and your evil inclination, </b> both of which must be subjugated to the love of God. <b>“With all your soul”</b> means <b>even if God takes your soul. “And with all your might”</b> means <b>with all your money, </b> as money is referred to in the Bible as might. <b>Alternatively, </b> it may be explained that “<b>with all your might”</b> means <b>with every measure that He metes out to you; </b> whether it is good or troublesome, <b>thank Him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | “And you shall love the Lord your God | Berakhot 61b:5 | We learned in our Mishnah the explanation of the verse: <b>“And you shall love YHWH your God</b> with all your heart and all your soul and all your might” (Deuteronomy 6:5). This was elaborated upon when <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer says: If it is stated: “With all your soul, ” why does it state: “With all your might”? </b> Conversely, <b>if it stated: “With all your might, ” why does it state: “With all your soul”? Rather, </b> this means that <b>if one’s body is dearer to him than his property, therefore it is stated: “With all your soul”; </b> one must give his soul in sanctification of God. <b>And if one’s money is dearer to him than his body, therefore it is stated: “With all your might”; </b> with all your assets. <b>R' Akiva says: “With all your soul”</b> means: <b>Even if</b> God <b>takes your soul. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | and with all your soul,” why is it stated: “And with all your might” | Pesachim 25a:11 | The Talmud answers: <b>Actually, </b> it is referring to a case where <b>there is danger, and even so, </b> one my <b>not</b> derive benefit from <b>the wood of an <i>asheira</i>. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: If it is stated: </b> “And you shall love YHWH your God with all your heart, <b>and with all your soul, ” why is it stated: “And with all your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5)? <b>And if it is stated: “With all your might, ” why is it stated: “With all your soul”? </b> One of these statements appears to be superfluous. |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | but | Pesachim 56a:5 | We learned in the Mishnah that the residents of Jericho would <b>bundle <i>Shema</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: What does it mean that they bundled <i>Shema</i>? <b>How did they do</b> so? <b>R' Yehuda said</b> that <b>they recited: “Hear Israel: YHWH is our God, YHWH is One</b>” (Deuteronomy 6:4), <b>and they would not pause</b> between words. <b>Rava said: They</b> would <b>pause</b> between words, <b>but</b> instead of reciting this verse in the proper manner: “That which I command you today, shall be on your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:5), pausing after the word today; <b>they would say: Today shall be on your heart, </b> inferring: <b>Today it will be on your heart, and tomorrow it will not be on your heart.

| Deuteronomy 6:5 | “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might” | Sanhedrin 74a:15 | The Talmud answers: <b>Those</b> in the upper story of the house of Nitza <b>stated</b> their opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> It is stated: <b>“And you shall love YHWH your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5). <b>If it is stated: “With all your soul, ” why is it</b> also <b>stated: “With all your might, ”</b> which indicates with all your material possessions? <b>And if it is stated: “With all your might, ” why is it</b> also <b>stated: “With all your soul”? </b> One of these clauses seems to be superfluous. |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | and with all your soul” | Yoma 82a:10 | The Talmud clarifies: With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition against <b>idol worship</b> takes precedence over saving one’s life, <b>from where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: If it is stated: </b> “And you shall love YHWH your God with all your heart, <b>and with all your soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5), <b>why is it stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And with all your might”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5)? <b>And if it is stated: “With all your might, ” why is it stated: “With all your soul”? </b> One of these statements appears to be superfluous. |
| Deuteronomy 6:5 | “And you shall love the Lord your God” | Yoma 86a:12 | <b>Abaye said: As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated: <b>“And you shall love YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:5), which means <b>that you shall make the name of Heaven beloved. </b> How should one do so? One should do so <b>in that he</b> should <b>read</b> Torah, <b>and learn</b> Mishnah, <b>and serve Torah scholars, and he should be pleasant with people in his business transactions.

| Deuteronomy 6:6 | will be | Berakhot 13a:26 | The Talmud seeks to clarify: <b>What is the reason for R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion? The Talmud answers: The source for his <i>halakha</i> lies in the emphasis on the word: <b>“And</b> these words, which I command you this day, <b>will be</b> upon your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6). “Will be” means <b>as they are, so shall they be; </b> they should remain unchanged, in their original language. |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | shall be” | Megillah 17b:1 | <b>“And</b> these words…<b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), teaching that these words, the words of the <i>Shema</i>, always <b>“shall be” as they are, </b> i.e., in the Hebrew language. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the rabbis, what is the reason</b> for their opinion? <b>The verse states: “Hear, </b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4), which could also be translated, “Understand, O Israel,” indicating that you may recite these words <b>in any language that you hear, </b> i.e., understand. |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | which I command you this day shall be in your heart” | Megillah 20a:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda said in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites the <i>Shema</i> must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear O Israel, YHWH our God; YHWH is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), the word “hear” indicating that you should <b>allow your ears to hear</b> the words <b>you are expressing with your mouth.

We see that according to R' Elazar ben Azarya, as cited by R' Yehuda, the words must be audible to one’s ears <i>ab initio</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | shall be” | Megillah 9a:5 | The Talmud asks: With regard to <b>tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i>, what is the reason</b> that they must be written in Hebrew? The Talmud explains: It is <b>because it is written with regard to them: “And</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that <b>as they are so shall they be, </b> without change. The Talmud raises a difficulty: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> Aramaic <b>translation that one wrote</b> in the Hebrew of the <b>Bible is there? Granted, </b> in the <b>Torah there is</b> a verse written in Aramaic translation: <b>“<i>Yegar sahaduta</i>”</b> (Genesis 31:47); <b>however, here, </b> in tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>what</b> verses in Aramaic <b>translation are there</b> that could be written in Hebrew? |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | shall be” | Megillah 9a:9 | The Talmud asks: How did our Rabbis permit this? <b>Isn’t it written</b> with regard to tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i>: <b>“And</b> these words <b>shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that their language may not be changed. <b>Rather, say</b> that this is what the <i>baraita</i> is saying: Torah <b>scrolls are written in any language; and our Rabbis permitted</b> writing them <b>in Greek</b> as well. Once again the Talmud asks: Our Rabbis <b>permitted? By inference, </b> apparently <b>the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits</b> writing a Torah scroll in Greek. However, he explicitly permits writing a Torah scroll in any language. |
| Deuteronomy 6:6 | will be | Sotah 32b:20 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>The verse states: “And</b> these words, which I command you this day, <b>will be</b> upon your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6). “Will be” means <b>as they are, so shall they be. </b> They should remain unchanged, in their original language. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | when you lie down and when you rise” | Berakhot 21a:8 | <b>Rav Yosef raises an objection: </b> How can you say that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> is only by rabbinic law when it is explicitly written: “And you shall recite them to your children and speak of them when you sit in your home and when you walk by the way, <b>when you lie down and when you rise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7)? <b>Abaye said to him: That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to matters of Torah. </b> One need not interpret the verse in the conventional manner, as obligating the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but rather as referring to the general obligation to study Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | when you lie down, and when you arise” | Berakhot 2a:8 | The Talmud offers a single response to both questions: <b>The <i>tanna</i> bases himself on the verse as it is written: </b> “You will talk of them when you sit in your home, and when you walk along the way, <b>when you lie down, and when you arise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). By teaching the laws of the evening <i>Shema</i> first, the <i>tanna</i> has established that the teachings of the Oral Torah correspond to that which is taught in the Written Torah. <b>And</b> based on the Written Torah, <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> the oral law: <b>When is the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> of lying down</b> as commanded in the Torah? <b>From when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>. </b> Just as the Written Torah begins with the evening <i>Shema</i>, so too must the Oral Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | “And you shall teach them diligently [ veshinnantam ]” | Kiddushin 30a:15 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall teach them diligently [<i>veshinnantam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). The root <i>shin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>nun</i>, of <i>veshinnantam</i> should be understood as meaning sharp, i.e., <b>that matters of Torah should be sharp</b> and clear <b>in your mouth, </b> so <b>that if a person asks you something, do not stutter</b> in uncertainty <b>and say</b> an uncertain response <b>to him. Rather, answer him immediately, as it is stated: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | which is written: “And you shall teach them diligently [ veshinnantam ] to your sons” | Kiddushin 30a:9 | § <b>Rav Safra says in the name of R' Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And you shall teach them diligently [<i>veshinnantam</i>] to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7)? <b>Do not read</b> this as <b>“<i>veshinnantam</i>, ”</b> with the root <i>shin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>nun</i>, which indicates a repetition. <b>Rather, </b> read it as <b><i>veshillashtam</i>, </b> with the root <i>shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>shin</i>, related to the word three, <i>shalosh</i>. This means that one must study, review, and study again, thereby dividing one’s studies into three parts. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | Torah study | Kiddushin 34a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But is</b> this an established <b>principle? </b> But <b>there are</b> the mitzvot of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> on the first night of Passover (Exodus 23:15), of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival (Deuteronomy 16:9–11), and <b>assembly</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). <b>And</b> each of these is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are obligated</b> in them. <b>And furthermore, </b> one can raise a difficulty as follows: <b>But there are</b> the mitzvot of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7), <b>procreation</b> (Genesis 1:28), <b>and redemption of the firstborn</b> (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which <b>is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are exempt</b> from them. |
| Deuteronomy 6:7 | The Sages taught | Sukkah 25a:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived that one who is performing a mitzva is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>? <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written in the Torah that one recites <i>Shema</i> at the following times: “When you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up” (Deuteronomy 6:7). The rabbis interpret: <b>“When you sit in your house, ” to the exclusion of one who is engaged in</b> the performance of <b>a mitzva, </b> who is not sitting at home; <b>“and when you walk by the way, ” to the exclusion of a groom, </b> who is preoccupied with his mitzva of consummating the marriage and is not walking along the way. The <i>baraita</i> adds that <b>from here</b> the rabbis <b>stated: One who marries a virgin is exempt</b> from reciting <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night, <b>and</b> one who marries <b>a widow is obligated. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | since it is written: “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” | Arakhin 3b:10 | § The Talmud cites another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>tefillin, </b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites. </b> The Talmud again asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? </b> The Talmud answers that <b>it was necessary</b> to say that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8), perhaps this juxtaposition teaches that <b>anyone included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the tefillin of the <b>arm</b> is also <b>included in</b> the <b>mitzva of</b> the tefillin of the <b>head. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | “And you shall bind them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | mezuza , | Berakhot 20b:4 | We also learned in the Mishnah that women are exempt <b>from tefillin. </b> The Talmud asks: That is <b>obvious</b> as well. The donning of tefillin is only in effect at particular times; during the day but not at night, on weekdays but not on Shabbat or Festivals. The Talmud replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> the mitzva of tefillin <b>is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>, </b> as it is written: “And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hands and they shall be frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), followed by: “And you shall write them upon the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9), just as women are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>, so too they are obligated in the mitzva of tefillin. Therefore, the Mishnah <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, women are exempt. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | The school of Menashe taught | Eruvin 95b:17 | The Talmud comments: <b>The school of Menashe taught</b> the following. The verse states: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8). <b>“On your arm, ” this is the biceps</b> muscle of the arm; <b>“between your eyes, ” this is the crown</b> of the head. The Talmud asks: <b>Where</b> exactly on the crown of the head? <b>The school of R' Yannai say: </b> tefillin are placed on <b>the spot where a baby’s head is soft</b> after birth. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | phylacteries | Kiddushin 34a:1 | <b>And</b> the donning of <b>tefillin</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8), which are not worn at night or on Shabbat and Festivals, is also a positive, time-bound mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | “And you shall bind them | Menachot 33a:8 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>raises</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>a handbreadth from the ground, or</b> one <b>distances</b> it <b>from the</b> cross <b>beam a handbreadth, and the entire entrance</b> between those two handbreadths is <b>fit for</b> the placement of the <b><i>mezuza</i>; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. R' Yosei says: </b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>Just as</b> the <b>binding</b> of the tefillin is performed <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the arm, <b>so too, </b> the <b>writing, </b> i.e., the placement, of a <i>mezuza</i> must be specifically <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the entrance. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | for totafot | Menachot 34b:1 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the tefillin of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18), this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a manner that must be plural. <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here, </b> as the 3rd one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the tefillin of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | “And you shall bind them [ ukshartam ] | Menachot 35b:2 | § The Talmud relates: <b>Abaye was sitting before Rav Yosef</b> when the <b>strap of his tefillin tore. </b> Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether one may <b>tie</b> the strap? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: It is written</b> with regard to tefillin: <b>“And you shall bind them [<i>ukshartam</i>]</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), which teaches <b>that</b> the <b>binding must be complete [<i>keshira tamma</i>], </b> whole and beautiful, and that would not be the case with a makeshift knot. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | “And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” | Menachot 36a:5 | It is further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one dons</b> tefillin, he first <b>dons</b> the tefillin <b>of the arm and afterward dons</b> the tefillin <b>of the head. And when he removes</b> his tefillin, he first <b>removes</b> the tefillin <b>of the head and afterward removes</b> the tefillin <b>of the arm. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, </b> the ruling that <b>when one dons</b> tefillin he first <b>dons</b> the tefillin <b>of the arm and afterward dons</b> the tefillin <b>of the head</b> is understood, <b>as it is</b> first <b>written: “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your arm, ” and then</b> it is written: <b>“And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8). |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | it says: “And you shall bind them | Menachot 37a:2 | <b>R' Natan says: </b> This proof is <b>not necessary, </b> as <b>it says: “And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). This teaches that <b>just as writing is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, as most people write with their right hands, <b>so too, </b> the <b>binding</b> of tefillin must be performed <b>with</b> the <b>right</b> hand. <b>And since binding is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, this means that <b>donning is on</b> the <b>left</b> arm, as one cannot bind the tefillin with the same hand upon which he is donning them. The Talmud asks: <b>And from where does R' Yosei HaḤorem, </b> who holds that the right hand is also called <i>yad</i> in the Torah, <b>derive that donning</b> tefillin is <b>on</b> the <b>left</b> arm? The Talmud answers: <b>He derives it from where R' Natan derives it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | The school of Menashe taught | Menachot 37a:6 | <b>The school of Menashe taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8): <b>“On your arm”; this</b> is the <b>bicep. “Between your eyes”; this</b> is the <b>crown</b> of the head. The Talmud asks: <b>Where</b> exactly on the crown of the head are the tefillin placed? <b>The school of R' Yannai say: </b> tefillin are placed on the <b>place where</b> the bone above <b>the baby’s brain is soft</b> after birth. |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | for totafot | Sanhedrin 4b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>And does everyone</b> actually hold that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the tefillin of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a second <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (11:18), this time spelled plene, with a second <i>vav</i>, in a manner that must be plural? <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here, </b> as the 3rd one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the tefillin of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | for frontlets [ totafot ] | Zevachim 37b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>But if that is so, </b> that this is the proper manner of expounding the verses, consider the case of the tefillin of the head, about which it is stated: “And <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), and: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and subsequently: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18). The word <i>totafot</i> is written once in plene form, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, and twice in a deficient form, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, indicating the singular. Accordingly, <b>there are four</b> frontlets <b>here, </b> and from here the rabbis derive that the tefillin of the head consist of four compartments, which together form a cube. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text, </b> read in the plural, <b>is effective, </b> i.e., that it requires six compartments, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text, </b> read in the singular, <b>is effective, </b> i.e., it requires four compartments, and therefore one should be <b>required to prepare five compartments</b> for the tefillin of the head? |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And write them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them [ ukhtavtam ] | Berakhot 15b:23 | <b>R' Oshaya taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava: </b> The verse, <b>“And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>]</b> on the door posts of your house and your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9), should be understood as though it were written: “And you shall write them completely [<i>ukhtav tam</i>],” i.e., in their entirety. <b>Everything must be in writing</b> in the <i>mezuza</i> or tefillin, <b>even the commands</b> to write <i>mezuzot</i> and tefillin. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | if one erred between writing and writing, | Berakhot 16a:4 | <b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and erred, and does not know where</b> exactly <b>he erred; </b> if he was <b>in the middle of a paragraph</b> when he realized his error, <b>he must return to the beginning</b> of the paragraph; <b>if</b> he was <b>between one paragraph and another</b> when he realized his error but does not remember between which paragraphs, <b>he must return to the first</b> break between <b>paragraphs. </b> Similarly, <b>if one erred between writing and writing, </b> i.e., between the verse: “And you shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9) in the first paragraph and the identical verse (Deuteronomy 11:20) in the second paragraph, <b>he must return to the first writing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | your house [ beitekha ]” | Chullin 135b:15 | Likewise, with regard to <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, </b> R' Ilai concedes that the house of two partners is obligated, <b>even though it is written: </b> “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of <b>your house [<i>beitekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), with a singular pronoun, from which one might have inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> house, <b>yes, </b> it is obligated, whereas a house owned by two people <b>in partnership</b> is <b>not</b> obligated. Consequently, <b>God writes</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“So that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). The use of the plural pronoun in the terms “your days” and “your children” in this verse indicates that partners are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term <b>“your house [<i>beitekha</i>]” come? </b> The Talmud answers: It is necessary <b>for that which Rabba</b> derived, <b>as Rabba said: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | obvious | Menachot 29a:16 | § The Mishnah teaches: With regard to the <b>two passages that are in the <i>mezuza</i>, </b> the absence of <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others. And</b> furthermore, the absence of <b>even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with</b> the rest of <b>them. </b> The Talmud asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the absence of even one letter prevents fulfillment of the mitzva, since it is written: “And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>]” (Deuteronomy 6:9), which teaches that the writing [<i>ketav</i>] must be complete [<i>tam</i>]? |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | upon your gates” | Menachot 32b:9 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: </b> If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick</b> in the entranceway, without affixing it to the doorpost, it is <b>unfit. What is the reason? We require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and <b>upon your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>This</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick, or placed it</b> so that it was affixed <b>behind the door</b> within the house, he exposes himself to <b>danger, and it</b> does <b>not</b> enable him to fulfill the <b>mitzva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them | Menachot 33a:8 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>raises</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>a handbreadth from the ground, or</b> one <b>distances</b> it <b>from the</b> cross <b>beam a handbreadth, and the entire entrance</b> between those two handbreadths is <b>fit for</b> the placement of the <b><i>mezuza</i>; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. R' Yosei says: </b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>Just as</b> the <b>binding</b> of the tefillin is performed <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the arm, <b>so too, </b> the <b>writing, </b> i.e., the placement, of a <i>mezuza</i> must be specifically <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the entrance. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them | Menachot 34a:11 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one writes</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on the stones</b> of the entrance. To counter this, an expression of <b>writing is stated here, </b> with regard to a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and</b> an expression of <b>writing is stated there. Just as there</b> the mitzva of writing means <b>on a book, </b> i.e., parchment, <b>so too, </b> a <i>mezuza</i> must be written <b>on a book. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | your house [ beitekha ]” | Menachot 34a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the source for <b>this</b> requirement that the <i>mezuza</i> be affixed to the right side? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of <b>your house [<i>beitekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), the word <i>beitekha</i> is interpreted as <b><i>biatekha</i>, </b> your entry, i.e., the <i>mezuza</i> must be affixed to the side by which you enter, which is <b>from the right. Do you say</b> it is <b>from the right, or</b> is it <b>only from the left? </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: Your house [<i>beitekha</i>]. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> here? <b>Rabba says: </b> The <i>mezuza</i> is affixed in <b>the way that you enter</b> the house, which is <b>from the right, as when a person lifts his foot</b> to begin walking, <b>he lifts his right</b> foot first. Therefore, the <i>mezuza</i> is affixed to the right side of the doorway. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | doorposts | Menachot 34a:8 | The Talmud further inquires: <b>What</b> is this statement of <b>R' Meir, </b> referred to by Rav Pappa, that he deems one obligated to place a <i>mezuza</i> on an entrance that has only one doorpost? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a house that has only one doorpost, R' Meir deems</b> one <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from affixing a <i>mezuza</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? It is written: </b> “And you shall write them upon the <b>doorposts</b> of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), in the plural, which indicates that there must be two doorposts. |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “doorposts” | Menachot 34a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of R' Meir, </b> that one doorpost suffices to obligate one to affix a <i>mezuza</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When it states <b>“doorposts”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), <b>I</b> would <b>derive the minimum</b> number <b>of doorposts, </b> which is <b>two. When it says “doorposts” in the second passage</b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), this also serves to teach a <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> otherwise there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. This <b>is</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that <b>an amplification following an amplification is</b> stated <b>only</b> in order <b>to restrict</b> its extent. In this manner <b>the verse restricted</b> the minimum number <b>to one doorpost. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them | Menachot 37a:2 | <b>R' Natan says: </b> This proof is <b>not necessary, </b> as <b>it says: “And you shall bind them</b> for a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and then it states: <b>“And you shall write them</b> upon the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9). This teaches that <b>just as writing is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, as most people write with their right hands, <b>so too, </b> the <b>binding</b> of tefillin must be performed <b>with</b> the <b>right</b> hand. <b>And since binding is with</b> the <b>right</b> hand, this means that <b>donning is on</b> the <b>left</b> arm, as one cannot bind the tefillin with the same hand upon which he is donning them. The Talmud asks: <b>And from where does R' Yosei HaḤorem, </b> who holds that the right hand is also called <i>yad</i> in the Torah, <b>derive that donning</b> tefillin is <b>on</b> the <b>left</b> arm? The Talmud answers: <b>He derives it from where R' Natan derives it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them | Menachot 44a:19 | <b>Anyone who does not have a <i>mezuza</i> in his doorway violates two positive mitzvot, </b> stated in the verses: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), and: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 11:20). |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | “And you shall write them | Shabbat 103b:13 | The Talmud <b>raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9). “And you shall write them [<i>ukhtavtam</i>]” means <b>that it should be perfect writing [<i>ketiva tamma</i>]</b> with no mistakes, and clear writing. This means that <b>one should not write</b> an <b><i>alef</i> as</b> an <b><i>ayin</i>, </b> an <b><i>ayin</i> as</b> an <b><i>alef</i>, </b> a <b><i>beit</i> as</b> a <b><i>kaf</i>, </b> a <b><i>kaf</i> as</b> a <b><i>beit</i>, </b> a <b><i>gimmel</i> as</b> a <b><i>tzadi</i>, </b> a <b><i>tzadi</i> as</b> a <b><i>gimmel</i>, </b> a <b><i>dalet</i> as</b> a <b><i>reish</i>, </b> a <b><i>reish</i> as</b> a <b><i>dalet</i>, </b> a <b><i>heh</i> as</b> a <b><i>ḥet</i>, </b> a <b><i>ḥet</i> as</b> a <b><i>heh</i>, </b> a <b><i>vav</i> as</b> a <b><i>yod</i>, </b> a <b><i>yod</i> as</b> a <b><i>vav</i>, </b> a <b><i>zayin</i> as</b> a <b><i>nun</i>, </b> a <b><i>nun</i> as</b> a <b><i>zayin</i>, </b> a <b><i>tet</i> as</b> a <b><i>peh</i>, </b> a <b><i>peh</i> as</b> a <b><i>tet</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:9 | upon your gates” | Yoma 11a:3 | § Apropos the <i>mezuza</i> in the High Priest’s chamber, the Talmud discusses other <i>halakhot</i> of <i>mezuza</i>. <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: “And you will write them upon the doorposts of your houses and <b>upon your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9): With regard to <b>the gates of houses, and the gates of courtyards, and the gates of cities, and the gates of towns, all</b> of them are <b>obligated</b> in <b>the mitzva</b> of <i>mezuza</i> in that <b>place, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And you will write them upon the doorposts of your houses and upon your gates. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | “You shall fear the Lord your God” | Bava Kamma41b:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say</b> that it was <b>Neḥemya HaAmasoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah, </b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” that you interpreted</b> until now? <b>He said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I received reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition. |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | “You shall fear the Lord your God” | Bekhorot 6b:4 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni would interpret each and every</b> occurrence of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah, </b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of <b>“</b><i>et</i><b>” that you interpreted</b> until now?

| Deuteronomy 6:13 | and it is stated: “You shall fear the Lord your God and Him you shall serve” | Kiddushin 30b:19 | Similarly, <b>it is stated: “A man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>and it is stated: “You shall fear YHWH your God and Him you shall serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). <b>The verse equates the fear of one’s father and mother to the fear of God. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | “You shall fear the Lord your God” | Kiddushin 57a:1 | The Talmud answers: This Sage <b>does not interpret</b> the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> as a means to derive new <i>halakhot</i>. He considers the word “<i>et</i>” to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say</b> that it was <b>Neḥemya HaAmasoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah, </b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | and it is written there: “You shall fear the Lord your God; and Him [ oto ] shall you serve” | Menachot 43b:9 | <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember</b> all the commandments of YHWH <b>and do</b> them. ” This teaches that <b>looking</b> at the ritual fringes <b>leads to remembering</b> the mitzvot, and <b>remembering</b> them <b>leads to doing</b> them. <b>And R' Shimon bar Yoḥai says: Anyone who is diligent in this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>merits receiving the Shekhina. </b> It is <b>written here: “That you may look upon it [<i>oto</i>]”</b> (Numbers 15:39), <b>and it is written there: “You shall fear YHWH your God; and Him [<i>oto</i>] shall you serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). Just as <i>oto</i> in that verse is referring to the Shekhina, so too in this verse it is referring to the Shekhina. |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | from here: “You shall fear the Lord, your God” | Sanhedrin 56a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>Say</b> that <i>nokev</i> means the <b>utterance of the</b> ineffable <b>name of</b> God. <b>As it is written: “And Moses and Aaron took these men that are pointed out [<i>nikkevu</i>] by name”</b> (Numbers 1:17). <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> to do so is derived <b>from here: “You shall fear YHWH, your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | and by His name you shall swear” | Temurah 3b:17 | The Talmud counters: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>this statement</b> in the verse means only that a bailee is able <b>to appease the other, </b> i.e., the owner, and exempt himself from payment for the damaged goods, <b>but</b> he <b>should</b> nevertheless <b>be flogged? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>You cannot say</b> this, <b>as it is written: </b> “You shall fear YHWH your God, and Him you shall serve, <b>and by His name you shall swear”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). This verse clearly indicates that it is permitted to take a truthful oath using the name of God. |
| Deuteronomy 6:13 | But isn’t it written: “You shall fear the Lord your God, and Him you shall serve” | Temurah 4a:2 | The Talmud counters: <b>Why not, </b> i.e., what is the difficulty? <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall fear YHWH your God, and Him you shall serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13)? Fearing God certainly includes not pronouncing His name in vain, and this verse can therefore serve as the warning. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is a warning</b> stated as <b>a positive mitzva. </b> In order to qualify as a warning, the verse must prohibit, not command. |
| Deuteronomy 6:16 | said to him: And is it permitted to test the Holy One, Blessed be He? But isn’t it written: “You shall not test the Lord your God” | Taanit 9a:3 | The boy <b>said to him: And is it permitted to test God? But isn’t it written: “You shall not test YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:16)? R' Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> the boy that <b>R' Hoshaya said as follows: </b> It is prohibited to test God in any way, <b>except in this</b> case of tithes, <b>as it is stated: “Bring the whole tithe into the storeroom, that there may be food in My house, and test Me now by this, said YHWH of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing that there shall be more than sufficiency”</b> (Malachi 3:10). |
| Deuteronomy 6:18 | is the book of Deuteronomy. And why did they call it the book of Yashar? As it is written: “And you shall do that which is right [ yashar ] and good in the sight of the Lord” | Avodah Zarah25a:13 | The Talmud cites a different interpretation: <b>R' Elazar says</b> that the book of Yashar <b>is the book of Deuteronomy. And why did they call it the book of Yashar? As it is written: “And you shall do that which is right [<i>yashar</i>] and good in the sight of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:18). <b>And where is it alluded</b> to in Deuteronomy that Judah must be taught to use the bow? The verse states: “And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; <b>his hands shall contend for him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7). <b>What is</b> the form of <b>warfare that requires</b> the use of <b>two hands? You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to the use of <b>a bow. </b> This is the referent of the verse in Samuel. |
| Deuteronomy 6:18 | remove him, as it is stated: “And you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of the Lord” | Bava Metzia108a:10 | The rabbis <b>of Neharde’a say: Even</b> if his claim was <b>due to the <i>halakha</i> of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor, <b>we</b> still <b>remove him, as it is stated: “And you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:18). One should not perform an action that is not right and good, even if he is legally entitled to do so. |
| Deuteronomy 6:18 | “And you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of the Lord” | Bava Metzia108b:4 | The Talmud clarifies this ruling: If a buyer <b>bought</b> the field <b>from a non-Jew</b> it does not apply, <b>as he</b> can <b>say to</b> the neighbor: It is better for you that I bought the field, as <b>I have chased away a lion for you from the border; </b> since the neighbor certainly prefers having a Jewish neighbor to having a non-Jew neighbor. If a seller <b>sold</b> a field <b>to a non-Jew, </b> the <b>non-Jew is certainly not bound</b> by the command of: <b>“And you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:18). The non-Jew is therefore under no obligation to refrain from purchasing this land. Nevertheless, <b>we certainly excommunicate</b> the one who sold it to the non-Jew <b>until he accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>all</b> damage resulting from <b>accidents that</b> might <b>befall</b> the neighbor <b>on</b> the non-Jew’s <b>account. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:18 | “You shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of the Lord” | Bava Metzia16b:13 | The reason for a new document to be written is <b>that according to the</b> letter of the <b>law, the land need not be returned</b> by the creditor to the debtor, <b>and it is due to</b> the principle: <b>“You shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:18), <b>that the rabbis said</b> that the land <b>should be returned. Therefore, </b> it is as though the debtor <b>is purchasing it anew, </b> and the creditor <b>must write a bill of sale. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 6:18 | that it is stated: “And you shall do that which is right and good” | Bava Metzia35a:12 | With regard to the reversal of an appraisal, the rabbis <b>of Neharde’a say: </b> After property is repossessed in order to pay an unpaid debt based on the court’s <b>appraisal</b> of the article’s value, it is <b>returned</b> to the debtor, provided he repays the debt from the time of the appraisal <b>until the twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> have passed. <b>And Ameimar said: I am from Neharde’a, and</b> nevertheless, <b>I hold that</b> repossession based on <b>an appraisal</b> of an article’s value can <b>always</b> be <b>returned. </b> If the debtor pays his debt, he can reclaim his property at any point. The Talmud rules: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that repossession based on <b>an appraisal</b> can <b>always</b> be <b>returned, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And you shall do that which is right and good”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:18). The owner of property appreciates his property more than another person would. Therefore, once the debtor repays his debt to the creditor, legal formalism should not prevent return of the debtor’s property. |
| Deuteronomy 7:2 | that the verse states: “You should not show them mercy [ lo teḥonnem ]” | Avodah Zarah20a:1 | The source is <b>that the verse states: “You should not show them mercy [<i>lo teḥonnem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:2), which is understood as meaning: <b>You should not give them</b> a chance to <b>encamp [<i>ḥanayah</i>] in, </b> i.e., to acquire <b>land</b> in, Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud asks: <b>This</b> phrase: <b>“You should not show them mercy”; </b> isn’t <b>it necessary</b> to teach <b>that this</b> is what <b>God is saying: You should not give them favor [<i>ḥen</i>]</b> by praising them? |
| Deuteronomy 7:3 | by Torah law, as it is written: “Neither shall you make marriages with them” | Avodah Zarah36b:5 | It was stated that the prohibition against marrying the daughters of non-Jews was decreed on account of idolatry. The Talmud raises an objection: But the prohibition against marrying <b>their daughters is</b> prescribed <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “Neither shall you make marriages with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3). The Talmud explains: <b>By Torah law</b> intermarriage is prohibited only with the <b>seven</b> Canaanite <b>nations, but</b> intermarriage with <b>the other nations</b> of the world is <b>not</b> prohibited, <b>and</b> the students of Shammai and Hillel <b>came and decreed</b> that intermarriage is prohibited <b>even</b> with <b>the other nations. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:3 | The verse states: “Neither shall you make marriages with them” | Kiddushin 68b:2 | § The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal with <b>a non-Jew woman</b> is ineffective? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall you make marriages with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3), which teaches that marrying non-Jew women is halakhically meaningless. The Talmud asks: <b>We have found that betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:3 | That | Kiddushin 68b:6 | The Talmud asks a question with regard to R' Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>That</b> verse: “Neither shall you make marriages with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3), <b>is written with regard to the seven nations</b> of Canaan. <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal does not take effect with the <b>other nations? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> as a reason for prohibiting intermarriages: <b>“For he will turn away your son</b> from following Me,” which serves <b>to include all those who might turn</b> a child <b>away, </b> no matter from which nation. |
| Deuteronomy 7:3 | “You shall not marry them” | Yevamot 76a:12 | <b>Rav Sheshet said to them: You</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to <b>this</b> question in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is permitted for an</b> ordinary <b>Israelite with crushed testicles</b> to marry <b>a Gibeonite woman. Now, if it enters your mind</b> that he <b>retains his sanctity</b> as a Jew, one should <b>apply here</b> the prohibition stated with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall not marry them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3). Apparently, then, one whose testicles have been crushed loses his former sanctity, and the same should apply to a priest. |
| Deuteronomy 7:4 | “For he will turn away your son from following Me” | Avodah Zarah36b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai, who says</b> that the subsequent verse: <b>“For he will turn away your son from following Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:4) serves <b>to include all who turn away</b> one’s son from God, i.e., all non-Jews, <b>what is there to say? Rather, by Torah law</b> only <b>sexual sex by way of marriage</b> are prohibited, <b>and they came</b> and <b>decreed</b> that sexual sex are prohibited <b>even by way of licentiousness. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:5 | and hew down their asherim , | Avodah Zarah45b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> doesn’t <b>R' Yosei ben Yehuda, also require</b> this phrase <b>to</b> teach <b>this? </b> The Talmud answers. <b>Indeed, </b> he does. <b>Rather, from where does he</b> derive that <b>a tree that one planted and subsequently worshipped</b> is forbidden? <b>He derives it from</b> the following verse: “But so shall you deal with them: You shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and hew down their <i>asherim</i>, </b> and burn their graven images with fire” (Deuteronomy 7:5). Now, <b>which is the tree whose trunk is forbidden but its root is permitted, </b> as the verse instructs one to hew it down? <b>You must say</b> that it is referring to <b>a tree that one planted and subsequently worshipped. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:5 | and hew down their asherim , | Avodah Zarah48a:8 | The Talmud explains what the nature of this dispute would be: <b>As R' Yosei bar Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>its trunk is also forbidden, as it is written: </b> “And you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3). Burning with fire destroys the whole tree, which indicates that the entire tree is forbidden, including its trunk. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>the trunk of the tree</b> is <b>permitted, as it is written: </b> “You shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and hew down their <i>asherim</i>, </b> and burn their graven images with fire” (Deuteronomy 7:5). <b>Which is the tree whose hewn part</b> is <b>forbidden, but its trunk</b> is <b>permitted? You must say</b> it is <b>a tree that one planted and subsequently worshipped. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:5 | “And hew down [ teggade’un ] their trees worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [ asheireihem ]” | Sotah 5a:10 | <b>R' Elazar says: </b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, </b> it is <b>fitting to hew him down, as a tree designated for idolatry [<i>asheira</i>]</b> is hewn down, as <b>it is written here</b> with regard to the arrogant: <b>“And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down [<i>gedu’im</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 10:33), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to trees designated for idolatry: <b>“And hew down [<i>teggade’un</i>] their trees worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asheireihem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:5). |
| Deuteronomy 7:7 | “Not because you are more in number than any people did the Lord desire you | Chullin 89a:5 | § <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Elazar ben Shimon: Any place where you find the statements of R' Eliezer ben Yosei HaGelili, in</b> reference to <b>aggada, make your ears like a funnel [<i>ka’afarkeset</i>], </b> i.e., be receptive to his words. As R' Eliezer interpreted the verse: <b>“Not because you are more in number than any people did YHWH desire you</b> and choose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples” (Deuteronomy 7:7), as follows: <b>God said to the Jewish people: I desire you, since even at a time that I bestow greatness</b> upon <b>you, you diminish, </b> i.e., humble, <b>yourselves before Me. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:9 | faithfulness are also forbidden to say in the bathroom, as it is written “The faithful God | Shabbat 10b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But if so, </b> words connoting <b>faithfulness are also forbidden to say in the bathroom, as it is written “The faithful God</b> who keeps the covenant and the kindness” (Deuteronomy 7:9). <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it is</b> indeed <b>so, </b> that it is forbidden to use the language of faithfulness in the bathroom, <b>didn’t Rava bar Meḥasseya say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is permitted to say faithfulness in the bathroom? </b> The Talmud answers: There is a difference between the terms: <b>There, the name</b> of God <b>itself is not called</b> in <b>that</b> way, <b>as we translate it</b> as <b>“the faithful God. ”</b> However, <b>here, the name</b> of God <b>Himself is called Shalom, as it is written: “And he called Him Lord Shalom. ”</b> It is not an adjective, but a holy name in and of itself. |
| Deuteronomy 7:9 | with those who love Him and keep His commandments for a thousand generations” | Sotah 31a:10 | The Talmud asks: But <b>there also, </b> in the second verse, <b>it is written: </b> “The faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and mercy <b>with those who love Him and keep His commandments for a thousand generations”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:9). Why is the verse interpreted specifically with regard to those who worship God out of fear, yet it is written that they keep His mitzvot out of love? Both types of people seem to be indicated in both verses. |
| Deuteronomy 7:9 | and keep His commandments for a thousand generations” | Sotah 31a:9 | Proof of this assertion is that <b>here it is written: “And showing mercy unto thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments”</b> (Exodus 20:5), indicating that merits can last for thousands of generations for those who act out of love, <b>and there it is written: </b> “Know therefore that YHWH your God, He is God; the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and mercy with those who love Him <b>and keep His commandments for a thousand generations”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:9). The first verse indicates that those who act out of love retain their merits for thousands of generations, whereas the second verse, which mentions only one thousand generations of merit, is referring to the merits of those who keep God’s mitzvot out of fear. |
| Deuteronomy 7:10 | “And He repays them that hate Him to His face to destroy them; | Eruvin 22a:3 | The Talmud proceeds to interpret a different verse homiletically: <b>“And He repays them that hate Him to His face to destroy them; </b> He will not be slack to him that hates Him, He will repay him to his face” (Deuteronomy 7:10). <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it</b> would <b>be impossible to utter it, </b> in deference to God, for it could be understood, <b>as it were, like a person who bears a burden on his face, and wishes to throw it off. </b> Written slightly differently, the verse could have been understood as implying that God is unable, as it were, to bear the situation, but must punish the wicked immediately. |
| Deuteronomy 7:11 | which I command you this day, | Avodah Zarah3a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And how can you say so, </b> that it is possible to perform a mitzva after the end of this world? <b>But doesn’t R' Yehoshua ben Levi say: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: </b> “You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, <b>which I command you this day, </b> to do them” (Deuteronomy 7:11)? This verse teaches that <b>today, </b> in this world, is the time <b>to do them, but tomorrow, </b> in the World-to-Come, <b>is not</b> the time <b>to do them. </b> Furthermore, <b>today</b> is the time <b>to do them, but today is not</b> the time <b>to receive</b> one’s <b>reward, </b> which is granted in the World-to-Come. |
| Deuteronomy 7:11 | which is written: “Which I command you this day, to do them” | Avodah Zarah4b:14 | § The Talmud presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing statements of R' Yehoshua ben Levi: <b>Today, bear witness, shake, the</b> golden <b>calf. </b> The Talmud returns to an earlier discussion (3a), first by citing <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Which I command you this day, to do them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:11)? This verse teaches that <b>today</b> is the time <b>to do them, </b> i.e., to perform the mitzvot, in this world, <b>but tomorrow, </b> in the World-to-Come, <b>is not</b> the time <b>to do them. </b> Furthermore, <b>today</b> is the time <b>to do them, but today is not</b> the time <b>to receive</b> one’s <b>reward, </b> which is given in the World-to-Come. |
| Deuteronomy 7:11 | which I command you today to do them” | Eruvin 22a:5 | <b>And that</b> is <b>what R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: </b> “And you shall keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments <b>which I command you today to do them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:11)? It means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them, </b> in this world, <b>and tomorrow</b> is <b>not</b> the time <b>to do them, </b> as there is no obligation or opportunity to fulfill mitzvot in the World-to-Come. Furthermore, it means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them, </b> but only <b>tomorrow, </b> in the ultimate future, is the time <b>to receive reward for</b> doing <b>them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:13 | and He will bless the fruit of your body” | Berakhot 51b:5 | The Talmud relates: <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Naḥman. He ate bread, recited Grace after Meals, and gave the cup of blessing to Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman said to him: Master, please send the cup of blessing to Yalta, </b> my wife. Ulla <b>responded to him: </b> There is no need, <b>as R' Yoḥanan said as follows: The fruit of a woman’s body is blessed only from the fruit of a man’s body, as it is stated: </b> “And He will love you, and bless you, and make you numerous, <b>and He will bless the fruit of your body”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:13). The Talmud infers: “He will bless <b>the fruit of her body” was not stated. Rather, </b> “He will bless <b>the fruit of your</b> [masculine singular] <b>body. ”</b> For his wife to be blessed with children, it is sufficient to give the cup to Rav Naḥman. |
| Deuteronomy 7:13 | which is written: “And the flocks [ ve’ashterot ] of your sheep” | Chullin 84b:1 | <b>One who wishes to become wealthy</b> should <b>engage in</b> raising <b>small domesticated animals. Rav Ḥisda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the flocks [<i>ve’ashterot</i>] of your sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:13)? It means <b>that</b> sheep <b>enrich [<i>me’ashrot</i>] their owners. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:14 | which is written: “There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle” | Bekhorot 44b:7 | <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:14)? It means as follows: <b>When will there not be a barren</b> male <b>among you? At a time that</b> you act as <b>among your cattle, </b> i.e., you urinate when the need arises, without hesitation. |
| Deuteronomy 7:15 | “And the Lord will take away from you all sickness” | Bava Metzia107b:2 | § The Talmud returns to expounding the themes of blessings and the evil eye. The Torah states: <b>“And YHWH will take away from you all sickness”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:15). In interpreting this verse, <b>Rav says: This</b> verse is speaking about the evil <b>eye. </b> The Talmud comments: <b>Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav went to a graveyard, </b> and <b>did what</b> he <b>did, </b> i.e., he used an incantation to find out how those buried there died, and he <b>said: Ninety-nine</b> of these died <b>by the evil eye, and</b> only <b>one</b> died <b>by</b> entirely <b>natural means. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:16 | as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that the Lord your God shall deliver unto you” | Bava Kamma113b:7 | The Talmud cites another statement related to stealing from a non-Jew. <b>Rav Beivai bar Giddel says</b> that <b>R' Shimon Ḥasida says: </b> It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a non-Jew, </b> but it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item, </b> i.e., one is not required to return it to him. The Talmud examines the basis for each of these rulings: It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a non-Jew, as Rav Huna says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a non-Jew? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that YHWH your God shall deliver unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:16), indicating that it is permitted to consume the other nations’ property only <b>when they are delivered into your hand, </b> i.e., in times of war, <b>but not when they are not delivered into your hand. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, | Avodah Zarah45a:1 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>the non-Jews who worship the mountains and the hills, </b> the mountains and hills <b>are permitted, but what is upon them is forbidden. </b> It is not prohibited to derive benefit from the mountains and hills themselves, and they can be used for planting, harvesting, and the like. But if non-Jews coated them with gold or silver, it is prohibited to derive benefit from the coating, <b>as it is stated: </b> “The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire; <b>you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, </b> nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 7:25). |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | And one verse states: “You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, | Avodah Zarah51b:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that money, clothing, or vessels found at the head of the idol are not forbidden. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: One verse states: “And you have seen their detestable things and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:16). <b>And one verse states: “You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, </b> nor take it for yourself” (Deuteronomy 7:25). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The second verse mentions the prohibition of only silver and gold, whereas the first verse also mentions wood and stone. |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them” | Avodah Zarah52a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Akiva, from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud answers: R' Akiva <b>derives it from</b> the interpretation <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel raises a contradiction: It is written: </b> “The graven images of [<i>pesilei</i>] their gods you shall burn with fire; <b>you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:25), <b>and</b> in the continuation of the verse <b>it is written: “And take it for yourself, ”</b> indicating that one is permitted to take the silver and gold. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? If the non-Jew <b>engraved</b> and carved the stone <b>as a god, </b> it is immediately rendered forbidden and the prohibition <b>“you shall not covet”</b> applies. If the non-Jew <b>revoked [<i>pesalo</i>]</b> the idol’s status <b>as a god, </b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“And take it for yourself, ”</b> applies. |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | prohibited immediately? Ulla said: The verse states: “The graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire; | Avodah Zarah52a:8 | The Talmud explains the opinion of R' Akiva: <b>And</b> as for the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, from where does he</b> derive <b>that a non-Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>prohibited immediately? Ulla said: The verse states: “The graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire; </b> you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself, lest you be snared thereby, for it is an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 7:25). The term “graven images” indicates that <b>from</b> the time <b>that</b> the non-Jew <b>engraves</b> and carves the stone into an idol <b>it becomes a god</b> and is forbidden. |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | as it is stated: “The graven images of [ pesilei ] their gods you shall burn with fire” | Avodah Zarah52a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Yishmael, how does he interpret this verse? The Talmud answers: R' Yishmael <b>requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Rav Yosef teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as Rav Yosef teaches: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a non-Jew may revoke [<i>sheposel</i>]</b> the status of an object as <b>his god? </b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “The graven images of [<i>pesilei</i>] their gods you shall burn with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:25). |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | “The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire” | Sanhedrin 93a:10 | <b>And Daniel said</b> to himself: <b>I will go</b> away <b>from here so</b> that this verse <b>will not be fulfilled in my</b> regard: <b>“The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:25). Daniel was concerned that because Nebuchadnezzar worshipped him like a deity, his legal status was that of an idol, and he would be burned. |
| Deuteronomy 7:25 | you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to you” | Temurah 28b:5 | The Talmud rejects this <i>a fortiori</i> inference with the claim that <b>if so, you have nullified</b> the requirement of the verse: “The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire; <b>you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:25). This verse is clearly referring to the coatings of items worshipped, in addition to the idols themselves. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | As it is written: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house” | Avodah Zarah15a:7 | The Talmud answers: <b>Idol worship is different, as it is</b> a particularly <b>severe</b> prohibition, and therefore even an item that does not entirely belong to a Jew is treated with great stringency. <b>As it is written: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), and this house still retains the name of its Jewish owner. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | idol worship into it, as it is stated: “You shall not bring an abomination into your house” | Avodah Zarah21a:2 | <b>Even in a place</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the rabbis <b>said</b> that it is permitted for a Jew <b>to rent</b> a house to a non-Jew, <b>they did not say</b> that one may rent it <b>for</b> use as <b>a residence, because</b> the non-Jew will <b>bring</b> objects of <b>idol worship into it, as it is stated: “You shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), and this is still considered the house of a Jew. <b>And</b> for the same reason, <b>in every place, one may not rent a bathhouse to</b> a non-Jew, <b>since it is called by the name of</b> the owner, and onlookers will think that the Jew is operating it on Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; | Avodah Zarah46a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the one who deems</b> worshipped boulders <b>forbidden? </b> The Talmud answers: According to that opinion, it is in order <b>to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>It is written: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; <b>you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; </b> for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26). This verse teaches <b>that although</b> one may theoretically <b>derive, by logical inference, to permit</b> the boulders, <b>do not derive</b> that <i>halakha</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” | Avodah Zarah46a:2 | One <b>might</b> have thought that one may give it <b>a positive</b> nickname. The Talmud interjects: Would it <b>enter your mind</b> that one may give <b>a positive</b> nickname to an idol? <b>Rather, </b> the <i>baraita</i> means that one <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to a nickname that is <b>neither positive nor negative. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; <b>you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). This verse clearly indicates that the nickname should be a negative one. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | you shall detest it [ shakketz teshakketzennu ], | Avodah Zarah47b:2 | <b>The stones of</b> the fallen wall, <b>its wood, and its dust, transmit impurity like a creeping animal, </b> i.e., one who touches them becomes impure like one who touches a creeping animal, <b>as it is stated: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; <b>you shall detest it [<i>shakketz teshakketzennu</i>], </b> and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26). The term <i>shakketz</i> is used in a different form, <i>shekketz</i>, with regard to creeping animals. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | that you should become accursed like it; | Avodah Zarah54b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who says</b> that the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange</b> is <b>prohibited? The verse states: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>that you should become accursed like it; </b> you shall utterly detest it…for it is accursed” (Deuteronomy 7:26). Not only do you become accursed, but <b>anything that you cause to become</b> yours <b>from</b> the exchange of an object of idol worship <b>is</b> accursed <b>like it, </b> i.e., is forbidden like the object of idol worship itself. <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, from where does he derive that the exchange of the exchange is permitted? <b>The verse states: </b> “For <b>it</b> is accursed. ” Infer from this that <b>“it, ”</b> the object of idol worship, is forbidden, <b>but not</b> the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | and become [ vahayita ] accursed like it” | Chullin 140a:12 | <b>Rav Pappa said: </b> The word “kosher” serves <b>to</b> exclude the use of <b>birds that were exchanged for birds of idol worship, </b> i.e., a non-Jew paid a Jew for his idol by giving the Jew birds. Such birds are prohibited from use in the metzora’s ritual, <b>as it is written</b> about objects of idol worship: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>and become [<i>vahayita</i>] accursed like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), indicating that <b>anything that you generate [<i>mehayye</i>] from it, </b> e.g., through exchange, is prohibited <b>like it. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>For what</b> function does the word “kosher” indicate that such birds are prohibited? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> exclude such birds from being <b>sent</b> away, this is unnecessary, because <b>the Torah did not say: Send</b> it away, if doing so could lead <b>to a mishap. </b> If the bird were prohibited, the Torah would not have commanded one to send it away, as others might eat it unwittingly. <b>Rather, </b> the word “kosher” serves <b>to</b> disqualify such birds for <b>slaughter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | is written: “For it is banned” | Kiddushin 58a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that any two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. <b>But according to the one who says that they do teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases, <b>what can be said? </b> Why is it not learned from these examples that money received from the sale of an item from which benefit is forbidden, is likewise forbidden? The Talmud answers: Expressions of <b>restriction are written</b> in both cases. <b>Here, </b> with regard to idol worship, it <b>is written: “For it is banned”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), which indicates only that it is banned, i.e., has its prohibition extend to money received from its sale, while other prohibited items are not. <b>And there, </b> with regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year, it <b>is written: “It is a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), which teaches that with regard to <b>“it, ” yes, </b> this <i>halakha</i> applies; but this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply to <b>anything else. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | idol worship: “And you shall be banned like it” | Kiddushin 58a:7 | § The Mishnah teaches that if <b>one sold</b> any of the items from which one is prohibited to derive benefit <b>and betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> the <b>money</b> received from <b>their</b> sale, <b>she is betrothed. </b> With regard to the possibility of deriving benefit from money received in exchange for items from which benefit is forbidden, the Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is permitted? The Talmud answers: It is <b>from</b> the fact that <b>God reveals</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> an object of <b>idol worship: “And you shall be banned like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), which teaches that <b>anything that you</b> cause to <b>come from it, </b> i.e., in exchange for it, <b>is like it. </b> It can be understood <b>by inference that</b> with regard to <b>all</b> the other <b>prohibitions of the Torah, </b> monies received for items from which benefit is forbidden are <b>permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | “You shall not bring an abomination into your house” | Makkot 22a:3 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: </b> If the reference is to the wood of an <i>ashera</i>, <b>let him also be flogged for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>“You shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), in addition to the other prohibitions enumerated. <b>Rather, </b> say: <b>What are we dealing with here? </b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one cooked</b> the sciatic nerve <b>with wood consecrated</b> for use in the Temple, <b>whose warning, </b> the source of its prohibition, is <b>from here: “And their <i>asherim</i> you shall burn in fire…you shall not do so to YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3–4), indicating that one who destroys a consecrated item violates a prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | “You shall not bring an abominable thing into your home” | Pesachim 48a:6 | <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Abaye: </b> If this case is referring to using wood from an <i>asheira</i>, <b>one should also be flogged due to</b> having transgressed the prohibition of: <b>“You shall not bring an abominable thing into your home”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). However, this would add an extra negative commandment to the list enumerated in the <i>baraita</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | you shall utterly detest it [ shaketz teshaketzenu ] | Shabbat 82b:1 | If the wall stood upon ground that <b>belonged to him and to the</b> house of <b>idolatry, </b> the area <b>is calculated as half and half</b> as far as moving into his property before rebuilding the wall, and one may build the wall four cubits from the middle of the wall. <b>Its stones and its wood and its dust</b> from the house of idolatry <b>transmit impurity like creeping animals, </b> and by rabbinic decree, one who touches them becomes impure like one who touches a creeping animal, <b>as it is stated: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house and become banned like it, <b>you shall utterly detest it [<i>shaketz teshaketzenu</i>]</b> and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is a banned object” (Deuteronomy 7:26). <i>Shaketz</i> is a term used with regard to creeping animals. <b>R' Akiva says: </b> Idolatry transmits impurity <b>like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will cast them away as you would a menstruating woman [<i>dava</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying, </b> as one who moves a menstruating woman without touching her becomes impure, <b>so too, idolatry transmits impurity</b> imparted <b>by carrying. Rabba said</b> in explanation of that which <b>the verse said: “You will cast them away”: Make them foreign to you like a stranger. </b> The end of the same verse: <b>“You will tell it, get out”</b> means that under <b>no</b> circumstances can you <b>say to it, come in. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house” | Sotah 4b:10 | <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: Any person who has arrogance within him</b> is considered <b>as if he were an idol worshipper, </b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to YHWH”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there</b> concerning the destruction of idols: <b>“And you shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). |
| Deuteronomy 7:26 | and be [ vehayita ] accursed like it” | Temurah 30b:7 | <b>If you wish, say</b> that this is learned from <b>a verse: It is written with regard to</b> an animal used for <b>idol worship: </b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>and be [<i>vehayita</i>] accursed like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). This teaches that <b>anything that you create [<i>mehayye</i>] from</b> the idol <b>is</b> prohibited <b>like</b> the idol <b>itself. </b> But <b>with regard to an ox that is stoned, it is written: </b> “The ox shall surely be stoned, and <b>its flesh shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 21:28). This teaches that only <b>its flesh is forbidden, </b> but <b>its excrement is permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:3 | “ Onata ”; this is sustenance, and so it says: “And He afflicted you [ vayanekha ], and made you suffer hunger, | Ketubot 47b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>R' Elazar says: “<i>She’era</i>”; this is</b> her <b>conjugal rights, and so it says: “None of you shall approach to any who is near [<i>she’er</i>] of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:6), which demonstrates that the word <i>she’er</i> is used in the context of sexual sex. <b>“<i>Kesuta</i>” is</b> understood <b>in its literal sense</b> as referring to clothing. <b>“<i>Onata</i>”; this is sustenance, and so it says: “And He afflicted you [<i>vayanekha</i>], and made you suffer hunger, </b> and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3). |
| Deuteronomy 8:3 | “And He afflicted you, and suffered you to hunger and fed you | Sanhedrin 99a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer says: The messianic era</b> will be <b>forty years</b> long. <b>It is written here</b> with regard to the forty-year sojourn of the children of Israel in the wilderness: <b>“And He afflicted you, and suffered you to hunger and fed you</b> with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3); <b>and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us, the years that we saw evil”</b> (Psalms 90:15). |
| Deuteronomy 8:3 | affliction is stated further on | Yoma 74b:11 | <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught</b> the following concerning the nature of Yom Kippur: The word <b>affliction is stated here</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>and</b> the word <b>affliction is stated further on</b> in a different place, concerning the Jews in the desert: “And He afflicted you and caused you to hunger” (Deuteronomy 8:3). <b>Just as further on</b> the meaning of <b>affliction</b> is <b>hunger, so too, here, </b> the meaning of the word <b>affliction</b> is <b>hunger. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:5 | Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: “As a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you” | Berakhot 5a:22 | <b>Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: “As a man rebukes his son, so YHWH your God rebukes you”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:5), <b>and it is written thereafter: “For YHWH your God will bring you to a good land. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | in terms of blessing as well, as it is stated: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” | Berakhot 41a:8 | <b>As Rav Yosef, and some say R' Yitzḥak, said: Each</b> food whose significance is manifest in that it <b>precedes</b> the others <b>in this verse, </b> which sings the praises of Eretz Yisrael, <b>takes precedence</b> over the others <b>in terms of blessing as well, as it is stated: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:8). |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | “A land of wheat and barley, | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley, </b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless YHWH your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). Rabban Gamliel concludes from here that the fruits for which Eretz Yisrael was praised are included in the mitzva to recite a blessing after eating. Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings. |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | in the Torah, as it is written: “A land of wheat, and barley, | Eruvin 4a:11 | The Talmud questions this assertion: Are <b>measures</b> a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “A land of wheat, and barley, </b> and vines, and figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and Rav Ḥanan said: This entire verse was stated for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>measures</b> with regard to different <i>halakhot</i> in the Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | One may bring first fruits only from the seven species | Menachot 84a:14 | § <b>We learned</b> in a Mishnah <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:3): <b>One may bring first fruits only from the seven species</b> with which Eretz Yisrael is praised in the verse: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8). <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | and “land” is stated there | Menachot 84b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, </b> for <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does he use this</b> term <b>“your land”? </b> He holds that the term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel, son of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says: </b> “From your <b>land” is stated here</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2), with regard to the first fruits, <b>and “land” is stated there</b> with regard to the praise of Eretz Yisrael: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), which are the seven species. This serves as the basis for a verbal analogy and teaches that <b>just as there, </b> the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so too, here, </b> with regard to the mitzva to bring the first fruits, the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, i.e., the seven species. |
| Deuteronomy 8:8 | in the Torah, as it is written: “A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” | Sukkah 5b:14 | The Talmud questions this assertion: Are <b>measures</b> a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and Rav Ḥanin said: This entire verse is stated for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>measures</b> with regard to different <i>halakhot</i> in the Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | orla , and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing” | Berakhot 36b:15 | <b>The Talmud raised an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>, that regarding the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>R' Meir would say: By inference from that which is stated: “You shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>, ” don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather, </b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”? To include a tree whose wood and fruit have the same taste. And which</b> tree <b>is this? This is the pepper</b> tree. <b>And</b> this comes <b>to teach you that the peppers, </b> and even the wood portions, are edible and are therefore <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>, and to teach that Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Obviously, </b> peppers are fit for consumption. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity” | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley, </b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless YHWH your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). Rabban Gamliel concludes from here that the fruits for which Eretz Yisrael was praised are included in the mitzva to recite a blessing after eating. Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | orla . And Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing” | Sukkah 35a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> that it is referring to the <b>pepper</b> tree, since the taste of its trunk and the taste of its fruit are alike, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>R' Meir would say</b> that <b>by inference from that which is stated</b> “and plant any tree,” <b>don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food? Rather, </b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Any tree for food”? </b> It is <b>to include a tree that the taste of its tree</b> trunk <b>and</b> the taste of its <b>fruit are alike. And which</b> tree <b>is this? You must say this is the pepper</b> tree. This comes <b>to teach you that the peppers, </b> and even its trunk, are edible, and therefore the tree is <b>obligated</b> in the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>. And Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, as it is stated: “A land where you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall lack nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). From where, then, is it derived that the Torah commands the taking of an <i>etrog</i> as one of the four species? Perhaps the verse is referring to peppers. |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | there; we learned it from here, as it is written: “A land whose stones [ avaneha ] are iron” | Taanit 4a:3 | <b>R' Abba said to Rav Ashi: You learned</b> the proof for this idea <b>from</b> that verse <b>there; we learned it from here, as it is written: “A land whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>] are iron”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>], ” rather, </b> read it as <b>whose builders [<i>boneha</i>], </b> since Torah scholars build the land spiritually and are as tough as iron. With regard to these statements praising the toughness of a Torah scholar, <b>Ravina said: And even so, one is required to teach himself to act gently, as it is stated: “And remove anger from your heart, </b> and put away evil from your flesh” (Ecclesiastes 11:10). |
| Deuteronomy 8:9 | “You will not lack anything in it” | Yoma 81b:6 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> to this. <b>R' Meir would say</b> about the verse: “And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of it as forbidden [<i>orla</i>]; three years it shall be forbidden to you, it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>From the implication of what is stated: “Then you shall count the fruit of it as forbidden, ” do I not know that</b> the verse is referring to <b>“trees for food, ”</b> since it uses the word “fruit”? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “trees for food”? </b> It includes <b>a tree whose wood and fruit taste the same, </b> i.e., a tree that is itself eaten in addition to its fruit. One <b>must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>pepper</b> that grows on a tree, <b>to teach you that</b> even <b>pepper is subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of <i>orla</i>. And</b> this also teaches that <b>Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, </b> as even pepper can grow there, <b>as it is stated</b> among the listed praises of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“You will not lack anything in it”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). In any event, it has been derived that pepper is called food, which contradicts Rava’s statement. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | “And you shall eat, and be satisfied, | Arakhin 4a:4 | Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that since <b>God states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And you shall eat, and be satisfied, </b> and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), the obligation to recite Grace after Meals is contingent upon eating and being satisfied. Since <b>there is</b> eating and satisfaction in the case of priests partaking of the sacrificial meat, they are obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i>, despite the fact that the purpose of the meal is to bring about atonement. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | But isn’t it written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless | Bava Metzia114a:9 | The Talmud is puzzled by this claim: <b>And</b> is consecrated property <b>not</b> in need of a blessing? <b>But isn’t it written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), indicating that consecrated property also requires a blessing? <b>Rather, </b> the reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the restoration of collateral: <b>“And it shall be righteousness [<i>tzedaka</i>] for you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), which is referring to caring for <b>one who requires charity [<i>tzedaka</i>], excluding consecrated</b> property, <b>which</b> does <b>not require charity. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God” | Berakhot 20b:15 | After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Talmud cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>R' Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>R' Asi: The ministering angels said before God: God!, in Your Torah it is written: </b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You, </b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “YHWH shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless YHWH until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk. </b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” | Berakhot 21a:3 | <b>Rav Yehuda said: From where is</b> the mitzva <b>by Torah law</b> to recite <b>Grace after Meals, </b> derived? <b>As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10). |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God | Berakhot 44a:9 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley, </b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless YHWH your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). Rabban Gamliel concludes from here that the fruits for which Eretz Yisrael was praised are included in the mitzva to recite a blessing after eating. Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | Grace after Meals is from the Torah? As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless | Berakhot 48b:5 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Grace after Meals is from the Torah? As it is stated: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless</b> YHWH, your God, for the good land that He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Talmud explains: <b>And you shall bless, that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all. <b>YHWH, your God, that is the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> in which God’s name is invoked. <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land; good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25), which is interpreted homiletically as referring to Jerusalem and the Temple. <b>That He gave you, that is: Who is good and does good. </b> However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>You said</b> that it can be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: When one is satisfied, he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> and thank God for food; <b>when he is hungry, all the more so</b> that he should recite a blessing to offer thanks for the food he will eat. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | it, | Chullin 107a:12 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a Mishnah (<i>Sukka</i> 26b): <b>And when they gave R' Tzadok</b> on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth, and he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i>, </b> as he held one is not obligated to eat food of this amount in a <i>sukka</i>. <b>And he did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it, </b> since less than an egg-bulk does not satisfy the verse: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). <b>What, is it not</b> to be inferred that <b>consequently, </b> if one eats <b>an egg-bulk, </b> it <b>requires washing of the hands, </b> even if one uses a cloth? |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | verses. Rabbi Meir holds | Pesachim 49b:17 | <b>Abaye said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions. <b>There, they disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of <b>verses, </b> while <b>here, they disagree with regard to logical reasoning. </b> How so? <b>There, </b> with regard to <i>zimmun</i>, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of <b>verses. R' Meir holds</b> that the verse: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10) should be understood as follows: <b>“And you shall eat, ” that is eating; “and be satisfied, ” that is drinking. </b> The standard halakhic principle is that <b>eating</b> is defined as the consumption of <b>an olive-bulk. And R' Yehuda holds: “And you shall eat and you shall be satisfied”</b> refers <b>to eating that includes satisfaction. And what is</b> considered eating with satisfaction? It is consumption of <b>an egg-bulk. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | As it is written: “And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God” | Sotah 33a:10 | § It is stated in the Mishnah that <b>Grace after Meals</b> may be recited in any language. <b>As it is written: “And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and bless YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10). The word “bless” is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>In any language that you bless. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | it. | Sukkah 26b:9 | In contrast, the Mishnah relates: <b>And when they gave R' Tzadok less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth</b> for cleanliness; he did not wash his hands because in his opinion, one is not required to wash his hands before eating less than an egg-bulk. <b>And he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i> and did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it. </b> He holds that one is not required to recite a blessing after eating less than an egg-bulk, as it is not satisfying, and it is written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Talmud will explain the halakhic rationale for each of these actions described. |
| Deuteronomy 8:10 | With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds | Yoma 79b:9 | <b>Rather, </b> it cannot be proven from here. Proof can be found <b>from here: How much</b> must one eat <b>to obligate</b> those with whom he ate in <b>an invitation</b> [<b><i>zimmun</i>]</b> for Grace After Meals? <b>An olive-bulk</b> of food suffices to obligate those with whom they ate in a <i>zimmun</i>; these are <b>the words of R' Meir. R' Yehuda says: An egg-bulk</b> is the minimum measure to obligate those with whom they ate in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Talmud clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? R' Meir holds</b> that the verse “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10) should be understood as follows: <b>“And you shall eat”; this</b> is referring to <b>eating. “And be satisfied”; this</b> is referring to <b>drinking. </b> The definition of <b>eating</b> throughout the Torah is consuming <b>an olive-bulk. R' Yehuda holds: “And you shall eat and be satisfied”</b> is referring to <b>eating that causes satisfaction, and what is that? </b> The volume of <b>an egg-bulk. </b> Less than that amount of food is not satisfying. |
| Deuteronomy 8:11 | “Beware lest you forget the Lord your God” | Sotah 5a:2 | § The Talmud previously discussed the impropriety of the trait of arrogance. Now the Talmud discusses the source of its prohibition. <b>From where is the warning</b> derived, i.e., what is the source prohibiting the behavior <b>of the arrogant? Rava says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says: </b> The source is from the verse: <b>“Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud, </b> for YHWH has spoken” (Jeremiah 13:15). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the warning is <b>from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:14), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that same passage: <b>“Beware lest you forget YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:11). |
| Deuteronomy 8:14 | from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord” | Berakhot 32a:12 | On a similar note, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say</b> in a popular maxim: <b>Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me”</b> (Hosea 13:6). <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but <b>from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn</b> to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20). |
| Deuteronomy 8:14 | as it is stated: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God” | Sotah 4b:11 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said his own</b> statement: Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he has denied the core</b> belief in God’s existence, <b>as it is stated: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). |
| Deuteronomy 8:14 | from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget | Sotah 5a:2 | § The Talmud previously discussed the impropriety of the trait of arrogance. Now the Talmud discusses the source of its prohibition. <b>From where is the warning</b> derived, i.e., what is the source prohibiting the behavior <b>of the arrogant? Rava says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says: </b> The source is from the verse: <b>“Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud, </b> for YHWH has spoken” (Jeremiah 13:15). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the warning is <b>from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:14), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that same passage: <b>“Beware lest you forget YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:11). |
| Deuteronomy 8:15 | as it is written: “Who brought forth [ hamotzi ] for you water from a rock of flint” | Berakhot 38a:14 | We learned in the Mishnah <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. R' Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought, </b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth, </b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>R' Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am YHWH your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past. |
| Deuteronomy 8:16 | in order to afflict you” | Yoma 74b:14 | § Apropos the verse: “And he afflicted you and caused you to hunger, and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3), the Talmud expounds related verses. The Torah states: <b>“Who feeds you manna in the desert</b> which your fathers did not know, <b>in order to afflict you”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:16). What affliction was there in eating the manna? <b>R' Ami and R' Asi</b> disagreed on the matter. <b>One said: There is no comparison between one who has bread in his basket and one who does not have bread in his basket. </b> The affliction in eating the manna lay in there being no leftover food for the next day. Each day the people worried that they might not have any food to eat the next day. <b>And one said: There is no comparison between one who sees</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it <b>and one who does not see</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it. Though the manna could taste like anything, it always looked the same and did not look as it tasted. Being unable to see the food that they tasted was an affliction. |
| Deuteronomy 9:1 | cities great and fortified up to heaven” | Chullin 90b:12 | <b>The Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language, </b> as it is written: “Hear, Israel: You are passing over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, <b>cities great and fortified up to heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:1), whereas the fortifications obviously did not actually reach up to heaven. <b>The Prophets spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language, </b> as it is written with regard to the coronation of King Solomon: “And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, <b>so that the earth rent with the sound of them”</b> (I Kings 1:40), where the verse means merely that the sound was very loud. |
| Deuteronomy 9:1 | cities great and fortified up to heaven” | Tamid 29a:8 | The Talmud cites examples for this statement: The <b>Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language, as it is written: </b> “Hear, Israel: You are passing over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, <b>cities great and fortified up to heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:1). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that the cities were literally fortified <b>up to heaven? Rather, </b> this is <b>an exaggeration. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 9:9 | One verse says: “And I sat [ va’eshev ] on the mount” | Megillah 21a:17 | The Talmud points out an apparent contradiction with regard to this very issue. <b>One verse says: “And I sat [<i>va’eshev</i>] on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:9), <b>and another verse says: “And I stood on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:10). The Talmud cites several possible resolutions. <b>Rav said: </b> Moses would <b>stand and learn</b> the Torah from God, and then <b>sit and review</b> what he had learned. <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> Moses was <b>not standing or sitting, but rather bowing. R' Yoḥanan said: </b> The term <b><i>yeshiva</i> is nothing more than an expression of remaining</b> in one place, <b>as it is stated: “And you dwelled [<i>vateshvu</i>] in Kadesh for many days”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:46). <b>Rava said: </b> Moses studied <b>easy</b> material while <b>standing and difficult</b> material while <b>sitting. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 9:9 | “Bread I did not eat and water I did not drink” | Yoma 75b:11 | <b>A baraita states: </b> The Torah states: “And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and He gave them of the grain of heaven. <b>Man did eat the bread of the mighty [<i>abirim</i>]”</b> (Psalms 78:24–25). “Bread of the mighty” is <b>bread that the ministering angels eat; </b> this is the <b>statement of R' Akiva. When these words were said before R' Yishmael, he said to them</b> to <b>go and tell Akiva: Akiva you have erred. Do the ministering angels eat bread? It is already stated</b> about Moses, when he ascended on high: <b>“Bread I did not eat and water I did not drink”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:9). If even a man who ascends on high does not need to eat, certainly the ministering angels do not need to eat. <b>Rather, how do I establish</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>abirim</i>? </b> It can be explained as <b>bread that was absorbed into</b> all <b>248 limbs [<i>eivarim</i>], </b> so that there was no waste. |
| Deuteronomy 9:10 | and on them was written according to all the words which the Lord spoke with you in the mountain” | Megillah 19b:5 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: </b> “And YHWH delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God; <b>and on them was written according to all the words which YHWH spoke with you in the mountain”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:10)? <b>This teaches that God showed Moses</b> on the mountain all <b>the inferences</b> that can be derived from the words of <b>the Torah; and</b> all <b>the inferences</b> that can be derived from the words <b>of the Scribes, </b> the early rabbis; <b>and</b> also <b>all</b> the new <i>halakhot</i> <b>that the Scribes were destined to introduce</b> in the future in addition to the laws of the Torah. <b>And what is it</b> specifically that the Scribes would introduce in addition to the laws of the Torah? <b>The reading of the Megilla. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 9:14 | “Leave Me be, that I may destroy them” | Berakhot 32a:14 | The Talmud elaborates upon additional aspects of the sin of the Golden Calf. It is stated: <b>“And YHWH said to Moses: Go and descend, </b> for your people whom you have lifted out of the land of Egypt have been corrupted” (Exodus 32:7). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“go and descend”? R' Elazar said: God said to Moses: Moses, descend from your greatness. Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel, </b> so that you may serve as an emissary, <b>that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I</b> need <b>you? </b> There is no need for an emissary. <b>Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak</b> in defense of Israel. <b>And once</b> God <b>said</b> to Moses: <b>“Leave Me be, that I may destroy them”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:14), <b>Moses said</b> to himself: If God is telling me to let Him be, it must be because <b>this matter is dependent upon me. Immediately Moses stood and was strengthened in prayer, and asked</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on the nation of Israel and forgive them for their transgression. |
| Deuteronomy 9:14 | and I will make from you a nation mightier | Berakhot 7a:35 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that all of God’s promises are fulfilled? We know this <b>from Moses our teacher, </b> as God promised and <b>said: “Leave Me alone; I will destroy them</b> and blot out their name from under heaven; <b>and I will make from you a nation mightier</b> and greater than they” (Deuteronomy 9:14). <b>Even though</b> Moses <b>prayed</b> to have the decree repealed, <b>and</b> it <b>was nullified, the promise was fulfilled</b> and Moses’ <b>descendants</b> became a nation mightier and greater than the 600,000 Israelites in the desert. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Levites: <b>“The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer…and the sons of Eliezer were Reḥaviya the chief. </b> And Eliezer had no other sons; <b>and the sons of Reḥaviya were very many”</b> (I Chronicles 23:15–17). |
| Deuteronomy 9:17 | from this verse, as it is written: “And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them | Nedarim 38a:8 | <b>Rather, </b> the fact that Moses was mighty is derived <b>from this verse, as it is written: “And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them</b> before your eyes” (Deuteronomy 9:17), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tablets, their length was six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their width was six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness was three</b> handbreadths. If Moses was capable of lifting and casting a burden that heavy, apparently he was mighty. |
| Deuteronomy 9:17 | and broke them before your eyes” | Pesachim 87b:22 | <b>And this is</b> expressed in the statement of <b>R' Alexandri, who said: </b> There are <b>three</b> that <b>returned to their</b> points of <b>origin, </b> and <b>these are they: The Jewish people, the money of Egypt, and the writing</b> on the <b>Tablets</b> of the Covenant. <b>The Jewish people; that which we</b> just <b>said, </b> they returned to Babylonia. <b>The money of Egypt; as it is written: “And it came to pass in the 5th year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem; </b> and he took away the treasures of the house of YHWH and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything” (I Kings 14:25–26). <b>The writing on the Tablets</b> of the Covenant; <b>as it is written: </b> “And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, <b>and broke them before your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:17). And <b>it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>The tablets were broken and the letters are flying</b> and returning to their point of origin. |
| Deuteronomy 9:19 | charity in secret is greater than Moses, our teacher. Whereas with regard to Moses, our teacher, it is written: “For I was afraid of the anger and the wrath” | Bava Batra9b:7 | § The Talmud resumes its discussion of the virtues of giving charity. <b>R' Elazar said: One who performs</b> acts of <b>charity in secret is greater than Moses, our teacher. Whereas with regard to Moses, our teacher, it is written: “For I was afraid of the anger and the wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19), <b>with regard to one who performs</b> acts of <b>charity it is written: “A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a present in the bosom fierce wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14). The Talmud comments: <b>And this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> a statement <b>of R' Yitzḥak, as R' Yitzḥak says: </b> A secret gift <b>pacifies anger, </b> but it <b>does not pacify wrath, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom fierce wrath, ”</b> meaning that <b>although a present is in the bosom, </b> i.e., even if one gives charity in secret, nevertheless <b>fierce wrath</b> can still harm him. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>R' Yitzḥak says</b> as follows: <b>Any judge who accepts a bribe brings fierce wrath upon the world, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom</b> fierce wrath. ” |
| Deuteronomy 9:19 | “For I was in dread of the anger and wrath” | Nedarim 32a:4 | <b>At that moment, Moses our teacher wanted to kill them, as it is stated: “Cease from anger [<i>af</i> ] and forsake wrath [<i>ḥeima</i>]”</b> (Psalms 37:8), which indicates that he wanted to harm them. <b>And there are those who say: He killed</b> the angel named <b>Ḥeima, as it is stated: “Wrath is not in me”</b> (Isaiah 27:4). The Talmud asks: How is it possible to say that he killed Ḥeima? <b>Isn’t it written</b> that Moses himself said much later: <b>“For I was in dread of the anger and wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19)? The Talmud answers: <b>There are two</b> types of <b>wrath. And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the army of Ḥeima</b> remained but not the angel itself. |
| Deuteronomy 9:21 | the calf that you had made, I took and burned it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mount” | Avodah Zarah44a:1 | <b>the calf that you had made, I took and burned it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:21)? Moses, who ground up the idolatrous golden calf and dispersed its dust, was apparently unconcerned with the fact that it may fertilize the soil. |
| Deuteronomy 9:21 | The verse states: “And I took your sin, the calf that you had made, | Avodah Zarah52a:4 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that a Jew’s idol is forbidden only once it is worshipped, just <b>as a non-Jew’s</b> idol is forbidden only once it is worshipped. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And I took your sin, the calf that you had made, </b> and I burned it with fire” (Deuteronomy 9:21), which indicates that <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> its <b>making</b> its worshippers were <b>liable for</b> the <b>sin. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 9:25 | for the forty days and forty nights | Berakhot 34a:11 | Continuing on the subject of prayer, <b>A baraita states: </b> There was <b>an incident where one student descended</b> to serve as prayer leader <b>before the ark in the presence of R' Eliezer, and he was excessively prolonging his prayer. His students</b> complained and <b>said to him: How long-winded he is. He said to them: Is</b> this student <b>prolonging</b> his prayer any more <b>than Moses our teacher</b> did? <b>As about</b> Moses <b>it is written: </b> “And I prostrated myself before YHWH <b>for the forty days and forty nights</b> that I prostrated myself” (Deuteronomy 9:25). There is no limit to the duration of a prayer. |
| Deuteronomy 10:1 | “Make for you an Ark of wood” | Menachot 28b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <b>trumpets</b> were unfit for future generations? <b>If we say that</b> it is because <b>the verse states: “Make for you</b> two silver trumpets” (Numbers 10:2), meaning that they are fit <b>for you, but not for</b> future <b>generations, </b> that is difficult; <b>if that is so, </b> then the verse: <b>“Make for you an Ark of wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), should <b>also</b> teach <b>that</b> the Ark is fit only <b>for you, but not for</b> future <b>generations. </b> This cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as the <i>baraita</i> stated explicitly that all vessels, other than the trumpets, that were fashioned by Moses were fit for future generations. |
| Deuteronomy 10:1 | one verse says: “And make you an ark of wood” | Yoma 3b:3 | <b>Abba Ḥanan said in the name of R' Elazar</b> that <b>one verse says: “And make you an ark of wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), indicating that it should be from your own property; <b>and one verse says</b> on the same subject: <b>“And they shall make an ark of acacia wood”</b> (Exodus 25:10), meaning from the Jewish people. <b>How</b> can <b>this</b> contradiction be resolved? <b>Here, </b> the verse is referring <b>to a time when the Jewish people perform the will of God</b> and they are credited with building the Ark of the Covenant. <b>There, </b> it is referring <b>to a time when the Jewish people do not perform the will of God, </b> and construction of the Ark is attributed to Moses alone. According to that opinion, there is no difference between the offerings of Yom Kippur and other offerings. |
| Deuteronomy 10:1 | Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction: It is written: “And you shall make for yourself a wooden Ark” | Yoma 72b:8 | <b>R' Yoḥanan raised a contradiction: It is written: “And you shall make for yourself a wooden Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1), implying that Moses alone was commanded to construct the Ark; <b>and it is written: “And they shall make an Ark of acacia wood”</b> (Exodus 25:10), implying that the Jewish people were all commanded to be involved in its construction. The apparent resolution to this contradiction is that although only Moses actually constructed the Ark, everyone was required to support the endeavor. So too, <b>from here</b> it is derived with regard <b>to a Torah scholar that the members of his town should perform his work for him</b> to support him and allow him to focus on his studies, since it is also the town’s responsibility to enable him to study. |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | to serve Him, and to bless in His name” | Arakhin 11a:10 | The Talmud objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that this service with the name of God is referring to the <b>lifting of the hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction, which also includes the mention of the name of God. If so, the verse is referring to priests, not ordinary Levites. The Talmud responds: <b>From the fact that it is written: </b> “At that time YHWH separated the tribe of Levi…<b>to serve Him, and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8), it can be derived <b>by inference that the Priestly Benediction is not</b> considered <b>service, </b> as the verse mentions service and the Priestly Benediction as distinct rituals. |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | A Levite precedes an Israelite, as it is stated: “At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, | Horayot 13a:18 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A priest precedes a Levite, as it is stated: “The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses, and Aaron was separated that he should be sanctified as the most sacred”</b> (I Chronicles 23:13). <b>A Levite precedes an Israelite, as it is stated: “At that time YHWH separated the tribe of Levi, </b> to bear the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, to stand before YHWH to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day” (Deuteronomy 10:8). |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | between Levites and Israelites, as it is written: “At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi | Pesachim 104a:10 | <b>They say</b> in answer to this question: The distinction between <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites is two matters, </b> i.e., it counts as two separate distinctions. One distinction is <b>between Levites and Israelites, as it is written: “At that time YHWH separated the tribe of Levi</b> to bear the Ark of the covenant of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 10:8). A further distinction is that <b>between the priests and the Levites, as it is written: “The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should be sanctified as most holy, </b> he and his sons forever” (I Chronicles 23:13). |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | to minister to Him and to bless in His name” | Sotah 38a:5 | <b>R' Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this from a verbal analogy, as <b>it says</b> in the verse: “At that time YHWH separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, to stand before YHWH <b>to minister to Him and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8). <b>Just as</b> a priest <b>performs the</b> Temple <b>service while standing, so too, he blesses while standing. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>he performs the service itself</b> while standing? <b>As it is written: “To stand to minister</b> in the name of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 18:5). |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | service | Sotah 38a:8 | <b>R' Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive from a verbal analogy that the Priestly Benediction is recited with lifted hands, as <b>it says</b> with regard to Aaron: “To stand to minister in the name of YHWH, <b>him and his sons forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5). In this verse, <b>his sons are juxtaposed with him. Just as</b> Aaron recited the Priestly Benediction <b>with lifted hands, so too, his sons</b> recite the benediction <b>with lifted hands. And</b> furthermore, <b>it is written “forever, ”</b> which indicates that it is referring not only to special occasions. <b>And</b> although the verse is not referring to the Priestly Benediction, the <b>benediction is juxtaposed to</b> the Temple <b>service</b> in another verse: “To minister to Him and to bless in His name” (Deuteronomy 10:8). |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | the verse states: “To minister to Him and to bless in His name” | Taanit 26b:17 | <b>R' Zeira’s father, and some say</b> it was <b>Oshaya bar Zavda, strongly objects to this</b> explanation. <b>If</b> you wish to compare these two cases, you can argue as follows: <b>Just as it is prohibited</b> for <b>a nazirite</b> to eat grape <b>pits, </b> as he may not partake of any of the products of a grapevine, <b>so too, </b> it should be <b>prohibited for a priest who recites the benediction</b> to eat grape <b>pits. </b> Certainly a priest is not barred from raising his hands after eating a few grape pits. Rather, <b>R' Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>the verse states: “To minister to Him and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8). <b>Just as</b> it <b>is permitted</b> for a priest <b>who ministers</b> to God in the Temple to partake <b>of</b> grape <b>pits, so too, </b> it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a priest who recites the benediction</b> to partake <b>of</b> grape <b>pits. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 10:8 | to stand before the Lord to minister to Him” | Zevachim 16a:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> one who is <b>sitting is fit</b> to perform sacrificial rites <b>on</b> a private <b>altar? </b> If he is not, one can refute the common element in the same manner as above. The Talmud responds: <b>The verse states: </b> “YHWH separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, <b>to stand before YHWH to minister to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8). The verse indicates that the sacrificial rites must be performed while standing only <b>before YHWH, </b> i.e., in the Temple, where the Shekhina resides, <b>and not before</b> a private <b>altar, </b> which is a mere place of worship. |
| Deuteronomy 10:10 | and it is written thereafter: “And the Lord heard me that time as well, | Berakhot 32b:8 | The Talmud cites other statements in praise of prayer: <b>R' Ḥanin said</b> that <b>R' Ḥanina said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer is</b> assured that <b>his prayer does not return unanswered; </b> it will surely be accepted. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Moses our teacher, as it is stated</b> that Moses said: “So I fell down before YHWH the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; <b>and I prayed to YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:26–27), <b>and it is written thereafter: “And YHWH heard me that time as well, </b> YHWH would not destroy you” (Deuteronomy 10:10). |
| Deuteronomy 10:10 | and another verse says: “And I stood on the mount” | Megillah 21a:17 | The Talmud points out an apparent contradiction with regard to this very issue. <b>One verse says: “And I sat [<i>va’eshev</i>] on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:9), <b>and another verse says: “And I stood on the mount”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:10). The Talmud cites several possible resolutions. <b>Rav said: </b> Moses would <b>stand and learn</b> the Torah from God, and then <b>sit and review</b> what he had learned. <b>R' Ḥanina said: </b> Moses was <b>not standing or sitting, but rather bowing. R' Yoḥanan said: </b> The term <b><i>yeshiva</i> is nothing more than an expression of remaining</b> in one place, <b>as it is stated: “And you dwelled [<i>vateshvu</i>] in Kadesh for many days”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:46). <b>Rava said: </b> Moses studied <b>easy</b> material while <b>standing and difficult</b> material while <b>sitting. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear | Berakhot 33b:23 | Tangentially, the Talmud cites an additional statement by R' Ḥanina concerning principles of faith. <b>And R' Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven. </b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does YHWH your God ask of you other than to fear</b> YHWH your God, to walk in all of His ways, to love Him and to serve YHWH your God with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 10:12). YHWH asks man to perform these matters because ultimately, the choice is in his hands. |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear | Megillah 25a:9 | Tangentially, the Talmud cites an additional statement by R' Ḥanina, concerning principles of faith. <b>R' Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven. </b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does YHWH your God ask of you other than to fear</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks man to fear Him indicates that it is in man’s ability to do so. |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | “And now, Israel, what [ ma ] does the Lord your God require of you” | Menachot 43b:15 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Meir would say: A person is obligated to recite one hundred blessings every day, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And now, Israel, what [<i>ma</i>] does YHWH your God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). R' Meir interprets the verse as though it said one hundred [<i>me’a</i>], rather than <i>ma</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear | Niddah 16b:13 | The Talmud notes: <b>But</b> this angel <b>does not say: </b> Will he be <b>wicked or righteous? </b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of R' Ḥanina, as R' Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hand of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven. </b> People have free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does YHWH your God ask of you other than to fear</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks of the Jewish people to fear Him indicates that it is a person’s choice to do so. |
| Deuteronomy 10:12 | “What”; as it is written: “What does the Lord God require of you” | Sotah 11a:5 | With regard to Miriam’s deed the verse states: <b>“And his sister stood afar off, </b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>R' Yitzḥak says: This entire verse is stated in reference to the Shekhina, </b> i.e., each phrase alludes to the Shekhina watching over Moses. <b>“And</b> his sister <b>stood”; as it is written: “And YHWH came, and stood”</b> (I Samuel 3:10). <b>“His sister”; as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>“Afar off”; as it is written: “From afar YHWH appeared to me”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2). <b>“To know”; as it is written: “For YHWH is a God of knowledge”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>“What”; as it is written: “What does YHWH God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). <b>“Would be done”; as it is written: “For YHWH God will do nothing”</b> (Amos 3:7). <b>“To him”; as it is written: “And YHWH said to him: Peace</b> be with you” (Judges 6:23). |
| Deuteronomy 10:14 | Rabbi Yehuda said: There are two firmaments, as it is stated: “Behold, to the Lord your God belongs the heaven and the heaven of heavens” | Chagigah 12b:4 | § <b>R' Yehuda said: There are two firmaments, as it is stated: “Behold, to YHWH your God belongs the heaven and the heaven of heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:14), indicating that there is a heaven above our heaven. |
| Deuteronomy 10:16 | one’s heart, as it is written: “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of [ orlat ] your heart” | Shabbat 108a:7 | Karna also asked: <b>From where</b> is derived <b>that circumcision is</b> performed <b>in that place? </b> Rav answered him: <b>It is stated here, </b> with regard to circumcision: “And on the 8th day he shall circumcise the flesh of <b>his foreskin [<i>orlato</i>]</b>” (Leviticus 12:3), <b>and it is stated there, </b> with regard to recently planted trees: “And when you come to the land and plant all types of fruit trees, and you shall count the fruit <b>thereof as forbidden [<i>orlato</i>]; </b> three years shall it be as forbidden unto you, it shall not be eaten. ” (Leviticus 19:23). <b>Just as there</b> the Torah is referring to a tree, which <b>is an item that bears fruit, here, too, </b> in the case of circumcision, <i>orla</i> is referring to <b>an item that bears fruit. </b> He asked him: <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s heart, as it is written: “And you shall circumcise the foreskin of [<i>orlat</i>] your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16)? <b>Say</b> that circumcision should be performed on <b>one’s ear, as it is written: “Behold, their ear is dull [<i>areila</i>]</b> and they cannot listen” (Jeremiah 6:10)? Rav said to him: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> another instance of the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i>; and one does not derive</b> the <b>complete</b> form <b><i>orlato</i> from</b> the <b>incomplete</b> form <b><i>orlat, </i></b> which modifies another word, as is also the case with the word <i>areila</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 10:16 | Moses called it uncircumcised, as it is stated: “And circumcise the foreskin of your hearts” | Sukkah 52a:7 | § <b>R' Avira, and some say R' Yehoshua ben Levi, taught: The evil inclination has seven names. God called it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Moses called it uncircumcised, as it is stated: “And circumcise the foreskin of your hearts”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:16). <b>David called it impure, as it is stated: “Create for me a pure heart, O God”</b> (Psalms 51:12); <b>by inference, there is an impure</b> heart that is the evil inclination. |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | who favors no one and takes no bribe” | Berakhot 20b:15 | After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Talmud cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>R' Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>R' Asi: The ministering angels said before God: God!, in Your Torah it is written: </b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You, </b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “YHWH shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless YHWH until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk. </b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor. |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | had Moses our teacher not written them in the Torah | Megillah 25a:8 | When he finished, R' Ḥanina <b>said to him: Have you concluded</b> all of <b>the praises of your Master? Even these three</b> praises <b>that we recite: </b> The great, the mighty, and the awesome, <b>had Moses our teacher not written them in the Torah</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and had the members of the Great Assembly not come and incorporated them</b> into the <i>Amida</i> prayer (see Nehemiah 9:32), <b>we would not</b> be permitted to <b>recite them. And you went on and recited all of these. It is comparable to a man who possessed many thousands of golden dinars, yet they were praising him for</b> owning <b>a thousand silver</b> ones. <b>Isn’t that deprecatory toward him? </b> All of the praises one can lavish upon YHWH are nothing but a few silver dinars relative to many thousands of gold dinars. Reciting a litany of praise does not enhance God’s honor. |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | It is written in the Torah: “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords” | Megillah 31a:13 | <b>It is written in the Torah: “For YHWH your God is the God of gods and YHWH of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets: </b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: </b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, </b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a 3rd time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is YHWH”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6). |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | Who shows no favor nor takes graft” | Niddah 70b:5 | The rabbis of Alexandria also asked the following: <b>One verse states: “For</b> YHWH your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awful, <b>Who shows no favor nor takes graft”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and one verse states: “YHWH shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). How can this contradiction be resolved? R' Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here, </b> the verse in Numbers is dealing with the time <b>before</b> one’s <b>sentence</b> is issued, when God shows favor and forgives; <b>there, </b> the verse in Deuteronomy is referring to <b>after</b> the <b>sentence</b> has been issued, when He no longer forgives. |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | who favors no one” | Rosh Hashanah17b:17 | The Talmud continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Beloreya the convert</b> once <b>asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah: </b> “The great, mighty, and awesome God <b>who favors no one”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “YHWH shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6: 26). How can this contradiction be resolved? |
| Deuteronomy 10:17 | “The great, the mighty, and the awesomeGod” | Yoma 69b:14 | The Talmud comments: <b>This</b> interpretation that <b>Rav Mattana</b> said <b>leans to, </b> i.e., is consonant with, the exposition <b>of R' Yehoshua ben Levi. As R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: Why are</b> the rabbis of those generations <b>called the members of the Great Assembly? </b> It is <b>because they returned the crown</b> of God, <b>to its former</b> glory. How so? <b>Moses came</b> and <b>said</b> in his prayer: <b>“The great, the mighty, and the awesomeGod”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17). <b>Jeremiah</b> the prophet <b>came and said: non-Jews, </b> i.e., the minions of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>are carousing in His sanctuary; where is His awesomeness? </b> Therefore, <b>he did not say awesome</b> in his prayer: “The great God, the mighty Lord of Hosts, is His name” (Jeremiah 32:18). <b>Daniel came</b> and <b>said: non-Jews are enslaving His children; where is His might? </b> Therefore <b>he did not say mighty</b> in his prayer: “The great and awesome God” (Daniel 9:4). |
| Deuteronomy 10:18 | afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow” | Megillah 31a:13 | <b>It is written in the Torah: “For YHWH your God is the God of gods and YHWH of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets: </b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: </b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, </b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a 3rd time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is YHWH”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6). |
| Deuteronomy 10:20 | “You shall be in awe of [ et ] the Lord your God; | Pesachim 22b:11 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmmassoni, and some say</b> that <b>it</b> was <b>Neḥemya HaAmmassoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b><i>et</i> in the Torah, </b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall be in awe of [<i>et</i>] YHWH your God; </b> you shall serve Him; and to Him you shall cleave, and by His name you shall swear” (Deuteronomy 10:20), <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as how could one add to God Himself? <b>His students said to him: R', what will be with all the <i>etim</i> that you interpreted</b> until now? <b>He said to them: Just as I received reward for the interpretation, so I shall receive reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition. The word <i>et</i> in this verse was not explained <b>until R' Akiva came and expounded: “You shall be in awe of [<i>et</i>] YHWH your God”: </b> The word <i>et</i> comes <b>to include Torah scholars, </b> and one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any case, Shimon HaAmmassoni no longer derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from the word <i>et</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 10:20 | and to Him you shall cleave, and by His name you shall swear” | Temurah 3b:18 | The Talmud asks: Isn’t <b>that</b> verse <b>required</b> as a source <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav? As Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is permitted for one to <b>take an oath</b> obligating himself <b>to fulfill the mitzvot? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). The Talmud counters that there is another source: <b>Isn’t another verse written: </b> “You shall fear YHWH your God; Him you shall serve; <b>and to Him you shall cleave, and by His name you shall swear”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:20). This second verse teaches that it is permitted for one to take a truthful oath. |
| Deuteronomy 11:6 | and all the sustenance that was at their feet” | Pesachim 119a:12 | With regard to Korah’s wealth, the Talmud cites the verse: <b>“Riches kept by his owner to his hurt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:12). <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish said: This is the wealth of Korah, </b> which caused him to grow arrogant and lead to his destruction. <b>As it is stated: </b> “And what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, <b>and all the sustenance that was at their feet”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:6). <b>R' Elazar said: This</b> is referring to <b>a person’s money that stands him upon his</b> own two <b>feet. R' Levi said: The keys to Korah’s treasuries were</b> a <b>load of three hundred</b> strong <b>white mules, and they were all keys [<i>aklidei</i>] and locks</b> made <b>of leather. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:6 | “And all the substance that was at their feet” | Sanhedrin 110a:11 | § With regard to the verse: <b>“Wealth is kept for the owner to his detriment”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:12), <b>Reish Lakish says: This</b> is referring to <b>the wealth of Korah, </b> which was of no use to him. The fact that Korah was wealthy is derived from the verse: <b>“And all the substance that was at their feet”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:6), as <b>R' Elazar says: This</b> is referring to <b>a person’s property, which stands him on his feet. And R' Levi says: The keys</b> alone <b>to Korah’s treasury were a burden</b> requiring <b>three hundred white mules</b> to transport them, <b>and</b> moreover, <b>all the keys [<i>aklidei</i>] and locks were of leather. </b> This conveys the vastness of his wealth. |
| Deuteronomy 11:10 | Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And you water it with your foot like a garden of herbs” | Shabbat 85a:3 | With regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself, <b>Rav Asi said: </b> The <b>garden bed</b> in the Mishnah whose area is six by six handbreadths is one whose <b>internal</b> area <b>is six</b> by six handbreadths <b>excluding</b> the area of <b>its boundaries, </b> which must be added to the total area. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The internal</b> area <b>of a garden bed is six</b> by six handbreadths. The Talmud asks: <b>How much</b> is the size of <b>its boundaries? </b> The Talmud answers, <b>as we learned</b> in a Mishnah that <b>R' Yehuda says: </b> The <b>width</b> of the border <b>is like the width of a foot. </b> And <b>R' Zeira said, and some say</b> it was <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa</b> who <b>said: What is the reason</b> for the statement of <b>R' Yehuda? As it is written: “And you water it with your foot like a garden of herbs”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:10), meaning that <b>just as</b> one’s <b>foot is a handbreadth</b> wide, <b>so too, the boundary</b> between garden beds where one walks to water plants <b>is also a handbreadth</b> wide. |
| Deuteronomy 11:11 | which it is written: “And drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down” | Bava Batra19a:18 | The Talmud further challenges: The Mishnah teaches that one must distance <b>a plow; but</b> let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow <b>due to</b> the requirement to distance the <b>seeds, </b> as plowing is preparation for planting. The Talmud answers: This is referring <b>to one who plows</b> to prepare the ground <b>for trees. </b> The Talmud challenges: <b>But</b> if so, let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow due to the requirement to distance the <b>water. </b> If there are trees, there must be a water channel to irrigate them, and arranging one’s field in such a manner should be prohibited for that reason. The Talmud answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is referring to Eretz Yisrael, </b> concerning <b>which it is written: “And drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:11). In Eretz Yisrael, water channels were not needed. |
| Deuteronomy 11:11 | Rabbi Yehoshua says: The entire world drinks from the upper waters, as it is stated: “And it drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down” | Taanit 9b:11 | In contrast, <b>R' Yehoshua says: The entire world drinks from the upper waters, as it is stated: “And it drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:11). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of R' Yehoshua, <b>how do I uphold</b> the verse: <b>“And there went up a mist from the earth”? </b> R' Yehoshua could answer that this verse <b>teaches that the clouds grow stronger, and rise to the firmament, and open their mouths like</b> a leather <b>bottle, and receive the rain waters</b> from above, <b>as it is stated: </b> “For He draws away the drops of water, <b>which distill rain from His vapor”</b> (Job 36:27). |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year” | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream. </b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Talmud enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of YHWH as the watercourses: </b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of YHWH, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written: </b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | at its beginning will be made rich at its end, for it is stated: “From the beginning [ mereishit ] of the year” | Rosh Hashanah16b:3 | § The Talmud brings a series of statements in the name of R' Yitzḥak, all of which relate to judgment: <b>And R' Yitzḥak said: Any year that is poor [<i>rasha</i>]</b> and troubled <b>at its beginning will be made rich at its end, for it is stated: “From the beginning [<i>mereishit</i>] of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The word <b><i>meireishit</i> is written</b> defectively, without an <i>alef</i>, so that it may also be understood in the sense of <i>rashut</i>, poverty. The verse continues: <b>“And until the end [<i>aḥarit</i>]</b> of the year,” which means <b>that the end</b> of the year <b>will have</b> expectations of good things <b>in the end [<i>aḥarit</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | upon it” | Rosh Hashanah17b:11 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “A land which YHWH your God cares for; <b>the eyes of YHWH your God are</b> always <b>upon it”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). God’s constant providence over Eretz Yisrael is <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>good</b> and <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>bad. Sometimes for</b> the <b>good; how so? If the Jews were wholly wicked on Rosh HaShana, so that</b> only <b>a meager</b> amount of <b>rain was decreed for them</b> for the year, but <b>in the end they repented, </b> what can be done? <b>To add</b> rain <b>is impossible, as the decree was already issued. Rather, God causes</b> those sparse rains <b>to fall at the</b> appropriate <b>times on land that needs it, </b> e.g., fields, vineyards, and gardens, <b>all according to</b> requirements of <b>the land, </b> and those rains are just as effective as a lot of rain. |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | “From the beginning of the year” | Rosh Hashanah7a:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>But let us learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and a different instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The Talmud answers: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which “months”</b> are mentioned, as the verse states: “Throughout the months of the year,” <b>from</b> another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which months</b> are mentioned, as the verse states: “It shall be the first month of the year to you. ” <b>And one does not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which months</b> are mentioned <b>from</b> an instance of the word <b>“year”</b> together <b>with which “months”</b> are not mentioned, as the verse states: “From the beginning of the year. ” |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | from the beginning of the year until the end of the year” | Rosh Hashanah8a:16 | § <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> When the Mishnah says that the first of Tishrei is the New Year for years, it is <b>with regard to judgment, </b> as on that day God judges the world for the whole year, <b>as it is written: </b> “A land that YHWH your God cares for; the eyes of YHWH your God are always upon it, <b>from the beginning of the year until the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12); <b>from the beginning of the year judgment is passed as to what will happen at the end</b> of the year. |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | from Tishrei, as it is written: “From the beginning of the year” | Rosh Hashanah8b:6 | § The Mishnah teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “But in the 7th year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land”</b> (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> we <b>learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written: “From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The latter verse is referring to the year that begins at the onset of the winter, i.e., Tishrei. |
| Deuteronomy 11:12 | “From the beginning of the year” | Rosh Hashanah9b:11 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the New Year <b>for planting. </b> It determines the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “Three years</b> shall it be <b>prohibited [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“And in the 4th year</b> all its fruit will be sacred for giving praise to YHWH” (Leviticus 19:24). <b>And</b> it is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Tishrei, as it is written</b> with regard to Tishrei: <b>“From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). |
| Deuteronomy 11:13 | “To love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart” | Taanit 2a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that rain must be mentioned specifically <b>in</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“To love YHWH your God and to serve Him with all your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13). <b>Which is the service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>in the heart? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>prayer. And, afterward, it is written: “And I shall give the rain of your land in its due time, the first rain and the last rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). This juxtaposition teaches that it is appropriate to request rain while engaged in the service of the heart, i.e., prayer. |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain, | Berakhot 35b:4 | On a similar note, the Talmud cites that <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction: It is written, “I will take back My grain at its time</b> and wine in its season” (Hosea 2:11), <b>and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain, </b> your wine and your oil” (Deuteronomy 11:14). To whom does the grain belong: To God, or to the people? |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | prayer. And, afterward, it is written: “And I shall give the rain of your land in its due time, the first rain and the last rain” | Taanit 2a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that rain must be mentioned specifically <b>in</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“To love YHWH your God and to serve Him with all your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13). <b>Which is the service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>in the heart? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>prayer. And, afterward, it is written: “And I shall give the rain of your land in its due time, the first rain and the last rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). This juxtaposition teaches that it is appropriate to request rain while engaged in the service of the heart, i.e., prayer. |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | the verse states: “Last rain [ malkosh ]” | Taanit 6a:3 | <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>that is not</b> the case; rather, <b><i>yoreh</i></b> means <b>that</b> the rain <b>causes the fruit to drop</b> from the trees, <b>washes the seeds</b> away, <b>and washes the trees</b> away in a destructive manner. According to this interpretation, <i>yoreh</i> is related to <i>yeriya</i>, shooting. Therefore <b>the verse states: “Last rain [<i>malkosh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14); <b>just as <i>malkosh</i></b> refers specifically to rains that are <b>for a blessing, so too, <i>yoreh</i></b> is referring to rains that are <b>for a blessing. Or</b> perhaps <b>that is not</b> the case; rather, <b><i>malkosh</i></b> means <b>that</b> the rain falls so hard [<i>kashe</i>] and vehemently that <b>it knocks down the houses, shatters the trees and brings up the locusts? </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “<i>Yoreh</i>, ”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>just as <i>yoreh</i> is for a blessing, so too, <i>malkosh</i></b> is <b>for a blessing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | in its due time” | Taanit 6a:5 | The Talmud cites another <i>baraita</i> on the same topic. <b>A baraita states: </b> The <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan. </b> Do <b>you say</b> that the <b>first rain is in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> that the <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Tishrei and</b> the <b>last rain in Iyyar? </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “I shall give the rain of your land <b>in its due time”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). Its due time is in Marḥeshvan, when rain is needed for the crops to sprout, and in Nisan, to complete the growth of the crops. |
| Deuteronomy 11:14 | in its due time, the first rain and the last rain” | Taanit 6a:7 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan. </b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>the first rain is in Marḥeshvan, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only in</b> the month of <b>Kislev? The verse states: </b> “I shall give the rain of your land <b>in its due time, the first rain and the last rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). <b>Just as</b> the <b>last rain</b> falls <b>in its due time, so too, </b> the <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in its due time. </b> And, <b>as</b> previously stated, <b>once Nisan has ended and</b> the <b>rains</b> subsequently <b>fall, </b> this <b>is not a sign of a blessing, </b> but a curse. Likewise, Marḥeshvan is the best time for the first rains to fall. |
| Deuteronomy 11:15 | then: “And you shall eat and be satisfied” | Berakhot 40a:1 | Continuing to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of breaking bread, <b>Rav said: </b> One who broke bread, and before eating it, offered a piece to another, and said: <b>Take</b> it and <b>recite a blessing, take</b> it and <b>recite a blessing, need not recite the blessing</b> a second time, because that is considered to have been for the purpose of the blessing. If, however, he said: <b>Bring salt or bring relish, he must recite the blessing</b> a second time, as that is considered an interruption between the blessing and eating the bread. <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if he said: <b>Bring salt</b> or <b>bring relish, </b> it is not considered an interruption <b>and he need not recite the blessing</b> a second time. Only if he said: <b>Mix</b> the food <b>for the oxen, mix</b> the food <b>for the oxen, </b> it is considered an interruption <b>and he is required to recite the blessing</b> a second time. <b>And Rav Sheshet said: Even</b> if he said: <b>Mix for the oxen, he need not recite a blessing</b> a second time, as that is also considered to be for the purpose of the blessing, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One is prohibited from eating before feeding his animals, as it is stated: “And I will give grass in your fields for your animals”</b> first <b>and</b> only <b>then: “And you shall eat and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:15). In the verse, preparation of food for one’s cattle precedes preparation of his own food. Consequently, it is considered part of the preparation for one’s own meal. |
| Deuteronomy 11:15 | “And I will give grass in the field for your animals” | Gittin 62a:16 | Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Geneiva: <b>Does the Master wish to taste something? </b> Geneiva <b>said to them: So says Rav Yehuda</b> that <b>Rav says: It is prohibited for a person to taste anything until he gives food to his animal, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And I will give grass in the field for your animals”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:15), <b>and</b> only <b>afterward</b> is it written in that verse: <b>“And you shall eat and be satisfied. ”</b> I have yet to feed my animal, so I may not eat. |
| Deuteronomy 11:17 | “And He will close up the heavens” | Taanit 3b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> are <b>they not withheld? But didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17), means that God will stop up the heavens <b>from the clouds and from the winds? </b> Do <b>you say</b> that “close up the heavens” means <b>from the clouds and from the winds, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> referring to the absence <b>of rainfall? When</b> the same verse <b>says: “So that there will be no rain, ” rain is</b> already <b>mentioned</b> explicitly. <b>How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And He will close up the heavens”? </b> This must mean <b>from the clouds and from the winds. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:17 | “And He will close up | Taanit 6b:8 | <b>And R' Abbahu</b> further <b>said: </b> For rainfall to be considered the <b>first rainfall</b> it must be <b>sufficient to enter the ground</b> and saturate it to a depth of one <b>handbreadth. </b> The <b>second</b> rainfall must be <b>sufficient</b> that the soil is moistened enough <b>to seal the opening of a jug with its</b> mud. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Rains which fall</b> and create <b>sufficient</b> mud <b>to seal the opening of a jug with them</b> means that the year <b>does not constitute</b> a fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And He will close up</b> the heavens and there will be no rain” (Deuteronomy 11:17). |
| Deuteronomy 11:17 | and you will perish quickly” | Taanit 7b:5 | <b>R' Tanḥum ben Ḥiyya of the village of Akko, said: The rains are withheld only if the enemies of the Jewish people, </b> a euphemism for the Jewish people, <b>have been sentenced to destruction</b> for their sins, <b>as it is stated: “Drought and heat will steal the snow waters; to the grave those who have sinned”</b> (Job 24:19). According to this interpretation, snow water will be stolen by drought, i.e., there will be none available, when people have sinned to the point that they deserve the grave. <b>Ze’iri from Dihavat said to Ravina: You learned this</b> idea <b>from here; we learned it from here: </b> “And the anger of YHWH will be kindled against you, <b>and He will close up the heavens, </b> and there will be no rain, and the earth will not give its fruit, <b>and you will perish quickly”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17). |
| Deuteronomy 11:17 | which is written: “And He will close up the heavens” | Taanit 8a:18 | § Returning to the topic of rain, <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17)? This verse teaches that <b>when the heavens are closed up from bringing down dew and rain, </b> this is <b>similar to a woman who has the pangs of labor and</b> yet <b>does not give birth, </b> as the heavens themselves suffer from their inability to bring down rain and dew. <b>And this is what Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Kappara: Closing up is stated with regard to rains, and closing up is</b> likewise <b>stated with regard to a woman. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:17 | and closing up is stated with regard to rains, as it is written: “And He will close up the heavens” | Taanit 8b:1 | Reish Lakish elaborates: <b>Closing up is stated with regard to a woman</b> who cannot give birth, <b>as it is stated: “For YHWH has fast closed up all the wombs”</b> (Genesis 20:18), <b>and closing up is stated with regard to rains, as it is written: “And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17). |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them | Berakhot 14b:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform? |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | The Sages taught: “And you shall place [ vesamtem ] | Kiddushin 30b:3 | <b>A baraita states: “And you shall place [<i>vesamtem</i>]</b> these words of Mine in your hearts” (Deuteronomy 11:18). Read this as though it stated <b><i>sam tam</i>, a perfect elixir. The Torah is compared to an elixir of life. </b> There is <b>a parable that</b> illustrates this: <b>A person hit his son with a strong blow and placed a bandage on his wound. And he said to him: My son, as long as this bandage is on your wound</b> and is healing you, <b>eat what you enjoy and drink what you enjoy, and bathe in either hot water or cold water, and you do not need to be afraid, </b> as it will heal your wound. <b>But if you take it off, </b> the wound <b>will become gangrenous. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | from phylacteries, | Kiddushin 36a:9 | <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is Isi’s reason, as he derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“between your eyes”</b> with regard to baldness <b>from tefillin, </b> concerning which it says: “And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18): <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to tefillin, <b>women are exempt, so too here, </b> in the case of baldness, <b>women are exempt. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rava did not state</b> the same reason <b>as Abaye? </b> The Talmud answers: Rava <b>does not learn</b> anything from the distinction between <b><i>keraḥ</i></b> and <b><i>korḥa</i>, </b> as he maintains that no <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this slight difference in language. |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | for totafot | Menachot 34b:1 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the number of compartments in the tefillin of the head, the verse states: “It shall be for a sign upon your hand, and <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), with the word <i>totafot</i> spelled deficient, without a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a way that can be read as singular; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), spelled as a singular word; and again: “They shall be <b>for <i>totafot</i></b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18), this time spelled plene, with a <i>vav</i> before the final letter, in a manner that must be plural. <b>There are four</b> mentions of <i>totafot</i> <b>here, </b> as the 3rd one is written in the plural and therefore counts as two. Consequently, it is derived that the tefillin of the head must have four compartments. This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | and you shall bind them” | Menachot 37b:3 | <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And it shall be for a sign for you</b> upon your arm” (Exodus 13:9), which teaches: It shall be <b>a sign for you, but not a sign for others, </b> i.e., one must don the tefillin of the arm in a place where they are not seen by others. This is the arm, which is usually covered, whereas the hand is usually visible. <b>R' Yitzḥak says: </b> This proof is <b>not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “Therefore you shall place these words in your heart</b> and in your soul, <b>and you shall bind them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:18). This teaches <b>that placing</b> the words, i.e., donning the tefillin, <b>shall be opposite the heart, </b> on the bicep. |
| Deuteronomy 11:18 | for frontlets [ totafot ] | Zevachim 37b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>But if that is so, </b> that this is the proper manner of expounding the verses, consider the case of the tefillin of the head, about which it is stated: “And <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), and: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and subsequently: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18). The word <i>totafot</i> is written once in plene form, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, and twice in a deficient form, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, indicating the singular. Accordingly, <b>there are four</b> frontlets <b>here, </b> and from here the rabbis derive that the tefillin of the head consist of four compartments, which together form a cube. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text, </b> read in the plural, <b>is effective, </b> i.e., that it requires six compartments, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text, </b> read in the singular, <b>is effective, </b> i.e., it requires four compartments, and therefore one should be <b>required to prepare five compartments</b> for the tefillin of the head? |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | “And you shall teach them [ otam ] | Bava Batra21a:2 | What was this ordinance? <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Truly, that man is remembered for the good, and his name is Yehoshua ben Gamla. If not for him</b> the <b>Torah would have been forgotten from the Jewish people. Initially, whoever had a father</b> would have his father <b>teach him Torah, </b> and <b>whoever did not have a father would not learn Torah</b> at all. The Talmud explains: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret homiletically</b> that allowed them to conduct themselves in this manner? They interpreted the verse that states: <b>“And you shall teach them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to your sons” (Deuteronomy 11:19), to mean: <b>And you yourselves [<i>atem</i>] shall teach, </b> i.e., you fathers shall teach your sons. |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | to speak of them” | Berakhot 13b:5 | At first the Talmud understands that Rav Zutra required recitation only in the second paragraph, while in the first paragraph only intent was required. Therefore, the Talmud asks: <b>What is different, </b> that <b>from here on, </b> beginning with the second paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of recitation? </b> Is it because <b>it is written: </b> “And you shall teach them to your children, <b>to speak of them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19)? This is no proof, as <b>here too, </b> in the first paragraph <b>it is written: “And you shall speak of them. ”</b> The mitzva of recitation applies to the first paragraph as well. |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | “And you shall teach them [ velimadtem ] | Berakhot 15b:27 | On a similar note: <b>Rav Ovadya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava: </b> That which was stated: <b>“And you shall teach them [<i>velimadtem</i>]</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 11:19) teaches that <b>your teaching must be complete [<i>tam</i>] that one</b> should <b>leave space between adjacent</b> words, where the last letter of the first and the first letter of the second are identical. One must distinguish between the words and enunciate each one clearly. |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | As the verse states: “And you shall teach them to your sons” | Kiddushin 29b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that she is not obligated to teach herself? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach [<i>velimadtem</i>], ”</b> which can be read as: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>], </b> which indicates that <b>whoever others are commanded to teach is commanded to teach himself, and whoever others are not commanded to teach is not commanded to teach himself. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that others are not commanded to teach</b> a woman? <b>As the verse states: “And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), which emphasizes: <b>Your sons and not your daughters. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | As it is written: “And you shall teach them [ velimadtem ] to your sons” | Kiddushin 29b:8 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>Torah. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this requirement? <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach them [<i>velimadtem</i>] to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19). <b>And</b> in a case <b>where his father did not teach him he is obligated to teach himself, as it is written, </b> i.e., the verse can be read with a different vocalization: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | “And you shall teach them to your sons” | Kiddushin 30a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But is one’s father’s father obligated</b> to teach him Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), indicates: <b>But not your sons’ sons? And how do I realize, </b> i.e., understand, the meaning of the verse: <b>“But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9)? This serves <b>to say to you</b> that <b>whoever teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he taught him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the end of all generations. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | the verse states: “Your sons” | Kiddushin 30a:6 | The Talmud answers that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: From the verse <b>“And you shall teach them to your sons” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that you must teach <b>your sons. From where do</b> I derive that there is an obligation to teach <b>your sons’ sons? The verse states: “But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons. ” If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), which implies only sons? This limitation teaches: <b>Your sons, but not your daughters. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:19 | before the one preceding it. | Shabbat 32b:4 | On the same topic, <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba and R' Yosei disagree. One said</b> that children die <b>due to the sin of</b> not affixing a <b><i>mezuza</i></b> to one’s doorpost. <b>And one said</b> children die <b>due to the sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah. According to the one who said</b> that children die <b>because of the sin of</b> not affixing a <b><i>mezuza</i>, </b> his opinion there is based on an exegetical principle, which states that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it and not</b> on juxtaposition to the verse <b>before the one preceding it. </b> In this case, it says: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children” (Deuteronomy 11:21), and the preceding verse says: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates” (Deuteronomy 11:20). <b>And according to the one who said</b> that children die due to <b>the sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, </b> that is because in his opinion the exegetical principle is that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it, as well as</b> to the verse <b>before the one preceding it. </b> In his opinion, the blessing of long life also relates to the verse before the one immediately preceding it: “And you shall teach them your children, talking of them” (Deuteronomy 11:19). |
| Deuteronomy 11:20 | a mezuza | Kiddushin 34a:2 | <b>And what is a positive mitzva that is not time bound? </b> Examples include the affixing of <b>a <i>mezuza</i></b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), the construction of <b>a parapet</b> on a roof (Deuteronomy 22:8), returning <b>a lost item</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1–3), <b>and the release</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest, </b> i.e., the mitzva of sending away a mother bird when one finds it sitting on chicks or eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6–7). |
| Deuteronomy 11:20 | two. When it says “doorposts” in the second passage | Menachot 34a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of R' Meir, </b> that one doorpost suffices to obligate one to affix a <i>mezuza</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When it states <b>“doorposts”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), <b>I</b> would <b>derive the minimum</b> number <b>of doorposts, </b> which is <b>two. When it says “doorposts” in the second passage</b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), this also serves to teach a <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> otherwise there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. This <b>is</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that <b>an amplification following an amplification is</b> stated <b>only</b> in order <b>to restrict</b> its extent. In this manner <b>the verse restricted</b> the minimum number <b>to one doorpost. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:20 | “And you shall write them | Menachot 44a:19 | <b>Anyone who does not have a <i>mezuza</i> in his doorway violates two positive mitzvot, </b> stated in the verses: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), and: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 11:20). |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons [ beneikhem ]” | Bava Batra110b:7 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here, </b> in the passage in the Torah addressing the inheritance of slaves, which states: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your sons [<i>livneikhem</i>] after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). One can infer: <b>“Your sons, ” but not your daughters. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>If that is so, </b> then when the verse states: <b>“That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons [<i>beneikhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21), should one infer that <b>this too</b> means: <b>“Your sons, ” but not your daughters? </b> Is it not obvious that daughters are also worthy of receiving the blessing of longevity? |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | begin: “In order to lengthen your days” | Berakhot 16a:5 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said to him: They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one did not</b> yet <b>begin: “In order to lengthen your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21) which follows that verse at the end of the second paragraph. <b>However, if he</b> already <b>began</b> to recite: <b>In order to lengthen your days, </b> he can assume that <b>he assumed his routine and continued</b> and completed the second paragraph. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land | Berakhot 8a:6 | The Talmud relates that when the rabbis <b>told R' Yoḥanan</b> that <b>there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land</b> YHWH swore to your forefathers to give to them like the days of heaven on the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21); lengthened in Eretz Yisrael <b>but not outside of the Land. </b> Why then, do the residents of Babylonia live long lives? <b>When they told him</b> that the people in Babylonia <b>go early</b> in the morning <b>and go late</b> in the evening <b>to the synagogue, he said: That is what was effective for them</b> in extending their lives. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | “So that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children” | Chullin 135b:15 | Likewise, with regard to <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, </b> R' Ilai concedes that the house of two partners is obligated, <b>even though it is written: </b> “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of <b>your house [<i>beitekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), with a singular pronoun, from which one might have inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> house, <b>yes, </b> it is obligated, whereas a house owned by two people <b>in partnership</b> is <b>not</b> obligated. Consequently, <b>God writes</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“So that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). The use of the plural pronoun in the terms “your days” and “your children” in this verse indicates that partners are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term <b>“your house [<i>beitekha</i>]” come? </b> The Talmud answers: It is necessary <b>for that which Rabba</b> derived, <b>as Rabba said: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | “That your days may be multiplied” | Kiddushin 34a:8 | The Talmud says: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let us juxtapose <i>mezuza</i> to Torah study</b> and say that women are also exempt from the obligation of a <i>mezuza</i>. The Talmud rejects this suggestion: This <b>could not enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“That your days may be multiplied”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). Can it be said that <b>men need life</b> but <b>women do not need life? </b> Since the reward for the performance of the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> is extended life, this mitzva applies to women as well. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | al ha’aretz , | Menachot 31b:7 | § <b>Rav Ḥisda says: </b> One writes the last two words of a <i>mezuza</i>, <b><i>al ha’aretz</i>, </b> meaning “above the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21), by themselves <b>on the final line, </b> without the preceding word. The rabbis disagreed as to how this is done. <b>Some say</b> that one writes this phrase <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line, and some say</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | that the Lord took an oath to your forefathers to give them” | Sanhedrin 90b:12 | This exchange continued <b>until</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>stated to them this verse: </b> “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land <b>that YHWH took an oath to your forefathers to give them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). The phrase: <b>To</b> give <b>you, is not stated; rather, </b> it is stated: <b>“To</b> give <b>them, ”</b> to the Patriarchs themselves, as in the future the Patriarchs will come to life and inherit the land. <b>From here resurrection of the dead</b> is derived <b>from the Torah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | as the days of heaven upon the earth” | Sanhedrin 99a:10 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: </b> The duration of <b>the messianic era is like</b> the duration of the period that runs <b>from the day the world was created until now, </b> i.e., the day when the Messiah will come, <b>as it is stated: </b> “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land that YHWH swore to your fathers to give them, <b>as the days of heaven upon the earth”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | “So that your days and the days of your children will multiply | Shabbat 105b:11 | <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba raised an objection to R' Yoḥanan: </b> It is stated: <b>“And the nation worshipped YHWH all the days of Joshua and all the days of the Elders, who lived many days after Joshua”</b> (Judges 2:7), indicating that the Elders lived long lives even though they did not eulogize Joshua properly. R' Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Babylonian, </b> you should be more precise in your reading. They indeed lived <b>many days; </b> however, they did <b>not</b> live <b>many years. </b> In fact, they did not live to the end of that year. Again he asked: <b>But then</b> with regard to the verse <b>“So that your days and the days of your children will multiply</b> on the land which YHWH your God swore to give to your fathers, as the days of the heavens over the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21), would you also say that here the reward is to live many <b>days but not years? </b> He answered him: <b>A blessing is different</b> and should be interpreted in its most expansive sense. |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | before the one preceding it. | Shabbat 32b:4 | On the same topic, <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba and R' Yosei disagree. One said</b> that children die <b>due to the sin of</b> not affixing a <b><i>mezuza</i></b> to one’s doorpost. <b>And one said</b> children die <b>due to the sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah. According to the one who said</b> that children die <b>because of the sin of</b> not affixing a <b><i>mezuza</i>, </b> his opinion there is based on an exegetical principle, which states that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it and not</b> on juxtaposition to the verse <b>before the one preceding it. </b> In this case, it says: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children” (Deuteronomy 11:21), and the preceding verse says: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates” (Deuteronomy 11:20). <b>And according to the one who said</b> that children die due to <b>the sin of dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, </b> that is because in his opinion the exegetical principle is that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it, as well as</b> to the verse <b>before the one preceding it. </b> In his opinion, the blessing of long life also relates to the verse before the one immediately preceding it: “And you shall teach them your children, talking of them” (Deuteronomy 11:19). |
| Deuteronomy 11:21 | the verse states: “So that your days be numerous, as well as the days of your sons” | Yoma 11b:8 | <b>And say</b> it is <b>indeed so</b> that a woman’s house and a jointly owned house are exempt. The Talmud rejects this possibility: Immediately following the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> is the reward for its fulfillment, as <b>the verse states: “So that your days be numerous, as well as the days of your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). If these structures were exempt from the mitzva, the question would arise: Do <b>these</b> men and individuals <b>require</b> long <b>life, and these, </b> meaning women and partners, <b>do not require</b> long <b>life? </b> The mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> clearly applies to all of them. |
| Deuteronomy 11:29 | The Sages taught: “And you shall give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse | Sotah 37b:10 | <b>A baraita states: “And you shall give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse</b> on Mount Ebal” (Deuteronomy 11:29). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the blessing must be</b> given <b>on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, it is already stated: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:12), <b>and it is written: “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13). <b>Rather, </b> the verse teaches that the proclamation of the <b>blessing must precede</b> the <b>curse. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:30 | Shechem, which is near the oaks of Moreh, as it is stated: “Are they not beyond the Jordan, | Sotah 32a:10 | <b>How</b> did the ceremony of the <b>blessings and curses</b> take place? <b>When the Jewish people crossed the Jordan River they came to Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, which are in Samaria alongside</b> the city of <b>Shechem, which is near the oaks of Moreh, as it is stated: “Are they not beyond the Jordan, </b> behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? ” (Deuteronomy 11:30), <b>and there it states: “And Abram passed through the land until the place of Shechem, until the oaks of Moreh”</b> (Genesis 12:6). <b>Just as the oaks of Moreh mentioned there</b> with regard to Abraham <b>are</b> close to <b>Shechem, so too, the oaks of Moreh mentioned here are</b> close to <b>Shechem. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 11:30 | When the Jewish people crossed the Jordan River, etc. The Sages taught: | Sotah 33b:4 | § It is stated in the Mishnah: <b>How</b> did the ceremony of the <b>blessings and curses</b> take place? <b>When the Jewish people crossed the Jordan River, etc. A baraita states: </b> When the Jewish people were in Transjordan, the location of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal was described to them as follows: “Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the coming of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? ” (Deuteronomy 11:30). <b>“Are they not beyond the Jordan”</b> means <b>farther</b> west, <b>beyond the Jordan</b> River; this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. “Behind the way of the coming of the sun”; </b> this is referring to <b>the place where the sun rises, </b> i.e., the east. In other words, they are at a distance from the Jordan River, which is in the east. |
| Deuteronomy 11:31 | “And you shall possess it and dwell there” | Kiddushin 26a:10 | § The Mishnah further teaches that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And dwell in your cities that you have taken”</b> (Jeremiah 40:10). <b>In what</b> manner <b>have you taken</b> these cities? They are taken <b>by dwelling, </b> which indicates that taking possession of a plot of land and dwelling there is an act demonstrating ownership, and it is itself a valid act of acquisition. A Sage from <b>the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> a different proof: <b>“And you shall possess it and dwell there”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:31). <b>How have you possessed</b> it? You have done so <b>by dwelling</b> there. This teaches that land can be acquired through an act that demonstrates ownership. |
| Deuteronomy 12:1 | as the Sages taught | Kiddushin 37a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud answers: This is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are the statutes and the ordinances that you shall observe to do in the land that YHWH, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live upon the earth” (Deuteronomy 12:1). This verse is interpreted as follows: The phrase <b>“these are the statutes”</b> means that <b>these are the expositions</b> that the rabbis learn from verses. With regard to the phrase <b>“and the ordinances, ” these are</b> monetary <b>laws. </b> With regard to <b>“that you shall observe, ” this is</b> referring to the <b>study</b> of matters that must be observed for one to perform them. And as for the phrase <b>“to do, ” this is</b> referring to <b>action, </b> the actual performance of mitzvot. |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says | Avodah Zarah45a:2 | <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says</b> with regard to the verse: “You shall destroy all the places where the nations that you are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree” (Deuteronomy 12:2): The mitzva to destroy objects of idol worship applies to <b>“their gods, upon the</b> high <b>mountains, ” but not</b> to <b>the mountains</b> themselves that are <b>their gods. </b> Similarly it applies to <b>“their gods…upon the hills, ” but not</b> to <b>the hills</b> themselves that are <b>their gods. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | forbidden. As it is taught | Avodah Zarah45b:3 | The Talmud notes: <b>And R' Yosei ben Yehuda, also holds</b> that <b>a tree that one planted and subsequently worshipped</b> is <b>forbidden. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “You shall destroy all the places where the nations that you are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree” (Deuteronomy 12:2): <b>R' Yosei ben Yehuda, says: From that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: “You shall destroy…<b>their gods, upon the</b> high <b>mountains, ”</b> from which the rabbis derived: <b>But not the mountains</b> themselves that are <b>their gods, </b> and: “You shall destroy…<b>their gods…upon the hills, ” but not</b> the <b>hills</b> themselves if they are <b>their gods, I</b> would <b>derive</b> from the next clause in the verse: <b>“Their gods…under every leafy tree, ”</b> that the mitzva to destroy an object of idol worship does <b>not</b> apply to the <b>leafy</b> trees themselves that are <b>their gods. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | Rabbi Akiva said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “You shall destroy” | Avodah Zarah46a:1 | <b>R' Akiva said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “You shall destroy”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2)? This obviously includes rooting out all traces of idols. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And you shall destroy their name out of that place”? </b> This means that it is a mitzva <b>to give it a nickname. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | mountains” | Avodah Zarah46b:4 | <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: Or</b> one can <b>reverse</b> the claim. <b>And if</b> an object that <b>was worshipped, which is forbidden in</b> a case where it is <b>detached</b> from the ground even <b>for</b> the use of <b>an ordinary</b> person, is yet <b>permitted</b> for use even <b>for</b> the <b>Most High in</b> a case where it is <b>attached</b> to the ground, <b>as it is stated</b> that the mitzva is to destroy: <b>“Their gods, upon the</b> high <b>mountains”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2), <b>but not the mountains</b> themselves that are <b>their gods, </b> and therefore with regard to such items, there <b>is no difference</b> between use <b>for an ordinary</b> person <b>and for</b> the <b>Most High; </b> concerning <b>payment</b> to a prostitute, <b>which is permitted</b> for use <b>for an ordinary</b> person <b>in</b> the case of <b>a detached</b> item, <b>is it not logical that</b> it should be <b>permitted</b> to use <b>for</b> the <b>Most High in</b> a case where the payment is an item <b>attached</b> to the ground? |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | served | Avodah Zarah51b:21 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>A non-Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>prohibited immediately, </b> i.e., as soon as it is fashioned for that purpose. The Talmud asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the Mishnah? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall destroy all the places, where the nations</b> that you are to dispossess <b>served</b> their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree” (Deuteronomy 12:2). <b>The verse is speaking of vessels that were used</b> by the non-Jews <b>for idol worship. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | served | Avodah Zarah51b:22 | One <b>might</b> have thought that the vessels are prohibited even if the non-Jews <b>fashioned them but did not complete them, completed them but did not bring them</b> to the idol, or <b>brought them</b> to the idol <b>but did not use them</b> for idolatrous worship. <b>Might</b> one have thought that in these cases the vessels <b>are prohibited? The verse states: “Where the nations</b> that you are to dispossess <b>served</b> their gods” (Deuteronomy 12:2). This indicates <b>that</b> the vessels <b>are not prohibited until they are</b> used for <b>worship. </b> It is <b>from here</b> that the rabbis <b>stated: A non-Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship is not prohibited until it is worshipped, but a Jew’s</b> object of idol worship <b>is prohibited immediately. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | the places” | Avodah Zarah51b:24 | <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>The verse is speaking of vessels that were used</b> by the non-Jews <b>for idol worship. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>written</b> “You shall destroy all <b>the places”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2), indicating that the verse is not referring to vessels? The Talmud answers: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in this verse <b>is not</b> applicable for the <b>matter of places</b> that were worshipped, it must apply to another matter. The verse cannot apply to the places themselves, <b>as they are not rendered prohibited, as it is written: </b> “You shall destroy…<b>their gods, upon the</b> high <b>mountains”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2), indicating that one is <b>not</b> required to destroy <b>the mountains</b> that are themselves <b>their gods. </b> Something that is attached to the ground is not rendered forbidden, and therefore even if idol worshippers worshipped the mountain itself it does not need to be destroyed. |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | their gods” | Avodah Zarah52a:2 | The Talmud questions how the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an object of idol worship is derived from this verse. <b>But didn’t we interpret this</b> verse as being stated <b>with regard to vessels</b> used in idolatrous worship, and not to an object of idol worship? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: </b> “You shall destroy all the places, where the nations <b>that you are to dispossess</b> served <b>their gods”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2). The verse <b>juxtaposes “their gods” to</b> “the places,” i.e., the <b>vessels</b> used to serve them. <b>Just as</b> the <b>vessels</b> are not forbidden <b>until they are</b> used for <b>worship, so too their gods, </b> the idols, are <b>also</b> not forbidden <b>until they are worshipped. And R' Akiva, who does not</b> consider the terms <b>juxtaposed, </b> he could <b>say to you</b> that the word <b>“<i>et</i>, ”</b> written in the verse before the term “their gods,” <b>separates the matter</b> of their gods from the matter of the vessels. |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | “Their gods, upon the high mountains” | Chullin 16a:6 | § Apropos the issue of slaughter with a detached blade, <b>Rava said: </b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that concerning an item that was <b>detached and ultimately one attached it, </b> with regard <b>to the matter of idol worship</b> its halakhic status <b>is</b> that of <b>a detached</b> item, <b>as the Master says: One who bows to his house has rendered it forbidden</b> as an object of idol worship. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that its halakhic status <b>is</b> that of an <b>attached</b> item, it is written with regard to idolatry: <b>“Their gods, upon the high mountains”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2), from which it is derived: <b>But the mountains are not their gods, </b> as items attached to the ground are never rendered forbidden as objects of idol worship. The halakhic status of a house built from stones that were detached is that of a detached item. |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | served | Kiddushin 37a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Once the verse includes</b> areas outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> also <b>excludes</b> areas outside of Eretz Yisrael, how is it determined which mitzvot apply outside the land and which do not? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Go and learn from what is stated with regard to</b> a different <b>issue</b> that appears in the next verse: <b>“You shall destroy all the places where</b> the nations that you are to dispossess <b>served</b> their gods” (Deuteronomy 12:2). <b>Just as</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship is distinct</b> in <b>that it is an obligation of the body, and it applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so too, any</b> mitzva <b>that is an obligation of the body applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Conversely, mitzvot that are an obligation connected to the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | and under every leafy tree” | Niddah 13a:19 | <b>Rav Asi says: </b> It is considered <b>as though he worships idols, </b> as <b>it is written here: “Under every leafy tree, ” and it is written there, </b> with regard to the mitzva of eradicating idols from Eretz Yisrael: “You shall destroy all the places, where the nations that you are to dispossess worshipped their gods, <b>upon the high mountains, </b> and upon the hills, <b>and under every leafy tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2). |
| Deuteronomy 12:2 | idol worship. | Sanhedrin 47b:18 | <b>And Rava derives</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> written in the context of a grave <b>from</b> the word <b>“there”</b> written in the context of objects of <b>idol worship. </b> The verse states concerning objects of idol worship: “The places in which the nations…served their gods there” (Deuteronomy 12:2). <b>Just as</b> it <b>does not become prohibited</b> to derive benefit from objects of <b>idol worship through</b> mere <b>designation, </b> but only through actual ritual worship, <b>so too, here</b> it <b>does not become prohibited</b> to derive benefit from items relating to a deceased person <b>through</b> mere <b>designation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | and you shall destroy their name out of that place” | Avodah Zarah45b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where does R' Yosei ben Yehuda, </b> derive the obligation <b>to root out all traces of</b> idol worship? The Talmud answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: “And you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; <b>and you shall destroy their name out of that place”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3). |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | and burn their asherim with fire” | Avodah Zarah45b:4 | Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: </b> “And you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3). Even a tree that was worshipped only after it was planted is forbidden. |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | and burn their asherim with fire” | Avodah Zarah48a:8 | The Talmud explains what the nature of this dispute would be: <b>As R' Yosei bar Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>its trunk is also forbidden, as it is written: </b> “And you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3). Burning with fire destroys the whole tree, which indicates that the entire tree is forbidden, including its trunk. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>the trunk of the tree</b> is <b>permitted, as it is written: </b> “You shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, <b>and hew down their <i>asherim</i>, </b> and burn their graven images with fire” (Deuteronomy 7:5). <b>Which is the tree whose hewn part</b> is <b>forbidden, but its trunk</b> is <b>permitted? You must say</b> it is <b>a tree that one planted and subsequently worshipped. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | and you shall burn their asherim with fire” | Avodah Zarah53b:7 | The Talmud explains: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that he rendered it prohibited? R' Elazar says: </b> This <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applied at the <b>outset of</b> the Jewish people’s conquest of <b>Eretz Yisrael, </b> when the Torah commanded them to destroy any trees that were used as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asherim</i>], <b>as God states: </b> “And you shall break down their altars…<b>and you shall burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3). <b>Now, </b> Eretz Yisrael <b>is</b> the <b>inheritance of</b> the Jewish people <b>from their ancestors, and a person does not render forbidden an item that is not his. </b> If so, how could the non-Jews render the trees forbidden, as the land was not theirs? |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | “And you shall smash | Sanhedrin 90a:3 | <b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the phrase in the verse “to divert you from the way on which YHWH your God commanded you to walk. ” <b>“To walk”; this</b> is a reference to <b>a positive mitzva. “On which”; this</b> is a reference to <b>a prohibition. And if it enters your mind</b> that the verse is stated <b>with regard to idol worship, how can you find a positive mitzva</b> relating to <b>idol worship? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> that the positive mitzva referred to in the verse is: <b>“And you shall smash</b> their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their <i>asherim</i> in fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name from that place” (Deuteronomy 12:3). A prophet is liable to receive the death penalty if he abolishes this mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 12:3 | and you shall destroy their name | Temurah 28b:7 | <b>Rav Ḥananya objects to this: </b> According to this explanation, <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> that the coating of an animal that was worshipped is prohibited is <b>that the verse excluded</b> it, from which it may be inferred <b>that</b> if <b>the verse had not excluded it, </b> then the <b>coating</b> would be <b>permitted. But isn’t it written</b> that idolatry must be entirely eradicated: “And you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; <b>and you shall destroy their name</b> out of that place” (Deuteronomy 12:3). This teaches that not only must the idols themselves be destroyed, but also <b>everything made in their name, </b> including their coating, must be destroyed. |
| Deuteronomy 12:4 | as it is written: “You shall not do so to the Lord your God” | Sanhedrin 113a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>Sacred scrolls must be interred. </b> The Talmud comments: The <i>halakha</i> cited in <b>the Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: Any city in which there is even one <i>mezuza</i> is not rendered an idolatrous city, as it is stated: “And you shall burn it with fire, both the city and all its spoils, entirely</b> for YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 13:17). <b>And</b> in a city <b>where there is a <i>mezuza</i> it is not possible</b> to burn all its spoils, <b>as it is written: “You shall not do so to YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:4), from which it is derived that it is prohibited to destroy any item upon which the name of God appears. |
| Deuteronomy 12:5 | as it is written: “And there you shall come” | Chagigah 4b:2 | It is <b>taught: The uncircumcised and the ritually impure are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance. </b> The Talmud comments: <b>Granted, a ritually impure</b> person is exempt, <b>as it is written: “And there you shall come”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5), followed by: <b>“And there you shall bring”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches: <b>Anyone included in</b> the mitzva of <b>coming, </b> i.e., anyone who may enter the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the obligation of <b>bringing</b> offerings; <b>and anyone not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>coming is not</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation of <b>bringing</b> either. Since it is prohibited for a person who is ritually impure to enter the Temple, he is also exempt from the obligation to bring a burnt-offering of appearance. |
| Deuteronomy 12:5 | be eaten in Nov and Givon. | Pesachim 38b:10 | <b>Reish Lakish said: That is to say, the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers</b> may <b>be eaten in Nov and Givon. </b> In other words, the omission of this reason indicates that offerings could have been sacrificed on the communal altars during the period when improvised altars were permitted, before the Temple was built. These offerings are not among those that can be sacrificed only: “In the place that YHWH shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:5). This means that during that period the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers could indeed have been eaten anywhere, as improvised altars were built in any place. Consequently, even after the Temple was built, the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers are still considered fit to be eaten anywhere in Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 12:5 | to His abode shall you seek, and there you shall come” | Sanhedrin 11b:8 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): The court <b>may intercalate the years only</b> when located <b>in Judea. And if they intercalated it</b> when located <b>in the Galilee, </b> the year is nevertheless <b>intercalated. Ḥananya of Ono testified: </b> Even <b>if</b> the court already formally <b>intercalated</b> the year when located <b>in the Galilee, it is not intercalated. R' Yehuda ben Shimon ben Pazi, says: What is the reasoning of Ḥananya of Ono? The verse states: </b> “But to the place that YHWH your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, <b>to His abode shall you seek, and there you shall come”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5). This is interpreted as: <b>Every pursuit that you shall pursue</b> in the area of <i>halakha</i> <b>must be only in the abode of God, </b> in close proximity to Jerusalem, i.e., in Judea. |
| Deuteronomy 12:5 | to put His name there” | Sotah 38a:10 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even in the outlying areas, </b> outside the Temple, <b>this</b> ineffable name is used. <b>It is stated here, </b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction: <b>“So shall they put My name, ” and it is stated there, </b> with regard to the place one must sacrifice offerings: “The place that YHWH your God has chosen out of all your tribes <b>to put His name there”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5). The verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there, </b> the expression “to put His name there” is referring to <b>the Temple, so too here, </b> the mitzva of “so shall they put My name” applies <b>in the Temple</b> and not anywhere else. |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | the verse states: “And you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your offerings, and your tithes, | Bekhorot 53a:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the mitzva of animal tithe is in effect both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us say that the Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Akiva says: </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person</b> must <b>bring up</b> his <b>animal tithe from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and sacrifice it</b> in the Temple. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your offerings, and your tithes, </b> and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:6). |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” | Bekhorot 56b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>But this</b> verse is not referring to animal tithe; rather, it is <b>written with regard to firstborn</b> animals. The Talmud answers: <b>If it is not</b> needed <b>for the matter of firstborn</b> animals, <b>as</b> the mitzva of sanctifying a firstborn animal <b>does</b> apply <b>in</b> a case of <b>partnership, as it is written, </b> in the plural form: “And you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your offerings, and your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, <b>and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6), <b>apply</b> the verse <b>to the matter of animal tithe, </b> teaching that it does not apply to an animal owned by partners. |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | “And there you shall bring” | Chagigah 4b:2 | It is <b>taught: The uncircumcised and the ritually impure are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance. </b> The Talmud comments: <b>Granted, a ritually impure</b> person is exempt, <b>as it is written: “And there you shall come”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5), followed by: <b>“And there you shall bring”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches: <b>Anyone included in</b> the mitzva of <b>coming, </b> i.e., anyone who may enter the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the obligation of <b>bringing</b> offerings; <b>and anyone not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>coming is not</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation of <b>bringing</b> either. Since it is prohibited for a person who is ritually impure to enter the Temple, he is also exempt from the obligation to bring a burnt-offering of appearance. |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | and the firstborn of your herd [ bekarkhem ] and of your flock [ tzonekhem ]” | Chullin 135b:14 | Therefore, <b>God writes: </b> “And there you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, and your tithes, and the gift of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, <b>and the firstborn of your herd [<i>bekarkhem</i>] and of your flock [<i>tzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6). The pronouns in the terms “your herd” and “your flock” in this verse are in the plural, which indicates that firstborn animals owned in partnership are sanctified. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“your herd” and “your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), where the pronouns are in the singular? The Talmud again answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> animals owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a non-Jew, </b> which are not sanctified. |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | your herd and of your flock [ bekarkhem vetzonekhem ]” | Chullin 136a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>R' Ilai? As it is written: </b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarekha vetzonekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), using the singular pronoun, indicating that only privately owned animals are consecrated. The Talmud comments: <b>But it is</b> also <b>written: </b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarkhem vetzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6), using the plural pronoun. The Talmud explains: This verse is referring to the obligation <b>of all Jews</b> to bring their firstborn animals to the Temple, but this applies only to animals with a single owner. |
| Deuteronomy 12:6 | the verse states: “And there you shall bring your burnt offerings, | Zevachim 60b:4 | R' Yishmael concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And there you shall bring your burnt offerings, </b> and your sacrifices, and your tithes…and the firstborns of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:6); the Torah <b>juxtaposes</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce <b>with</b> the <b>firstborn. Just as</b> the <b>firstborn</b> offering may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple, so too, </b> second<b>-tithe</b> produce may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:7 | “there.” | Zevachim 119a:5 | <b>Reish Lakish said to R' Yoḥanan: Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the Mishnah <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>second tithe as well. </b> R' Yoḥanan <b>said to him: </b> Second <b>tithe is derived from</b> what was written with regard to <b>the Ark, </b> by means of the verbal analogy between <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there. ”</b> With regard to second tithe, the verse states: “And there you shall eat before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:7), while with regard to the Ark, the verse states: “There you shall place the Ark of the Testimony” (Exodus 40:3). Due to the analogy between second tithe and the Ark, one can infer that <b>since there was no Ark</b> in Nov and Gibeon, as at that time it was in Kiriath Jearim, <b>there was also no</b> second <b>tithe</b> eaten there. |
| Deuteronomy 12:8 | man whatsoever is fitting in his own eyes” | Zevachim 117b:10 | The Talmud clarifies the two opinions: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that only the public could sacrifice compulsory offerings on a great public altar? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the period in which private altars were permitted: “You shall not do all that we do here this day, every <b>man whatsoever is fitting in his own eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:8). This indicates that it is <b>“a man, ”</b> i.e., an individual, <b>who may sacrifice only</b> offerings that he deems <b>“fitting, ”</b> i.e., voluntary offerings, but <b>may not sacrifice compulsory</b> offerings. <b>But</b> the <b>public may sacrifice even compulsory</b> offerings. |
| Deuteronomy 12:9 | as it is written: “For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance” | Megillah 10a:3 | The Talmud cites the source of this <i>halakha</i>. It is <b>as it is written: “For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:9), which is interpreted: “<b>Rest, ” this is Shiloh; “inheritance, ” this is Jerusalem. </b> The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> and likens <b>inheritance to rest: Just as</b> in the place of <b>rest, </b> Shiloh, <b>after</b> its destruction <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars, <b>so too</b> in the place of <b>inheritance, </b> Jerusalem, <b>after</b> its destruction <b>there is permission</b> to sacrifice offerings on improvised altars. |
| Deuteronomy 12:9 | “rest” | Zevachim 112b:10 | When <b>they arrived at Shiloh, </b> private <b>altars were prohibited. And there was no roof</b> of wood or stone <b>there, </b> i.e., in the Tabernacle in Shiloh; <b>rather</b> there was <b>only a building of stone below and the curtains</b> of the roof of the Tabernacle were spread <b>above it. And</b> the period that the Tabernacle was in Shiloh <b>was</b> characterized in the Torah as <b>“rest”</b> in the verse: “For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which YHWH your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 12:9). <b>Offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains</b> in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting, <b>and offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe</b> were eaten <b>in any</b> place <b>that overlooks</b> Shiloh. |
| Deuteronomy 12:9 | “rest” | Zevachim 118a:14 | One verse describes the Tabernacle in Shiloh as a house, while the other describes it as a tent. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? As the Mishnah states: <b>There was no roof</b> of wood or stone <b>there; rather, </b> there was <b>stone below, </b> and it was therefore described as a house, <b>and</b> the <b>curtains</b> of the Tabernacle were spread <b>above it, </b> and it was therefore described as a tent. <b>And</b> the period that the Tabernacle was in Shiloh <b>was</b> characterized in the Torah as <b>“rest”</b> in the verse: “For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which YHWH your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 12:9). |
| Deuteronomy 12:9 | “for you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance” | Zevachim 119a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches that when Shiloh was destroyed and they <b>arrived at Nov and Gibeon, </b> private altars were permitted and offerings of lesser sanctity could be eaten in any city in Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? they are derived <b>as A baraita states: </b> The Jewish people were told that when they enter Eretz Yisrael they would be permitted to sacrifice on private altars, <b>“for you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:9), during which time those altars would be prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 12:9 | “For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance” | Zevachim 119a:9 | § The Mishnah teaches that when they <b>arrived at Jerusalem, </b> private altars were prohibited and there was no subsequent period in which they were permitted. And the Temple in Jerusalem was characterized as “inheritance. ” With regard to this, <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse that discusses the permissibility of private altars states: <b>“For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:9). The Talmud interprets: With regard to <b>“rest, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>Shiloh, </b> and with regard to <b>“inheritance, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:11 | “Your choice vows” | Keritot 27a:22 | § <b>R' Elazar raises a dilemma: </b> If the price of <b>lambs depreciated in the world</b> and one cannot find a ram valued at two <i>sela</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we require</b> an offering that fulfills the condition: <b>“Your choice vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:11), <b>and that</b> requirement <b>is</b> fulfilled, as he is bringing the best animal available? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> a guilt offering to be purchased in accordance with the verse: <b>“Silver by shekels”</b> (Leviticus 5:15), i.e., two <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> that requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled. |
| Deuteronomy 12:11 | say: You may not eat them within your gates, | Keritot 5a:2 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But still, it is a general prohibition, </b> as all three types of second tithe are included in a single command. The Talmud explains: <b>If so, </b> that one receives only one set of lashes, <b>let</b> the verse <b>say: You may not eat them within your gates, </b> as a previous verse already stated “your tithes” (Deuteronomy 12:11). <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to specify: <b>“The tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil”? </b> This serves <b>to designate</b> a prohibition and the punishment of lashes for the <b>consumption of each and every</b> type of produce. |
| Deuteronomy 12:11 | all the choicest of your | Yoma 34b:3 | <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>One? </b> It means the <b>special</b> lamb <b>that is</b> one <b>in his flock. </b> The lamb for the daily offering should be of the highest quality. <br><b>And</b> from where does <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive that principle? The Talmud answers that in his opinion, the principle <b>is derived</b> from that which is written: “And <b>all the choicest of your</b> vow-offerings” (Deuteronomy 12:11). One is required to fulfill his vow by offering the animal of the highest quality. <br><b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret this verse? They interpret that <b>one</b> verse refers to the requirement to bring the animal of the highest quality for <b>obligatory</b> offerings and <b>one</b> verse refers to the requirement to bring the animal of the highest quality for gift-offerings. <b>And</b> both verses are <b>necessary, </b> as otherwise it would not have been clear that this requirement applies to both. On the one hand, one might think it is only with regard to obligatory offerings that the animal of the highest quality must be sacrificed. On the other hand, one might think it is only with regard to a gift-offering that the animal of the highest quality must be sacrificed, as if it is not of the highest quality, it is better not to sacrifice it at all. |
| Deuteronomy 12:11 | “Your choice vows” | Yoma 70b:11 | <b>And</b> from where does <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive the requirement that the ram be of the best stock? <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“Your choice vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:11), which teaches that all offerings must be from the choicest animals. <b>And</b> according to <b>R' Elazar ben Shimon, </b> why is this additional verse necessary? <b>One</b> verse refers to <b>obligatory</b> offerings, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> refers to <b>free-will</b> offerings. <b>And</b> both <b>are necessary</b> because the requirement in one case cannot be learned from the other. It is reasonable that a free-will offering must be from the choicest animal since it is a voluntary gift; and it is also reasonable that an obligatory offering should be the choicest, since an obligation must be fulfilled in the finest possible way. |
| Deuteronomy 12:13 | lest you offer up your burnt-offerings | Avodah Zarah51b:2 | This is apparent <b>as</b> the <b>punishment</b> for sacrificing <b>them is stated</b> in this verse, <b>as it is stated: “And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it, </b> to sacrifice an offering to YHWH, before the Tabernacle of YHWH…that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus:17:4). <b>We have heard</b> from that verse the <b>punishment, </b> but with regard to the <b>prohibition</b> against sacrificing on a private altar, <b>from where</b> is it derived? <b>The verse states: </b> “Take heed to yourself <b>lest you offer up your burnt-offerings</b> in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13). |
| Deuteronomy 12:13 | prohibited | Keritot 3b:12 | Since there is a verbal analogy linking slaughtering an offering outside the Temple to sacrificing one outside the Temple, it follows that <b>just as there, </b> with regard to sacrificing, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, as it is written: “Take heed to yourself, lest you sacrifice your burnt offerings in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13), <b>so too here, </b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act as a separate prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 12:13 | as it is written: “Take heed to yourself lest you offer up your burnt offerings | Zevachim 106a:13 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that if one both slaughters and offers up an offering outside the Temple courtyard, he is liable for each act, as they are independent prohibitions. The Talmud asks: <b>Granted</b> that one is liable for the <b>offering up, </b> as the <b>punishment</b> for this act <b>is written</b> in the Torah <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition</b> concerning this act <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> in the Torah. The <b>punishment</b> is <b>as it is written: </b> “Any man…that offers up a burnt offering or sacrifice, <b>and will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, </b> to sacrifice it to YHWH, and that man shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 17:8–9). The <b>prohibition</b> is <b>as it is written: “Take heed to yourself lest you offer up your burnt offerings</b> in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13). <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with that which R' Avin says</b> that <b>R' Elazar says: Wherever it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>Observe, </b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition. </b> Accordingly, the verse in Deuteronomy is understood as issuing a prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 12:13 | as it is written: “Take heed to yourself lest you offer up your burnt offerings | Zevachim 106b:1 | This is apparent, <b>as the punishment for</b> sacrificing <b>them is stated</b> in this verse: <b>“And</b> he did not bring it <b>to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, </b> to sacrifice an offering to YHWH, before the Tabernacle of YHWH…that man shall be cut off from among his people. ” The <b>prohibition</b> is also explicit, <b>as it is written: “Take heed to yourself lest you offer up your burnt offerings</b> in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13). |
| Deuteronomy 12:13 | the verse states: “Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see” | Zevachim 118a:15 | § The Mishnah teaches that during the period of Shiloh, <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> were eaten within the curtains, and offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe were eaten in any place that overlooks Shiloh. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Oshaya said: As</b> in the context of the prohibition against sacrificing outside the Tabernacle, <b>the verse states: “Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:13), from which it may be inferred: <b>You may not offer up in every place that you see, but you may eat</b> the offerings <b>in every place that you see. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:14 | and there you shall do | Keritot 3b:13 | If one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a juxtaposition, </b> it is also as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. The juxtaposition is that <b>the verse states: “There you shall sacrifice</b> your burnt offerings <b>and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). Here the verse <b>juxtaposes slaughtering, </b> in the phrase: “And there you shall do,” <b>to offering up. </b> This teaches that <b>just as there, </b> with regard to offering up, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act. Whether one derives the prohibition by verbal analogy or juxtaposition, it is considered as though the Torah explicitly wrote a prohibition with regard to slaughtering, and therefore this would not meet the criteria of R' Yirmeya’s dilemma. |
| Deuteronomy 12:14 | there you shall offer your burnt-offerings, and there you shall do | Sanhedrin 34b:7 | The Talmud responds: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye says: Even according to the statement of R' Akiva, he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> transgression, <b>as the verse states: </b> “But in the place that YHWH shall choose in one of your tribes, <b>there you shall offer your burnt-offerings, and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). <b>God combined all the actions</b> with regard to offerings as one transgression. According to the explanation of Abaye, there is in fact no practical dispute between R' Yishmael and R' Akiva with regard to this matter, and it serves as an example of one explanation from two different verses. |
| Deuteronomy 12:14 | derived | Zevachim 107a:1 | <b>Rava said: </b> The prohibition can be derived <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of R' Yona, as R' Yona says: </b> It is <b>derived</b> from the verse: “But in the place that YHWH will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer up your burnt offerings and there you shall do all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14), through the juxtaposition of the word <b>“there”</b> in the first part of the verse to the word <b>“there”</b> in the second part of the verse. This serves to juxtapose the offering up, mentioned in the first part, to the sacrifice of an offering, mentioned in the second part, which includes slaughtering it. Accordingly, it teaches that <b>just as there, </b> with regard to offering up, the Torah <b>did not prescribe punishment unless</b> it also <b>prohibited</b> it, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not prescribe punishment unless</b> it also <b>prohibited</b> it. Therefore, even though the Torah does not explicitly state the prohibition, it is evident that it is prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 12:14 | there you shall do | Zevachim 107b:6 | <b>Abaye said: Even according to the statement of R' Akiva, </b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to performing sacrificial rites outside the Temple courtyard: “But in the place that YHWH will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer up your burnt offerings, and <b>there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). Since the first part of the verse makes reference to offering up, by inference, the term “you shall do” in the second part must be referring to all the other sacrificial rites. Therefore, <b>the verse has regarded all of</b> the sacrificial rites apart from offering up as <b>one rite</b> with regard to the prohibition against performing them outside the Temple courtyard. |
| Deuteronomy 12:14 | and there you shall do | Zevachim 118a:17 | <b>R' Yannai said</b> that <b>the</b> subsequent <b>verse states: </b> “But in the place that YHWH shall choose in one of your tribes, <b>there you shall offer</b> your burnt offerings, <b>and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). This verse teaches that all of the sacrificial service is performed in the place that the offering is burned, and only the consumption of offerings of lesser sanctity is permitted in any place that overlooks Shiloh. |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | “Like the gazelle and like the hart” | Bekhorot 12a:24 | <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, says: Is that which is written with regard to</b> disqualified consecrated animals <b>insignificant? </b> The Torah states that their status is: <b>“Like the gazelle and like the hart”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15), indicating that <b>just as one may not redeem</b> a firstborn donkey with <b>a gazelle or a hart, so too, one may not redeem</b> a firstborn donkey with <b>disqualified consecrated</b> animals. |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | the hart” | Bekhorot 12b:1 | <b>according to R' Shimon as well, </b> perhaps one cannot redeem a firstborn donkey with disqualified consecrated animals, as <b>it is written with regard to them</b> that they are to be treated: “Like <b>the gazelle and</b> like <b>the hart”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15). Since a gazelle and a hart cannot be used for redemption, so too, disqualified consecrated animals cannot be used for redemption. |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | as the Sages taught | Bekhorot 15a:20 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And</b> animals whose consecration preceded their blemish <b>do not</b> completely <b>emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume <b>non-sacred</b> status in order to be shorn and to be utilized for labor. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse discussing consecrated animals that developed a blemish and were redeemed: “Notwithstanding, after all the desire of your soul, you may slaughter and eat flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:15). The term <b>“you may slaughter”</b> teaches that slaughtering the animal is permitted, <b>but not shearing</b> it. Likewise, “you may eat <b>flesh”</b> teaches that its meat is permitted, <b>but not</b> its <b>milk. </b> Finally, <b>“you may eat”</b> teaches that you may eat the meat, <b>but</b> you may <b>not</b> feed it <b>to your dogs. From here</b> it is derived <b>that one may not redeem sacrificial</b> animals in order <b>to feed them to dogs. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | your gates” | Bekhorot 15b:8 | <b>Ravina raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: </b> According to R' Ḥanina, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the following matter: <b>Can one dedicate</b> the unborn offspring <b>as any offering he desires? </b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: He may not dedicate them</b> as any offering other than that for which the mother was consecrated. Ravina asked: <b>What is the reason? </b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“Within</b> all <b>your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15), and: <b>“Within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22), written <b>with regard to a firstborn. Just as one cannot dedicate a firstborn as any offering he desires, as it is written: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstborn to YHWH, no man shall sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 27:26), <b>so too, one cannot dedicate these</b> offspring <b>as any offering he desires. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | “Notwithstanding, after all the desire of your soul, you may slaughter and eat flesh, | Bekhorot 32a:3 | It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> in a verse discussing consecrated animals that became blemished: <b>“Notwithstanding, after all the desire of your soul, you may slaughter and eat flesh, </b> according to the blessing of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:15). Now <b>which is the item that has no blessing when</b> it is <b>alive, </b> i.e., it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>but</b> it does have a blessing <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter, </b> as indicated by the verse “You may slaughter…according to the blessing of YHWH your God”? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> the meat of the <b>animal tithe</b> offering. |
| Deuteronomy 12:15 | As the Sages taught | Temurah 31a:10 | § The Mishnah further teaches: With regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that became <i>tereifa</i>, one may not redeem</b> them and render them non-sacred, as their consumption is prohibited, and one does not redeem sacrificial animals to feed them to dogs. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: “Notwithstanding you may slaughter and eat flesh within all your gates” (Deuteronomy 12:15). This verse, which is referring to disqualified consecrated animals that have been redeemed, is expounded as follows: <b>“You may slaughter, ” but</b> you may <b>not shear</b> their wool; <b>“and eat, ” but</b> you may <b>not</b> give <b>to your dogs</b> to eat; “and eat <b>flesh, ” but not</b> their <b>milk. From here</b> it is derived <b>that one does not redeem sacrificial</b> animals <b>to feed them to dogs. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:16 | you shall pour it upon the earth as water” | Chullin 35b:15 | With regard to <b>blood of slaughter it is also written: </b> “Only, you shall not eat the blood; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth as water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The parallel to water ostensibly indicates that the blood of slaughter should also render food items susceptible to ritual impurity. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse is not written with regard to susceptibility to impurity. The purpose for <b>which</b> it <b>comes</b> is <b>to permit benefit</b> from the <b>blood of disqualified consecrated</b> animals. |
| Deuteronomy 12:16 | you shall pour it upon the earth like water” | Pesachim 16a:17 | The Talmud rejects this contention: <b>Explain this</b> statement as referring <b>to blood. </b> R' Yosei ben Ḥanina was not referring to all liquids in the Temple, but only to blood. <b>As R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of consecrated</b> offerings <b>that it does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? <b>As it is stated: </b> “You shall surely not eat the blood; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The rabbis derived from this verse: <b>Blood that is poured like water, </b> i.e., blood from a non-sacred domesticated animal that pours out when it is slaughtered and is not received in a vessel as sacrificial blood assumes the legal status of water and <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 12:16 | As it is stated: “You shall surely not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the earth like water” | Pesachim 20a:3 | <b>If we say that it was rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>by</b> the <b>blood</b> that flowed when it was slaughtered, <b>didn’t R' Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of consecrated</b> offerings <b>that it does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? <b>As it is stated: “You shall surely not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The rabbis derived from this verse: <b>Blood that is poured like water, </b> i.e., blood from a non-sacred domesticated animal that is poured out when it is slaughtered and not received in a vessel like sacrificial blood, assumes the legal status of water and <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>Blood that is not poured out like water, </b> but is received in a vessel to be sprinkled on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | “You may not eat within your gates | Bava Metzia56a:8 | Abaye continued: <b>And Rav Sheshet does not legitimately raise an objection, as</b> R' Elazar and Shmuel <b>are speaking</b> about cases punishable by <b>death, and Rav Sheshet raised</b> his <b>objection</b> from a case involving a mere <b>prohibition, as it is written</b> with regard to second tithe: <b>“You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>And to</b> that <b>which Rav Sheshet raised</b> as <b>an objection, Rav Yosef legitimately respond to his</b> difficulty. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | is compared to first fruits, as | Chullin 120b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> itself? </b> the Talmud answers: It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>is compared to first fruits, as</b> it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your cattle and of your flocks, or any of your vows that you will vow, or your pledges, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17), and <b>the Master said</b> with regard to the phrase <b>“nor the offering [<i>teruma</i>] of your hand”</b> that <b>these are</b> the <b>first fruits. </b> Since the verse uses the term “<i>teruma</i>” with regard to first fruits, the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> is compared to the <i>halakha</i> of first fruits: Just as liquid that emerges from first fruits is forbidden like the fruit itself, so too liquid that emerges from <i>teruma</i> is forbidden like the produce itself. Consequently, the prohibition against consuming the liquid that emerges from consecrated produce can be derived from <i>teruma</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | your herd and of your flock [ bekarekha vetzonekha ]” | Chullin 136a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>R' Ilai? As it is written: </b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarekha vetzonekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), using the singular pronoun, indicating that only privately owned animals are consecrated. The Talmud comments: <b>But it is</b> also <b>written: </b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarkhem vetzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6), using the plural pronoun. The Talmud explains: This verse is referring to the obligation <b>of all Jews</b> to bring their firstborn animals to the Temple, but this applies only to animals with a single owner. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | even though it is written: “The tithe of your grain [ deganekha ]” | Chullin 136a:2 | Similarly, with regard to <b>tithe, </b> R' Ilai concedes that joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written: “The tithe of your grain [<i>deganekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), using the singular pronoun, from which one might have inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> grain, <b>yes, </b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership, </b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. The reason is that <b>God writes: </b> “All <b>your tithes [<i>ma’asroteikhem</i>]”</b> (Numbers 18:28), using the plural pronoun, indicating that even partners are obligated in this mitzva. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term: <b>“The tithe of your grain [<i>deganekha</i>], ”</b> using the singular pronoun, <b>come? </b> The Talmud answers: It serves <b>to exclude</b> produce owned in <b>partnership with a non-Jew</b> from the obligation of tithes. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | your grain” | Gittin 47a:9 | <b>And R' Elazar says: Even though a non-Jew has</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to tithes: “The tithe of <b>your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), which teaches that it is only the grain of a Jew that is obligated in tithes <b>and not the grain of a non-Jew; a non-Jew does not have, however, </b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves, </b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The earth is YHWH’s”</b> (Psalms 24:1). |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | the Merciful One to write: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil” | Keritot 4b:30 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>Since God writes: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), from which it is derived that <b>inside</b> the chosen place, Jerusalem, <b>yes, </b> one may eat second tithe, but <b>outside</b> Jerusalem, <b>no, </b> one may not eat second tithe; <b>why do I</b> need <b>God to write: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17)? This verse serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions concerning tithes, to teach that one is separately liable to receive lashes for consuming each type of produce. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | the Merciful One writes: “You may not eat” | Keritot 5a:1 | reason that <b>God writes: “You may not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>to establish</b> the consumption of second-tithe produce outside Jerusalem <b>as a prohibition. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | the verse states: “You may not eat within your gates | Makkot 16b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: It is derived as <b>the verse states: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and there it states: </b> “And you shall give to the Levite, to the convert, to the orphan, and to the widow, <b>and they shall eat within your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to the phrase “and they shall eat within your gates,” it is referring to <b>poor man’s tithe, here too, </b> “you may not eat within your gates” is referring to produce in which there is <b>poor man’s tithe, </b> as it has not yet been separated, <b>and God states</b> a prohibition: <b>You may not</b> eat it. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | as it is taught | Makkot 17a:11 | <b>What</b> is the statement of <b>R' Shimon? </b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to food items that may not be eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem. It is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows that you vow, nor your gift offerings, nor the donation of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). The rabbis explain that with regard to the phrase <b>“nor the donation of [<i>terumat</i>] your hand, ” these are first fruits. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | Rather, | Makkot 18a:1 | <b>Rather, </b> the derivation is that the entire verse beginning: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17) <b>is a superfluous verse. After all, it is</b> already <b>written: “And there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the donation of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock, <b>and there you shall eat before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6–7); all the items that must be eaten within the walls of Jerusalem are enumerated. <b>Let God write</b> simply: <b>You may not eat them, </b> in general terms, which would constitute a prohibition for which one would be liable to receive lashes for each of the cases enumerated. <b>Why do I</b> need <b>God</b> to <b>again</b> specifically <b>enumerate</b> and <b>detail</b> each of <b>them? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | prohibitions for each and every one | Makkot 18a:2 | <b>Rather, </b> this repetition serves <b>to designate</b> additional <b>prohibitions for each and every one</b> of the cases enumerated in the later verse (Deuteronomy 12:17). The prohibition is derived not by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference; rather, it is derived from the superfluous verse. R' Shimon derives by means of the <i>a fortiori</i> inferences the additional prohibition that is in effect in each of these cases. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | “You may not eat within your gates” | Makkot 19b:15 | § <b>R' Asi says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> With regard to <b>second-tithe</b> produce, <b>from when is one liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>it</b> outside the walls of Jerusalem? It is <b>from when</b> the produce <b>entered within the wall</b> of Jerusalem. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is derived <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to second-tithe produce: <b>“Before YHWH your God you shall eat it”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:18), <b>and it is written</b> in the previous verse: <b>“You may not eat within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we read concerning it: “Before YHWH your God you shall eat it, ” we read concerning it</b> the prohibition: <b>“You may not eat within your gates, ”</b> i.e., it may not be eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem; <b>and anywhere that we do not read concerning it: “Before YHWH your God you shall eat it, ”</b> as the produce remained outside the walls, <b>we do not read concerning it</b> the prohibition: <b>“You may not eat within your gates. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | “You may not eat within your gates | Makkot 19b:6 | The Talmud answers: It is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to second-tithe produce: <b>“You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and later, </b> with regard to a blemished firstborn animal, the verse <b>states: “Within your gates you may eat it, the impure and the pure</b> may eat it alike” (Deuteronomy 15:22). |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | With regard to first fruits, they are also called teruma , as it is taught | Meilah 15b:13 | <b>With regard to first fruits, they are also called <i>teruma</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses foods that may not be eaten outside Jerusalem: The verse states: “You cannot eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil or the firstlings of your herd or of your flock, or any of your vows that you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>“And the offering of your hand”; these are first fruits. But</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> items listed in the Mishnah, i.e., <i>teruma</i>, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>, it <b>is not necessary</b> to explain why they join together or to cite a verse, as it is clear that they are called <i>teruma</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | is stated with regard to first fruits: “ Teruma ” | Menachot 77b:4 | <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and derive the measure from a different verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here: “<i>Teruma</i>, ” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to first fruits: “<i>Teruma</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>Just as below, </b> with regard to first fruits, <b>it has no measure, so too here, </b> say that <b>it has no measure. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | a juxtaposition. As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd | Pesachim 24a:12 | <b>And if you say</b> that there is a general principle that <b>we do not warn, </b> i.e., we may not deduce a prohibition, <b>through logical derivation</b> alone, then one could respond that his issue is not only derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference; rather, <b>it is</b> also derived from an analogy based on <b>a juxtaposition. As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd</b> or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you have vowed, nor your voluntary offerings, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). Since the verse itself juxtaposes tithes to offerings, it indicates that there is a prohibition with regard to offerings just as there is with regard to tithes. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates | Pesachim 36b:9 | The Talmud explains this dispute: <b>What is the reason for the Rabbis’</b> opinion, which maintains that an acute mourner may not eat first fruits? <b>As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free-will offerings, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>And the Master said: “The offering of your hand, ” these are first fruits, as</b> this verse <b>compares first fruits to</b> the second <b>tithe: Just as</b> the second <b>tithe is prohibited to an acute mourner, </b> as stated explicitly in the Torah, <b>so too</b> are <b>first fruits prohibited to an acute mourner. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil…nor the offering of your hand” | Yevamot 73b:2 | § Having cited the Mishnah, the Talmud proceeds to discuss it. It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that second tithe and first fruits <b>are forbidden to an acute mourner; and R' Shimon permits</b> an acute mourner to partake of first fruits. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do</b> the Rabbis derive that first fruits are forbidden to one who is in acute mourning? <b>As it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil…nor the offering of your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and the Master said: “The offering [<i>teruma</i>] of your hand, ” these are</b> the <b>first fruits. And first fruits are juxtaposed</b> in this verse <b>to</b> second <b>tithe: Just as</b> the second <b>tithe is forbidden to an acute mourner, so too, first fruits</b> are <b>forbidden to an acute mourner. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | ritual impurity? The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain” | Yevamot 73b:7 | The Talmud explains: Rather, <b>this is</b> the <b>dilemma he is raising: From where</b> is it derived that one may not eat it when the tithe <b>itself</b> is in a state of <b>ritual impurity? The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and later it states</b> with regard to offerings that have been disqualified: <b>“You shall eat it within your gates, the impure and the pure alike, as the gazelle and as the hart”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22). <b>And</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Yishmael taught: Even a ritually impure and a ritually pure</b> person <b>may eat</b> together <b>on one table</b> and <b>out of one bowl without concern. And God states: That which I said to you there, </b> with regard to disqualified offerings: <b>“You shall eat it within your gates, ”</b> means regardless of whether it is the individual or the meat that is impure; but <b>here, </b> with regard to second tithe, <b>you may not eat</b> it in that state. From here it is derived that one may not eat second tithe when the tithe itself is ritually impure. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates | Yevamot 86a:5 | <b>The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and below, </b> with regard to the poor man’s tithe, <b>it states: “That they may eat within your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). <b>Just as “your gates” stated below</b> is referring to <b>the poor man’s tithe, so too “your gates” stated here</b> is referring to <b>the poor man’s tithe, and God states</b> in the Torah <b>“you may not</b> eat,” implying that it may be eaten only after separation. |
| Deuteronomy 12:17 | And furthermore, it is written: “You may not eat within your gates | Zevachim 55a:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>If so, also</b> with regard to <b>removing it, </b> why not say that <b>we remove it to one</b> place, but <b>we do not remove it from two</b> places? Accordingly, the initial derivation should be to eat it in the Israelites’ camp. <b>And furthermore, it is written: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your gift offerings, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). This verse negates the possibility that an offering may be eaten “in your gates,” i.e., outside of Jerusalem. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the source for the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Abaye. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:18 | “Before the Lord your God you shall eat it” | Makkot 19b:15 | § <b>R' Asi says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> With regard to <b>second-tithe</b> produce, <b>from when is one liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>it</b> outside the walls of Jerusalem? It is <b>from when</b> the produce <b>entered within the wall</b> of Jerusalem. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is derived <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to second-tithe produce: <b>“Before YHWH your God you shall eat it”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:18), <b>and it is written</b> in the previous verse: <b>“You may not eat within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we read concerning it: “Before YHWH your God you shall eat it, ” we read concerning it</b> the prohibition: <b>“You may not eat within your gates, ”</b> i.e., it may not be eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem; <b>and anywhere that we do not read concerning it: “Before YHWH your God you shall eat it, ”</b> as the produce remained outside the walls, <b>we do not read concerning it</b> the prohibition: <b>“You may not eat within your gates. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:20 | “When the Lord your God shall expand your border, as He has promised you, and you shall say: I will eat flesh… | Chullin 16b:14 | With regard to the statement: <b>One may always slaughter, who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said: </b> It <b>is R' Yishmael, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“When YHWH your God shall expand your border, as He has promised you, and you shall say: I will eat flesh…</b>you may eat flesh with all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:20), <b>R' Yishmael says: The verse comes only to permit</b> consumption of the non-sacrificial <b>meat of desire to</b> the Jewish people. |
| Deuteronomy 12:20 | “When the Lord, your God, expands your | Chullin 84a:19 | In a similar vein, <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“When YHWH, your God, expands your</b> boundary…according to every craving of your soul you may eat meat” (Deuteronomy 12:20). <b>The Torah taught</b> that it is <b>a desired mode of behavior that a person should consume meat due only to appetite. </b> That is, one should consume meat only when he feels a need to eat it. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | you shall slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep” | Chullin 102a:11 | It is that the <b>verse states: </b> “Then <b>you shall slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). This verse is closely followed by the verse that serves as the source of the prohibition to eat a limb severed from a living animal (Deuteronomy 12:23), indicating that the prohibition applies only to kosher domesticated animals. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | “If the place that the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there be too far from you, then you shall slaughter of your herd and of your flock” | Chullin 17a:2 | <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: </b> The <i>tanna</i> who teaches this <i>halakha</i> <b>is R' Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“If the place that YHWH your God shall choose to put His name there be too far from you, then you shall slaughter of your herd and of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21), <b>R' Akiva says: The verse comes only to prohibit for them</b> consumption of <b>meat</b> of an animal killed by means <b>of stabbing</b> rather than valid slaughter, <b>as, initially, </b> the <b>meat of stabbing was permitted for them. When they entered into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the <b>meat of stabbing was forbidden to them, </b> and it was permitted to eat the meat of an animal only after valid slaughter. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | the verse states: “And you shall slaughter [ vezavaḥta ] | Chullin 27a:8 | <b>Rav Yeimar says: </b> From where is it derived that slaughter is performed from the neck? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And you shall slaughter [<i>vezavaḥta</i>]</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the blood <b>flows [<i>shezav</i>], break it [<i>ḥattehu</i>], </b> i.e., cut it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of breaking? </b> The Talmud answers: It is inferred from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Neither fear nor be dismayed [<i>teḥat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:21); ensure that your spirit will not be broken. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | as I have commanded you” | Chullin 28a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with R' Elazar HaKappar</b> and holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law? <b>It is R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The Torah states: <b>“And you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock, which YHWH has given you, <b>as I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches that Moses was</b> previously <b>commanded</b> about the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, even though they are not written explicitly in the Torah. He was commanded <b>about</b> cutting <b>the gullet and about</b> cutting <b>the windpipe, and about the</b> requirement to cut the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>for a bird, and the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>for an animal. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | is written: “And you shall slaughter” | Chullin 31b:19 | <b>Rava said</b> that it was <b>with this</b> contention that <b>R' Natan overcame the Rabbis: </b> He said: <b>Is it written</b> with regard to the slaughter of non-sacred animals: <b>And you shall cut? </b> It <b>is written: “And you shall slaughter”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). The Torah does not distinguish between cutting and slaughtering; <b>if we require intent for cutting, we</b> should <b>require</b> intent <b>even for slaughtering. </b> Conversely, <b>if we do not require intent for slaughtering, we should also not require</b> intent <b>for cutting. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | as I have commanded you” | Chullin 85b:16 | <b>And if you would say</b> the reason is because R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law, and</b> consequently <b>the tearing loose</b> of <b>its</b> windpipe and gullet <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter</b> such that he would be required to cover the blood, this is untenable. As <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The verse states: “And you shall slaughter…<b>as I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). This <b>teaches that Moses was</b> previously <b>commanded</b> concerning the mitzvot of slaughter, i.e., he was taught <b>about the gullet and the windpipe, </b> that the cutting of these <i>simanim</i> constitutes slaughter, <b>and about</b> the requirement to cut the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>of a bird, and about</b> the requirement to cut <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>of an animal. </b> If so, R' Yehuda HaNasi holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | “As I have commanded you” | Chullin 86a:3 | The Talmud responds: Ravin <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. </b> That is, <b>it is not necessary</b> to teach: <b>Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, since</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is not</b> considered <b>slaughter</b> and one would not be required to cover the blood of the bird. <b>But</b> with regard to the instruction: <b>Go out</b> and <b>tear loose</b> the windpipe and gullet, <b>I would say</b> that the <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law</b> to render it permitted for consumption, <b>and</b> consequently, <b>the tearing loose</b> of <b>its</b> windpipe and gullet <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter and</b> the blood of this bird <b>should require covering. </b> Therefore, Ravin <b>teaches us</b> that R' Yehuda HaNasi holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law, as he himself derives from the verse: <b>“As I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | be too far from you, then you shall slaughter | Kiddushin 57b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: The source for the <i>halakha</i> is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the ritual slaughter of animals for meat consumption: <b>“If the place</b> which YHWH your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), from which it is derived: <b>When</b> you are <b>far from the place, </b> i.e., the Temple, <b>you may slaughter</b> non-sacred animals for meat consumption, <b>but you may not slaughter</b> non-sacred animals <b>in a near place, </b> i.e., in the Temple. The verse serves to <b>exclude non-sacred</b> animals, thereby teaching <b>that they may not be slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | and you shall eat | Kiddushin 57b:17 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>but if he did slaughter it would be permitted for him</b> to eat it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If the place</b> which YHWH your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock, which YHWH has given you, as I have commanded you, <b>and you shall eat</b> within your gates, after all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is expounded as follows: <b>That which you slaughter in a far place, </b> outside the Temple, <b>you may eat, but you may not eat that which you slaughter in a near place, </b> which <b>excludes non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. </b> Therefore, it is prohibited to eat a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard even after the fact. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | be too far from you, then you shall slaughter | Temurah 12a:1 | Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: Slaughtering a pregnant peace offering containing a non-sacred fetus is not subject to the prohibition against slaughtering non-sacred animals in the Temple courtyard. <b>Do we read</b> the verse: <b>“If the place</b> which YHWH your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), as applying <b>to</b> such a case? This verse prohibits the slaughter of non-sacred animals in the Temple, but only those that could be slaughtered elsewhere. But here, he had no choice but to slaughter the pregnant mother in the Temple, since it was a peace offering. |
| Deuteronomy 12:21 | as I have commanded you” | Yoma 75b:4 | <b>And it was taught</b> in a related <i>baraita</i>: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The verse states: <b>“Then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock which YHWH has given you, <b>as I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). <b>This teaches that Moses was commanded in</b> the laws of ritual slaughter to cut the <b>gullet and the windpipe</b> in the neck. <b>And with a bird</b> one must cut through <b>the majority</b> of <b>one</b> pipe, <b>and with an animal</b> one must cut through <b>the majority of</b> both pipes. Moses was commanded these laws along with the other details of slaughtering. According to R' Yehuda HaNasi, the word <i>shatoaḥ</i> does not teach us about ritual slaughter. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: <i>Shatoaḥ</i>? </b> It <b>teaches that</b> the manna <b>fell in layers [<i>mashtiḥin</i>]</b> in a straight row. |
| Deuteronomy 12:22 | gazelle | Bekhorot 15a:5 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>But</b> if <b>their consecration preceded</b> their blemish, they are exempt from the mitzva of the firstborn and from the priestly gifts. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as A baraita states</b> with regard to a verse discussing disqualified consecrated animals: “However, as you eat the <b>gazelle</b> and the hart, so shall you eat thereof” (Deuteronomy 12:22). <b>Just as a gazelle is exempt</b> from the mitzva of the <b>firstborn, </b> as this obligation does not apply to undomesticated animals, <b>so too, disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>are exempt</b> from the mitzva of the <b>firstborn. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:22 | “However, as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so shall you eat of it, | Chullin 17a:9 | <b>Granted, according to R' Akiva, who says</b> that the <b>meat of desire was not forbidden at all, that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> before they entered Eretz Yisrael: <b>“However, as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so shall you eat of it, </b> the pure and the impure may eat of it alike” (Deuteronomy 12:22). This means that just as it is permitted to eat the meat of a gazelle and a deer in the wilderness in a state of ritual impurity, so may you eat them when you enter Eretz Yisrael, although at that point it will be prohibited to stab them and eat their meat, as their meat will be permitted only through slaughter. <b>But according to R' Yishmael, </b> who holds that the meat of desire was forbidden in the wilderness, <b>were the gazelle and the deer themselves permitted</b> in the wilderness? They are not brought as offerings. |
| Deuteronomy 12:22 | is eaten, | Chullin 28a:3 | The Talmud rejects that proof: Although it is clear from that Mishnah that slaughter of birds is obligatory by Torah law, R' Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i></b> who holds that it is not obligatory by Torah law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Elazar HaKappar, the distinguished Sage, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “However, as the gazelle</b> and as the deer <b>is eaten, </b> so shall you eat of it” (Deuteronomy 12:22)? <b>And what now have we derived from the gazelle and the deer</b> with regard to disqualified consecrated animals? |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | you shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Chullin 102a:1 | and <b>you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). <b>R' Yehuda and R' Elazar hold</b> that with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose blood you are commanded</b> not to eat, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs, </b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>these non-kosher</b> species <b>also, since you are commanded</b> not to eat <b>their blood, you are commanded with regard to their limbs. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | “And you shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Chullin 102a:2 | <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the verse indicates: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone, </b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs, </b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs, </b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | as it is stated: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood, | Chullin 102a:5 | <b>This</b> fact that it is R' Elazar who derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse, as opposed to R' Yehuda, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>applies with regard to</b> a limb from <b>a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird, </b> and <b>whether</b> it is from <b>a non-kosher</b> species <b>or a kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood, </b> for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23). |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | “And you shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Chullin 102a:7 | <b>And the Rabbis say: </b> The prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only to kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone, </b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs, </b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs, </b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Chullin 102b:11 | § The Talmud discusses the source of the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>R' Yoḥanan says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>, </b> even if it is not an entire limb. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Chullin 102b:12 | <b>And R' Shimon ben Lakish says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibitions of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and</b> of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living. </b> And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | of blood, | Chullin 72a:8 | The Talmud comments: <b>And R' Yishmael requires</b> that verse <b>to</b> teach about <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that comes from a corpse, </b> meaning <b>that</b> even <b>it imparts impurity</b> like a corpse, <b>as it is stated: “Whoever touches of a corpse, of the life of a person</b> that died” (Numbers 19:13). <b>What is</b> the case of <b>a life of a person that imparts impurity? You must say this</b> is referring to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood, </b> as blood is regarded as the life force of a person, as the verse states: “For the blood is the life” (Deuteronomy 12:23), and a person requires a minimum of a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood to survive. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | states: “Only be steadfast to not eat the blood, as the blood is the soul” | Makkot 23b:2 | <b>R' Shimon bar R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that as the verse <b>states: “Only be steadfast to not eat the blood, as the blood is the soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), it can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>the blood, which a person’s soul loathes, one who abstains from its</b> consumption <b>receives a reward</b> for that action, as it is written in a subsequent verse: “You shall not eat it, so that it shall be good for you and for your children after you” (Deuteronomy 12:25); then concerning <b>robbery and</b> sex with <b>forbidden relatives, which a person’s soul desires and covets, one who abstains from their</b> performance and overcomes his inclination, <b>all the more so that he and his descendants and the descendants of his descendants until the end of all generations will merit</b> a reward. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | As the Merciful One states: “Only be strong not to eat the blood; for the blood is the soul” | Pesachim 16b:3 | The Talmud comments: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ami accepted this</b> statement <b>from</b> R' Zeira and cited a verse that supports it. <b>As God states: “Only be strong not to eat the blood; for the blood is the soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). This verse indicates: <b>Blood</b> with regard to which <b>the soul leaves</b> the body when it is spilled <b>is called blood; </b> however, <b>blood</b> with regard to which <b>the soul</b> does not <b>leave</b> the body when it is spilled, but which is squeezed out afterward, <b>is not called blood. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” | Pesachim 22b:2 | The Talmud further challenges R' Abbahu’s opinion: <b>And</b> yet there is the prohibition against eating <b>a limb</b> cut <b>from a living</b> animal, <b>as it is written: </b> “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; <b>and you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person</b> may <b>not offer a cup of wine to a nazirite, </b> who is prohibited from drinking wine, and that he may not offer <b>a limb</b> cut <b>from a living animal to a descendant of Noah, </b> who is prohibited by Noahide law from eating a limb from a living animal? <b>The verse states: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). Causing another person to sin is like placing a stumbling block before a blind person; one who does so violates this prohibition. The prohibition of giving a limb from a living animal to a non-Jew is apparently due only to the prohibition of placing a stumbling block. <b>However, it is permitted</b> for one to throw it <b>to dogs. </b> Therefore, despite the fact that the verse says: “You shall not eat it,” apparently there is no prohibition against benefiting from this prohibited item. This challenges R' Abbahu’s principle. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | to blood. As it is written: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; | Pesachim 22b:3 | The Talmud answers: <b>A limb from a living animal is different, as it is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to blood. As it is written: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; </b> and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23). Just as it is permitted to benefit from blood, it is likewise permitted to benefit from a limb torn from a living animal. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | “Only be steadfast in not eating blood, as the blood is the life, | Sanhedrin 59a:8 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Similarly, you</b> can <b>say</b> that according to the opinion of R' Ḥanina, blood from a living animal is also forbidden to the Jewish people in particular; as it is stated: <b>“Only be steadfast in not eating blood, as the blood is the life, </b> and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23). With regard to the statements: <b>“Only be steadfast in not eating blood, ” this is a limb from a living</b> animal; <b>“as the blood is the life, ” this is blood from a living</b> animal. |
| Deuteronomy 12:23 | as “soul” is written concerning it, | Sanhedrin 84b:8 | The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “And one who strikes an animal</b> shall pay for it; <b>and one who strikes a person</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), juxtaposing one who strikes an individual with one who strikes an animal. An earlier verse states: “One who strikes the soul of an animal shall pay for it” (Leviticus 24:18). Based on this it is derived: <b>Just as one who strikes an animal</b> is not liable <b>unless he wounds it</b> and draws blood, <b>as “soul” is written concerning it, </b> and it can be derived from the verse: “For the blood is the soul” (Deuteronomy 12:23), that the term “soul” is a reference to blood, <b>so too, one who strikes a person</b> is not liable <b>unless he causes a wound</b> and draws blood. |
| Deuteronomy 12:24 | taught ugly, | Chullin 115b:1 | <b>Is that</b> derivation <b>that R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught ugly, </b> that you derive a new one? The verse states with regard to an animal’s blood: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth as water” (Deuteronomy 12:24), and the next verse adds: <b>“You shall not eat it; </b> that it may go well with you, and with your children after you. ” R' Yehuda HaNasi teaches that the redundant second verse is not referring to the prohibition of blood. Rather, <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, </b> teaching that it is prohibited for consumption. |
| Deuteronomy 12:24 | you shall pour it upon the earth like water” | Chullin 33a:12 | <b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when blood emerges from them, does it render</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>But doesn’t R' Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: </b> “You shall not eat it; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood</b> of a non-sacred animal, <b>which is poured like water</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. By contrast, blood of a sacrificial animal, <b>which is not poured like water</b> but is presented on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 12:24 | as it is stated: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth like water” | Chullin 36b:10 | <b>If we say that it was rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>blood</b> of the animal, this is difficult. <b>But doesn’t R' Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>that it does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood</b> of a non-sacred animal, <b>which is poured like water</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.

| Deuteronomy 12:24 | “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out upon the earth like water” | Pesachim 22a:8 | The Talmud answers: <b>Blood is different, as it is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to water. As it is written</b> with regard to blood: <b>“You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). From here it is derived: <b>Just as it is permitted</b> to benefit from <b>water, so too, it is permitted</b> to benefit from <b>blood. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:24 | As it is stated: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out upon the earth like water” | Pesachim 22b:1 | The Talmud asks: <b>According to Ḥizkiya, </b> who says that: You shall not eat, indicates only that eating is prohibited but that benefit is permitted, <b>for what <i>halakha</i> is blood juxtaposed to water? </b> According to his opinion, there is no need for the verse to teach that one may benefit from blood. The Talmud answers that he needs this verse <b>to derive</b> that which was taught by <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba, as R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood of sacrifices does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>As it is stated: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood that is poured out like water, </b> such as that of a slaughtered, non-sacrificial animal, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. However, sacrificial blood, <b>which is not poured out like water</b> and is instead sprinkled on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 12:25 | receives a reward | Makkot 23b:2 | <b>R' Shimon bar R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that as the verse <b>states: “Only be steadfast to not eat the blood, as the blood is the soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), it can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>the blood, which a person’s soul loathes, one who abstains from its</b> consumption <b>receives a reward</b> for that action, as it is written in a subsequent verse: “You shall not eat it, so that it shall be good for you and for your children after you” (Deuteronomy 12:25); then concerning <b>robbery and</b> sex with <b>forbidden relatives, which a person’s soul desires and covets, one who abstains from their</b> performance and overcomes his inclination, <b>all the more so that he and his descendants and the descendants of his descendants until the end of all generations will merit</b> a reward. |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | “Only your sacred items which you have, and your vows, | Bekhorot 14b:13 | <b>Rava says</b> in response: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the school of R' Yishmael has already ruled</b> that the blemished offspring of sacrificial animals cannot be sacrificed upon the altar, from a different verse. <b>As the school of R' Yishmael taught: </b> The verse states: <b>“Only your sacred items which you have, and your vows, </b> you shall take, and go to the place which YHWH shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:26). <b>“Only your sacred items”; these are the substitutes. “Which you have”; these are the offspring. </b> When it states: <b>“And your vows, ”</b> the verse thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> animal substitutes and offspring <b>with</b> an animal consecrated by <b>a vow, </b> teaching that <b>just as</b> an animal consecrated by <b>a vow</b> is <b>not</b> sacrificed if it is <b>blemished, so too, these are also not</b> sacrificed if they are <b>blemished. </b> Accordingly, Deuteronomy 17:1 must be understood as referring to a private altar of an individual, as maintained by R' Elazar. |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | “Only your sacred things that you have, and your vows” | Nazir 25a:3 | <b>Rava said: You cannot say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> should apply to <b>allocated</b> funds, as <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of R' Yishmael has already ruled</b> in <b>this</b> regard. The <i>tanna</i> explained the following verse that deals with the obligation to bring consecrated animals to the Temple: <b>“Only your sacred things that you have, and your vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26). <b>The verse is speaking of the offspring of consecrated</b> female peace-offerings <b>and their substitutes, </b> i.e., when one says a non-sacred animal should substitute for a sacred animal. |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | remedy? “You shall take and go to the place that the Lord shall choose” | Nazir 25a:4 | With regard to these animals, <b>what is their</b> means of <b>remedy? “You shall take and go to the place that YHWH shall choose”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26). One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that <b>he must bring them up to the Temple, and</b> yet he does not sacrifice them but <b>withholds water and food from them so that they should die. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God; and the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of YHWH your God, and you shall eat the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:27). |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | the verse states: “Only” | Nazir 25a:5 | The <i>tanna</i> explains that this verse comes <b>to say to you: In the manner that you treat a burnt-offering you must treat its substitute, </b> i.e., it should be sacrificed in its entirety; <b>in the manner that you treat a peace-offering you must treat their offspring, </b> as its inner parts must be sacrificed on the altar, with the rest eaten by the owners. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the offspring of a sin-offering and the substitute of a guilt-offering</b> should <b>also</b> be treated <b>so, </b> i.e., they too should be sacrificed on the altar like sin-offerings and guilt-offerings. Therefore <b>the verse states: “Only”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26), which excludes these cases. This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | the verse states: “Only” | Nazir 25b:2 | § The Talmud continues to discuss the <i>baraita</i>. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the offspring of a sin-offering and the substitute of a guilt-offering</b> should <b>also</b> be treated <b>so, </b> i.e., they too should be sacrificed on the altar like sin-offerings and guilt-offerings. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26). The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? After all, <b>this <i>halakha</i> is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>the offspring of a sin-offering goes to</b> its <b>death. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>So too, </b> this is correct as far as the offspring of a sin-offering is concerned, <b>and the verse comes</b> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to a guilt-offering</b> as well. |
| Deuteronomy 12:26 | he transgresses a positive mitzva by it, | Nazir 25b:4 | <b>Rather, </b> the argument is as follows: <b>If</b> one would have learned this ruling only <b>from the</b> aforementioned <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>I would say: </b> It is admittedly <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> that the offspring of a sin-offering must die and the substitute of a guilt-offering is left to graze, <b>but if he sacrificed it</b> regardless, <b>he would not be liable to</b> receive <b>any</b> punishment <b>for it. The verse</b> therefore <b>teaches us that if he sacrifices</b> the offspring or substitute of a guilt-offering, <b>he transgresses a positive mitzva by it, </b> as derived from the verse: “Only your sacred things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which YHWH shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:26). |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, | Chullin 90a:12 | One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>they became detached</b> from the flesh of the burnt offering they are burned upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27), indicating that only the flesh and the blood are offered upon the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, | Chullin 90a:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27), which indicates that only the flesh and blood of an offering are offered on the altar? It is referring <b>to</b> parts of the offering that become <b>dislodged</b> from the fire. <b>How so? </b> If the partially <b>consumed flesh</b> of a burnt offering is dislodged from the altar, <b>you return</b> it to the fire, <b>but you do not return</b> the partially <b>consumed sinews and bones</b> that become dislodged. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | As it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of the Lord your God” | Menachot 44b:11 | Apropos this statement, <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to all</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood is to be <b>placed on the external altar that</b> if <b>one placed their</b> blood <b>with one</b> act of <b>placement, </b> as opposed to the two or four that are required depending upon the offering, <b>that</b> the offering has nevertheless <b>effected atonement</b> after the fact, i.e., one has fulfilled his obligation to bring the offering? <b>As it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27). |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, | Nazir 25a:4 | With regard to these animals, <b>what is their</b> means of <b>remedy? “You shall take and go to the place that YHWH shall choose”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:26). One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that <b>he must bring them up to the Temple, and</b> yet he does not sacrifice them but <b>withholds water and food from them so that they should die. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God; and the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of YHWH your God, and you shall eat the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:27). |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | “And you shall sacrifice your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, | Pesachim 77a:16 | On the basis of these two assumptions, <b>let us say</b> that <b>the Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall sacrifice your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God, and the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar of YHWH your God, and you shall eat the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:27), that <b>R' Yehoshua says: If there is no blood</b> that is fit to be sprinkled on the altar, due to the fact that it became ritually impure or was lost, <b>there is no meat, </b> as the meat is also disqualified. Similarly, <b>if there is no meat</b> that is fit for use, due to the fact that it became ritually impure or was lost, <b>there is no blood</b> sprinkled on the altar, and the offering does not bring atonement. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | as it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out | Sanhedrin 4a:7 | With regard to <b>Beit Shammai, </b> the proof that they also hold that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative is <b>as we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 36b): <b>Beit Shammai say: </b> With regard to <b>all</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood must be <b>presented on the external altar, </b> once the blood has been <b>presented with one presentation</b> the offering <b>has effected atonement, </b> even if more presentations are ideally required, <b>as it is stated: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured out</b> against the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). This verse teaches that even with regard to a burnt-offering, which requires multiple presentations of the blood, a single presentation is sufficient to render the offering valid after the fact. <b>But with regard to a sin-offering, </b> it is valid only if there were at least <b>two presentations. And Beit Hillel say: Even with regard to a sin-offering that one presented with one presentation, it has effected atonement</b> after the fact. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, | Zevachim 104a:4 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that R' Yehuda HaNasi and R' Elazar <b>disagree about</b> the same principle as do <b>R' Eliezer and R' Yehoshua? </b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, </b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). <b>R' Yehoshua says: </b> The verse teaches that <b>if there is no blood</b> sprinkled on the altar, <b>no flesh</b> may be burned on the altar, and <b>if there is no flesh</b> to be burned on the altar, <b>no blood</b> may be sprinkled on the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | with one placement, he facilitated atonement? The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured | Zevachim 36b:20 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> those offerings whose blood is <b>placed on the external altar, that</b> if the priest <b>placed</b> the blood <b>with one placement, he facilitated atonement? The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured</b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27), indicating that a single pouring of blood suffices. The Talmud asks: <b>But does this</b> verse <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> discussing a different matter: |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured | Zevachim 37a:1 | <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that all</b> the <b>blood</b> that is left over from an offering after the requisite placement <b>requires placement of blood on the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured</b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). The Talmud answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> this <b>from</b> the verse cited <b>by R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> with regard to a verse discussing a bird sin offering: <b>“And the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “of the blood, ”</b> because the entire verse is talking about the blood, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “of the blood”? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured | Zevachim 37a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But still, </b> does <b>this</b> verse, Deuteronomy 12:27, <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that if a priest placed the blood with one placement, he facilitated atonement? <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> those offerings whose blood is supposed to be <b>placed by</b> means of <b>sprinkling</b> from a certain distance from the altar, <b>that</b> if the priest <b>placed</b> the blood <b>by pouring</b> it from up close <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured</b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | and a Paschal offering? The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured | Zevachim 37a:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>Still, </b> does <b>this</b> verse, Deuteronomy 12:27, <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that if a priest placed the blood with one placement he facilitated atonement? That verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yishmael says: Since it is stated: “But the firstborn of a bull, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, </b> you shall not redeem; they are sacred. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for an aroma pleasing to YHWH” (Numbers 18:17), <b>we learned with regard to a firstborn</b> animal, which must be given to a priest to be offered on the altar in the Temple, <b>that it requires placement of</b> its <b>blood and sacrificial portions on the altar. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>and a Paschal offering? The verse states: “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured</b> upon the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27). This verse teaches that all offerings require placement of their blood on the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured” | Zevachim 37b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>all those <i>tanna’im</i> who derive a different exposition from this</b> verse: <b>“And the blood of your offerings shall be poured”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that is recorded in the Mishnah, that with regard to <b>all</b> the offerings <b>whose</b> blood is to be <b>placed on the external altar, </b> in a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>placed</b> the blood on the altar with <b>one placement, he facilitated atonement, from where do they</b> derive this? The Talmud answers: Those <i>tanna’im</i> <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, who say: Even</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, </b> in a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>placed</b> the blood with <b>one placement, he facilitated atonement</b> after the fact. <b>And they derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> applying to <b>all</b> the other offerings <b>from</b> that which applies to <b>a sin offering. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | and the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar | Zevachim 52b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>You said</b> this, <b>but from where did you come? </b> In other words, why would one think that such an offering is valid, so that the verse needs to teach that it is not? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From the fact that it is stated: </b> “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of YHWH your God; <b>and the blood of your offerings shall be poured out against the altar</b> of YHWH your God, and you shall eat the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:27), <b>we learned</b> that <b>with regard to</b> those offerings whose blood is <b>placed with four placements</b> on the corners of the altar, <b>that if</b> the priest <b>placed them with</b> only <b>one placement, he has effected atonement. </b> Therefore, since it is derived that if the priest does not present the blood on the specified corners of the altar, the offering is nevertheless valid, one <b>might</b> have thought that blood <b>that</b> should have been <b>placed above</b> the red line but <b>that one placed below</b> the red line <b>effects atonement as well, </b> and the offering is valid. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood” | Zevachim 62b:10 | § <b>R' Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya asked R' Yosei: </b> Is it so that <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai used to say</b> that <b>there is airspace, </b> i.e., a gap, <b>between the ramp and the altar? </b> R' Yosei <b>said to him: And you, don’t you say so</b> as well? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27)? The verse juxtaposes the flesh of the burnt offering with its blood to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>blood</b> is presented upon the altar <b>via tossing</b> while the priest stands on the ground next to the altar (see Leviticus 1:5), <b>so too, </b> the <b>flesh</b> of the burnt offering is presented <b>via tossing. </b> In order to fulfill this requirement, the priest stands on the ramp and tosses the flesh over the gap between the ramp and the altar, so that it lands on the arrangement of wood. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | they shall not ascend, as it is stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood” | Zevachim 85b:16 | With regard to <b>the wool that is on the heads of the sheep</b> brought as burnt offerings, <b>and the hair that is in the beard of goats</b> that were sacrificed, <b>and the bones, and the tendons, and the horns, and the hooves: When they are attached</b> to the flesh of the offering <b>they shall ascend</b> upon the altar and be sacrificed with the offering, <b>as it is stated: “And the priest shall make the whole smoke</b> on the altar” (Leviticus 1:9). If <b>they separated</b> from the flesh of the offering <b>they shall not ascend, as it is stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), and nothing else. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood” | Zevachim 85b:17 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9). The term “the whole” serves <b>to include the bones and the tendons and the horns and the hooves</b> among those items that are sacrificed on the altar. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>they separated</b> from the flesh of the burnt offering they are sacrificed upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), indicating that only those items and anything attached to them are sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 12:27 | “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood” | Zevachim 86a:3 | <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), which indicates that only the flesh and blood of an offering ascend upon the altar? This verse is necessary <b>to tell you</b> an additional <i>halakha</i>, that <b>you return</b> the <b>consumed</b> flesh of <b>a burnt offering</b> to the fire if it is dislodged from it, <b>but you do not return</b> the <b>consumed tendons and bones</b> if they are dislodged from the fire. |
| Deuteronomy 12:28 | coerces him, and says to him: “Observe and hear” | Menachot 81b:13 | The Talmud cites a <i>baraita</i> in support of the response of Ḥizkiyya: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: </b> In a case involving <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering without loaves, or: </b> It is incumbent upon me to bring an animal <b>offering without libations, and</b> the rabbis <b>said to him: Bring a thanks offering with its loaves, or: </b> Bring an animal <b>offering with its libations, and he says: Had I known that such</b> is the requirement <b>I would not have vowed</b> at all; the <i>halakha</i> is that the court <b>coerces him, and says to him: “Observe and hear”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:28). |
| Deuteronomy 12:30 | How do these nations serve their gods? | Avodah Zarah51a:22 | § <b>R' Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who slaughters an animal</b> as an offering <b>to Mercury that he is liable</b> even though it is not typically worshipped in this manner? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore to the <i>se’irim</i></b> after whom they go astray; this shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>its</b> typical <b>manner, </b> it must apply to another matter. The verse cannot be referring to idols that are typically worshipped by slaughtering offerings, <b>as</b> this prohibition <b>is written</b> in the verse: “And lest you inquire after their gods, saying: <b>How do these nations serve their gods? </b> Even so will I do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30). One must therefore <b>apply</b> the verse to the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>an atypical manner. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:30 | serve | Sanhedrin 61a:5 | <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: According to what Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye, </b> that there is room to <b>say</b> that <b>bowing was singled out</b> in the verse <b>to teach, with regard to the entire category, </b> that any honorable form of worship carries the death penalty, there is a difficulty. With regard to the verse: “Take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them…saying, <b>how do</b> these nations <b>serve</b> their gods, so I will do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30), which indicates that one is liable for worshipping an idol in the manner that the non-Jews worship it, this is stated <b>to exclude what? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 12:30 | how do these nations serve | Sanhedrin 63a:6 | The Talmud asks: Why is a verse necessary <b>for</b> the prohibition against bowing to an idol for which bowing is <b>its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship? That prohibition <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the verse: “Take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them…saying, <b>how do these nations serve</b> their gods, so I will do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30), which indicates that one is liable for worshipping an idol in the manner that the non-Jews worship it. |
| Deuteronomy 12:30 | serve | Zevachim 106a:15 | The Talmud questions the use of this verse as a source: But <b>this</b> verse is <b>necessary for</b> the purpose of expounding <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of R' Elazar, as he says: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who slaughters an animal</b> as an offering <b>to Mercury, </b> a pagan deity, <b>that he is liable</b> even though this is not the established manner in which that deity is worshipped? <b>As it is written: </b> “And <b>they shall not slaughter anymore their offerings</b> to the <i>se’irim</i>. ” <b>If</b> the verse <b>is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter of</b> worshipping a deity <b>in accordance with its established manner, </b> as it is already taught that one is liable for this, <b>as it is written: </b> “Take heed to yourself…lest you inquire after their gods, saying: <b>How do these</b> nations <b>serve</b> their gods, so too will I do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30), then <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> worshipping a deity in a way <b>that</b> is <b>not in accordance with its established manner. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:1 | five on the second day of the Festival, | Chagigah 8b:11 | § <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: </b> If one <b>separated ten animals for</b> the purpose of <b>his Festival peace-</b>offering, and <b>he sacrificed five</b> of them <b>on the first</b> day of <b>the Festival, he may return and sacrifice</b> the remaining <b>five on the second day of the Festival, </b> or on any of the other days. There is no concern for the prohibition of: “You shall not add” (Deuteronomy 13:1), as though he were celebrating the first day twice, because the remaining offerings merely complete the first day’s offerings. <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Since he stopped</b> after the first five offerings on the day on which he first brought the Festival peace-offerings, <b>he may no longer sacrifice</b> the remaining animals on the other days, as that would be considered celebrating an extra day. |
| Deuteronomy 13:1 | Do not add | Eruvin 100a:18 | <b>R' Eliezer said to</b> R' Yehoshua: If one sprinkles the blood only once, <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition <b>“you shall not diminish, ”</b> which prohibits the omission of any elements of the performance of a mitzva, as he has not sprinkled the blood of the burnt-offering in the proper manner. <b>R' Yehoshua said to</b> R' Eliezer: According to your ruling, that one must sprinkle the blood four times, <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not add</b> (Deuteronomy 13:1), which prohibits the addition of elements to a mitzva, as he sprinkles the blood of the firstborn animal more times than necessary. |
| Deuteronomy 13:1 | Do not diminish, | Zevachim 80a:3 | <b>R' Eliezer said to</b> R' Yehoshua: According to your opinion, the priest <b>violates</b> the prohibition of: <b>Do not diminish, </b> as it is written: “All these matters that I command you, that you shall observe to do; you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it” (Deuteronomy 13:1). One may not diminish the number of required placements from four to one. <b>R' Yehoshua said to</b> R' Eliezer: According to your opinion, the priest <b>violates</b> the prohibition of: <b>Do not add, </b> derived from the same verse. One may not add to the one required placement and place four. |
| Deuteronomy 13:2 | nothing other than a prophet, as it is stated: “And he gives you a sign or a wonder” | Horayot 13a:12 | <b>A High Priest precedes a prophet, as it is stated: “And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there”</b> (I Kings 1:34); <b>Zadok</b> is written <b>before Natan. And</b> similarly, the prophet <b>says: “Hear now, Joshua the High Priest, you and your colleagues</b> who sit before you, for they are men that are a sign; for behold, I will bring forth My servant Zemah” (Zechariah 3:8). One <b>might</b> have thought that these colleagues <b>were laymen. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For they are men that are a sign, ” and “sign”</b> means <b>nothing other than a prophet, as it is stated: “And he gives you a sign or a wonder”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:2). |
| Deuteronomy 13:5 | which is written: “After the Lord your God shall you walk, | Sotah 14a:3 | <b>And R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “After YHWH your God shall you walk, </b> and Him shall you fear, and His commandments shall you keep, and unto His voice shall you hearken, and Him shall you serve, and unto Him shall you cleave” (Deuteronomy 13:5)? <b>But is it</b> actually <b>possible for a person to follow the Shekhina? But hasn’t it already been stated: “For YHWH your God is a devouring fire, </b> a jealous God” (Deuteronomy 4:24), and one cannot approach fire. |
| Deuteronomy 13:5 | “After the Lord your God you shall walk” | Sotah 39b:9 | The Talmud comments: <b>And they do not disagree</b> about the <i>halakha</i>. Rather, they were discussing different situations. <b>This</b> statement of R' Yehoshua ben Levi is referring to a case <b>where there is another exit. </b> When the Torah scroll is being taken out of one exit, people may leave through the other exit. However, <b>that</b> statement of Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where there is no other exit, </b> and therefore the congregation must wait until the Torah is carried out. <b>Rava said: </b> The Sage <b>bar Ahina explained to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: <b>“After YHWH your God you shall walk”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:5), meaning that one must walk after the Torah scroll and not in front of it. |
| Deuteronomy 13:6 | “And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst” | Chullin 139a:1 | how could it be free to rest on its eggs? <b>It is subject</b> to being <b>killed</b> and should have been executed. <b>Rather, </b> it must be a case <b>where its verdict was not</b> yet <b>issued, and</b> one is <b>required to bring it to the court to fulfill through it</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6). |
| Deuteronomy 13:6 | “And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst” | Chullin 140a:13 | <b>Ravina said: Here we are dealing with a bird that killed a person</b> and is therefore subject to being killed. The verse indicates that such a bird is unfit for use in the metzora’s ritual. The Talmud asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where its verdict</b> of execution <b>was issued, </b> then <b>it is subject</b> to being <b>killed, </b> and there is no need for the verse to teach that it cannot be used in the ritual. <b>Rather, </b> it must be referring to a bird <b>before its verdict</b> of execution <b>was issued. And for what</b> function does the verse exclude such a bird? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> exclude the bird from <b>sending</b> away, this is unnecessary, since one is <b>required to bring it to the court to fulfill</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6). Obviously, one may not send it away. <b>Rather, </b> the verse serves <b>to</b> disqualify such a bird for <b>slaughter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:6 | as it is written: “And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst” | Sanhedrin 78a:10 | The Talmud explains: In the case of a <i>tereifa</i> who killed <b>before</b> the <b>court, what is the reason</b> that he is <b>liable? </b> He is liable, <b>as it is written: “And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6), from which it is derived that there is a mitzva for the court to eradicate evil that it witnesses firsthand. In the case where the killing was <b>not before</b> the judges in <b>court, </b> he is <b>exempt, as</b> any testimony against the <i>tereifa</i> <b>is testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony. Even if the witnesses testifying that the <i>tereifa</i> committed murder are found to be conspiring witnesses, they cannot be executed, as they conspired to kill a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And any testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is not characterized as testimony, </b> and is not accepted in court. |
| Deuteronomy 13:6 | it is stated here: “And any non-priest who approaches shall be put to death [ yumat ]” and it is stated there: “And that prophet or that dreamer of a dream shall be put to death [ yumat ]” | Sanhedrin 84a:14 | <b>R' Akiva says</b> that <b>it is stated here: “And any non-priest who approaches shall be put to death [<i>yumat</i>]” and it is stated there: “And that prophet or that dreamer of a dream shall be put to death [<i>yumat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to the prophet, he is executed <b>by stoning, so too here, </b> a non-priest who performs the Temple service is executed <b>by stoning. R' Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: Just as there, </b> with regard to the prophet, he is executed <b>by strangulation, so too here, </b> a non-priest who performs the Temple service is executed <b>by strangulation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:6 | from the way | Sanhedrin 90a:1 | <b>The dispute is with regard to</b> a prophet who prophesies to <b>abolish the essence of</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship, or</b> a prophet who espouses <b>fulfillment</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>and nullification</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>of idol worship, </b> asserting that idol worship is permitted in certain circumstances, <b>as God says: </b> “And that prophet…shall be put to death; because he has spoken perversion against YHWH…to divert you <b>from the way</b> on which YHWH your God commanded you to walk” (Deuteronomy 13:6). It may be inferred from this verse: If he diverts you <b>even</b> from <b>part of the way. </b> In these cases, R' Shimon holds that he is executed by strangulation, and the Rabbis hold that he is executed by stoning. |
| Deuteronomy 13:7 | seclusion? As it is stated: “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you” | Avodah Zarah36b:15 | The Talmud raises yet another difficulty: <b>Seclusion with a Jewish woman is</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon ben Yehotzadak: Where is there an allusion in the Torah to</b> the prohibition against <b>seclusion? As it is stated: “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:7). <b>And does only</b> a half brother who is <b>the son of a mother entice</b> one to sin, whereas <b>the son of a father does not entice? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:7 | But isn’t it written: “If your brother…entices you | Chullin 4b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>not</b> incitement with words? <b>But isn’t it written: “If your brother…entices you</b> secretly, saying: Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:7)? The Talmud answers: There too the incitement is <b>with eating and with drinking. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> that God said to Satan, who denounced Job: <b>“And you incited Me against him, to destroy him gratuitously”</b> (Job 2:3)? Clearly Satan did not incite God with food and drink. The Talmud answers: Incitement against the One <b>on High is different, </b> as the term is used metaphorically. By contrast, incitement with regard to people involves food and drink. |
| Deuteronomy 13:7 | “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you” | Kiddushin 80b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that it is prohibited for a man to be secluded with women, derived? <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Yishmael: From where</b> is there <b>an allusion from the</b> Written <b>Torah to</b> the prohibition against <b>seclusion? As it is stated</b> concerning one who incites others to idolatrous worship: <b>“If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:7). |
| Deuteronomy 13:7 | As it is stated: “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you” | Sanhedrin 21b:2 | The Talmud objects: <b>Seclusion</b> with a woman forbidden by familial ties <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, and was not a rabbinic decree issued in the time of David. <b>As R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon ben Yehotzadak: From where</b> is there <b>an allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>seclusion</b> is forbidden <b>by Torah</b> law? <b>As it is stated: “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:7). One can ask: <b>But does the son of a mother entice, and does the son of a father not entice? </b> Why mention only the son of a mother? <b>Rather, </b> this verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that only <b>a son</b> may <b>be secluded with his mother. </b> Sons are frequently with their mother, and two half-brothers of one mother consequently have the opportunity to grow close to one another. <b>But another</b> individual <b>may not be secluded with those with whom sex are forbidden by the Torah, </b> including a stepmother. Therefore, half-brothers of one father spend less time together. |
| Deuteronomy 13:7 | incites you | Sanhedrin 61b:4 | <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rav Yosef’s opinion: <b>Is</b> there <b>a difference</b> in <i>halakha</i> <b>between</b> the cases of <b>an incited multitude</b> of people <b>and an individual</b> who was <b>incited? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“If your brother, the son of your mother, </b> or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your neighbor who is like your own soul, <b>incites you</b> secretly, saying: Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:7), that <b>both an individual</b> who was <b>incited and an incited multitude</b> of people are included in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>but the verse singles out the individual from the category of the multitude, and</b> another verse singles out <b>the multitude from the category of the individual. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “You shall neither spare nor conceal him” | Makkot 12a:17 | The Talmud rejects that understanding. <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it in that manner? <b>Both according to the one who says</b> that there is <b>a mitzva</b> for the blood redeemer to kill the unintentional murderer <b>and according to the one who says</b> that it is <b>optional, is it permitted</b> for a son to do so? <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar Rav Huna say, and likewise the school of R' Yishmael taught: With regard to all</b> transgressions of the Torah, even if the father is liable to receive lashes or be ostracized, <b>a son does not become an agent</b> of the court <b>to flog his father or to curse him, apart from</b> the case of a father who acted as <b>one who incites</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>as the Torah states</b> in his regard: <b>“You shall neither spare nor conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9)? |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him” | Sanhedrin 29a:31 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>an inciter, </b> that the court does not seek to deem him innocent? <b>R' Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: I heard at the lecture of R' Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> that <b>an inciter is different, as God states</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). In this unique case, the court is not required to try to deem him innocent. |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him” | Sanhedrin 33b:7 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi says: And the opposite of this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to one who entices</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). He is brought back to court to find him liable, but not to acquit him. <b>Rav Kahana teaches</b> this last <i>halakha</i> citing a different verse concerning the enticer: <b>“But you shall kill him [<i>harog tahargennu</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:10). The repetition of the verb indicates that he is killed even in circumstances where transgressors of other prohibitions would not be. |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him” | Sanhedrin 36b:5 | The Talmud answers: <b>But there is another</b> difference, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:5): The court <b>does not seat on the Sanhedrin</b> a very <b>old person or one who is castrated or one who has no children, </b> as those who did not recently raise children may lack compassion. <b>R' Yehuda adds: Even a cruel person</b> is not eligible. The Talmud comments: <b>And the opposite of this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to one who entices</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>as God states</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him” | Sanhedrin 43a:21 | <b>Ulla said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> this proof? Was <b>Jesus the Nazarene worthy of</b> conducting <b>a search</b> for a reason to <b>acquit</b> him? <b>He</b> was <b>an inciter</b> to idol worship, <b>and God states</b> with regard to an inciter to idol worship: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). <b>Rather, Jesus was different, as he</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government, </b> and the non-Jew authorities were interested in his acquittal. Consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself, so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted. |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | “You shall not approve of him, nor listen to him” | Sanhedrin 61b:3 | <b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable for merely stating that he will worship an idol is referring to an individual who was incited? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to one who incites people to engage in idol worship: <b>“You shall not approve of him, nor listen to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9), which indicates that if one <b>approved</b> of <b>and listened</b> to the inciter, stating his intention to engage in idol worship, he is <b>liable</b> even if he does not actually worship an idol. |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | As it is written: “You shall not approve of him, nor listen to him” | Sanhedrin 61b:9 | <b>Abaye said: From where do I say</b> that this distinction is correct? <b>As it is written: “You shall not approve of him, nor listen to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9), referring to another individual who tried to incite him, and the verse indicates that if one <b>approved</b> of <b>and listened</b> to the inciter, he is <b>liable</b> even for the approval alone. |
| Deuteronomy 13:9 | as the Torah states: “Neither shall you spare, nor shall you conceal him” | Sanhedrin 85b:2 | Despite several attempts to cite proof contradicting his opinion, there is no conclusive refutation of the statement of Rav Sheshet that a son may serve as an agent of the court to punish his father. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says, and likewise the school of R' Yishmael taught: With regard to all</b> cases <b>a son is not designated</b> as <b>an agent to strike his father or to curse him, except</b> in a case where his father <b>incites</b> others to worship idols, <b>as the Torah states: “Neither shall you spare, nor shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). |
| Deuteronomy 13:10 | “But you shall kill him [ harog tahargennu ]” | Sanhedrin 33b:7 | <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi says: And the opposite of this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to one who entices</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). He is brought back to court to find him liable, but not to acquit him. <b>Rav Kahana teaches</b> this last <i>halakha</i> citing a different verse concerning the enticer: <b>“But you shall kill him [<i>harog tahargennu</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:10). The repetition of the verb indicates that he is killed even in circumstances where transgressors of other prohibitions would not be. |
| Deuteronomy 13:12 | “And all Israel shall hear, and fear, | Sanhedrin 63b:7 | The Talmud asks: Why must the prohibition against <b>an inciter</b> be derived from here? <b>It is written explicitly in that regard, </b> in the verse concerning the inciter’s punishment: <b>“And all Israel shall hear, and fear, </b> and shall do no more of any such wickedness as this is in your midst” (Deuteronomy 13:12). This is clearly a prohibition against inciting others to worship idols. <b>Rather, </b> the verse “neither let it be heard out of your mouth” is <b>a prohibition against one who subverts</b> an entire city to engage in idol worship; this prohibition is not stated elsewhere. |
| Deuteronomy 13:13 | your cities, | Bava Kamma82b:8 | The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> it <b>cannot become an idolatrous city. </b> The reason is <b>that it is written, </b> in the introduction of the passage dealing with the <i>halakha</i> of an idolatrous city: “If you shall hear tell concerning one of <b>your cities, </b> which YHWH your God gives you to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 13:13). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is therefore not included in the description “one of your cities, which YHWH your God gives you to dwell there. ” |
| Deuteronomy 13:13 | one | Sanhedrin 16b:14 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And three</b> adjoining cities may <b>not</b> be designated as <b>idolatrous cities. </b> The source for this ruling is <b>as it is written: </b> “If you shall hear concerning <b>one</b> of your cities that YHWH your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 13:13), and not three cities. The Mishnah continues: <b>But</b> the court <b>may designate one</b> city, <b>or two</b> adjoining cities as idolatrous cities. The source for this is <b>as it is written: “Your cities, ”</b> in the plural. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“One, ”</b> from which it is inferred: <b>One, but not three. Do you say</b> that the meaning is <b>one, but not three, or rather, </b> is this <b>not</b> the meaning of the verse, that it is <b>one, but not two? </b> The <i>baraita</i> explains that this cannot be. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “Your cities, ” two are stated. How do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“One”? One, but not three. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | And it is written there: “Certain base men have gone out… | Bava Batra10a:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Anyone who turns his eyes away from</b> one seeking <b>charity is</b> considered <b>as if he worships idols. </b> From where is this derived? <b>It is written here: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart…</b>and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>And it is written there: “Certain base men have gone out…</b>and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the base men sin with <b>idolatry, so too here, </b> the base thought is treated like <b>idolatry. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | “ Benei beliya’al have gone out from your midst | Berakhot 31b:4 | <b>“Do not take your female slave as a wicked woman [<i>bat beliya’al</i>]</b> for out of the abundance of my complaint and anger have I spoken until now” (I Samuel 1:16). <b>R' Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that when a drunk person prays it is as if he engaged in idol worship</b> is derived as <b>it is written here</b> that Hannah, suspected of praying while drunk, defends herself and says: “Do not take your female slave <b>as a <i>bat beliya’al</i>”; </b> and <b>it is written there, </b> with regard to a city that has been instigated to engage in idol worship: <b>“<i>Benei beliya’al</i> have gone out from your midst</b> and have lured the inhabitants of their city, saying let us go and serve other gods which we have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). By means of this verbal analogy it is derived: <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of the idolatrous city, the term <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship, so too here, </b> in the case of one who prays drunk, <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | gone out” | Ketubot 68a:2 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught: R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who averts his eyes from the</b> obligation to give <b>charity, </b> it <b>is as if he engages in idol worship. </b> It is <b>written here</b> concerning charity: <b>“Beware that there be not a base [<i>beliya’al</i>] thought in your heart…</b>and you will not give him” (Deuteronomy 15:9), <b>and</b> it is <b>written there</b> concerning idolatry: <b>“Certain base [<i>beliya’al</i>] fellows</b> have <b>gone out”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>Just as there, </b> in the latter verse, the word “base [<i>beliya’al</i>]” is referring to <b>idol worship, so too here, </b> this expression indicates a sin on the scale of <b>idol worship. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 111b:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> an interpretation of the verse: “Certain men, wicked persons, are gone out from your midst, and have subverted the inhabitants of their city saying: Let us go and let us worship other gods that you have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). From the term <b>“are gone out”</b> it is derived that these <i>halakhot</i> apply only if <b>they, </b> the subverters themselves, subverted the residents, <b>but not agents</b> whom they designated to subvert. From the term <b>“men”</b> it is derived that <b>men</b> in the plural means <b>no less than two. Alternatively, </b> it is derived: <b>Men, but not women; men, but not children. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | The residents of an idolatrous city have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Certain men, wicked persons, are gone out from your midst, and have subverted the inhabitants of their city, saying: | Sanhedrin 111b:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>The residents of an idolatrous city have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Certain men, wicked persons, are gone out from your midst, and have subverted the inhabitants of their city, saying: </b> Let us go and let us worship other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>And</b> idol worshippers <b>are not executed</b> as residents of an idolatrous city <b>unless its subverters are from that city and from that tribe, and unless most of</b> the inhabitants of the city <b>are subverted, and unless men subvert</b> the inhabitants of the city. If it occurs that <b>women or children subvert</b> the inhabitants of the city, <b>or that a minority of</b> the inhabitants of the city <b>were subverted, or that its subverters were from outside</b> the city and were neither residents of that city nor members of that tribe, <b>these</b> idol worshippers <b>are</b> judged <b>as individuals. And</b> to judge the inhabitants of a city <b>one requires two witnesses and forewarning for each and every one</b> who engaged in idol worship. |
| Deuteronomy 13:14 | What is the reason | Sanhedrin 16b:13 | § The Mishnah teaches that the court <b>may not designate</b> a city as <b>an idolatrous city</b> if it is <b>on the frontier. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Talmud answers: The verse states: “Certain worthless people have gone out from your midst and have led astray the inhabitants of their city” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>God states</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies when they come <b>from your midst, </b> meaning from within your country, <b>but not from the frontier. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:15 | “And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently” | Sanhedrin 40a:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source for these seven interrogations? <b>Rav Yehuda says: </b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to an idolatrous city: <b>“And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:15); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to one who worships idols: <b>“If it be told to you and you have heard it and inquired diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:4); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And the judges shall inquire diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18). Taken together, there are seven interrogations alluded to in these verses by each instance of the terms inquire, investigate, and diligently. |
| Deuteronomy 13:15 | certain” | Sanhedrin 40b:9 | <b>Rather, Rav Yehuda said: </b> There are an additional two phrases in the verses that are used to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the seven interrogations. The verse states with regard to the idolatrous city: “And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently <b>and behold it be truth, </b> the matter <b>certain”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:15). Additionally, the verse states with regard to idol worship: “You have inquired diligently <b>and behold it be truth, </b> the matter <b>certain”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:4). When one adds the two usages of “truth” and “certain” to the seven expressions stated earlier, <b>consequently, </b> there are <b>eleven</b> expressions; <b>seven</b> are used <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>seven interrogations, </b> and of the four that remain, <b>remove three, </b> one for each verse, <b>for</b> the purpose of the <b>verbal analogy, </b> and <b>one remains. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | “You shall strike [ hakeh takeh ] | Bava Metzia31b:3 | With regard to an idolatrous city, it is written: <b>“You shall strike [<i>hakeh takeh</i>]</b> the inhabitants of that city by sword, destroying it utterly” (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the residents of the idolatrous city are executed <b>with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to them, </b> i.e., decapitation. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if you are unable to execute them with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to them, it is permitted for you to execute them with any death</b> with <b>which you are able to execute them? The verse states: “<i>Hakeh takeh</i>, ”</b> to teach that you must execute him <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | “You shall smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword” | Sanhedrin 111b:8 | From the verse: <b>“You shall smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16), it is derived that <b>the caravan of donkeys and the caravan of camels that move from place to place, these</b> donkey or camel drivers <b>save</b> the city. If they were residing in the city for a period, they could join the minority of permanent residents who were not subverted to idol worship in order to create a majority and prevent the destruction of the city and its contents. |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | It is stated: “Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it and its animals, with the edge of the sword” | Sanhedrin 111b:9 | <b>It is stated: “Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it and its animals, with the edge of the sword”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>From here, </b> the rabbis <b>stated: The property of the righteous, </b> who did not engage in idol worship, <b>that is inside</b> the city <b>is destroyed</b> with the rest of the city and its contents; but the property of the righteous <b>that is outside</b> the city <b>is spared. And</b> the property <b>of the wicked, whether</b> it is <b>inside</b> the city <b>or whether it is outside</b> the city, <b>these</b> items <b>are destroyed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | “Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it” | Sanhedrin 112a:10 | It is written: <b>“Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that which is written: <b>“Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it”; </b> this serves <b>to exclude the property of the righteous that is</b> located <b>outside</b> the city, which is not destroyed. <b>“And all that is in it”; </b> this serves <b>to include the property of the righteous that is</b> located <b>inside</b> the city; it is also destroyed. It is stated: “And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square” (Deuteronomy 13:17). From the term <b>“its spoils”</b> it is derived: <b>But not the spoils of Heaven; </b> all consecrated property is excluded. The phrase <b>“and</b> you shall gather <b>all of its spoils”</b> serves <b>to include the property of the wicked that is</b> located <b>outside</b> the city; it is also destroyed. |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | “You shall smite the inhabitants of that city | Sanhedrin 112a:7 | § It is written: <b>“You shall smite the inhabitants of that city</b> with the edge of the sword, destroy it utterly, and all that is in it and its animals, with the edge of the sword” (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The caravan of donkeys and the caravan of camels that move from place to place, </b> that <b>lodged in</b> the city <b>and were subverted with it, if they had stayed there thirty days they</b> are executed <b>by the sword and their property is destroyed. </b> If they had stayed there <b>less than that, they</b> are executed <b>by stoning, </b> as individual idolaters, <b>and their property is spared. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | “Its animals” | Sanhedrin 112b:1 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And the consecrated</b> property <b>in it must be redeemed. A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 14:5): <b>If there were offerings of the most sacred order in it, </b> if they were animals <b>consecrated for</b> sacrifice on <b>the altar, they shall die; </b> one causes their death. Items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance must be redeemed, and <i>terumot</i> must</b> be left to <b>decay, and second tithe and sacred scrolls must be interred. R' Shimon says: </b> That is not so; rather, the term: <b>“Its animals”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16), serves to <b>exclude a firstborn animal and</b> animal <b>tithe, </b> as they never belonged to the idolatrous city. The term: <b>“Its spoils”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), serves to <b>exclude consecrated money and tithe money. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:16 | with the edge of the sword” | Sanhedrin 52b:12 | § The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a Mishnah <b>in another chapter</b> of this tractate (76b): <b>These</b> transgressors <b>are those who are killed</b> by decapitation: <b>The murderer and the people of an idolatrous city, </b> there is a difficulty. <b>Granted, </b> the people of <b>an idolatrous city</b> are executed in this manner, as <b>it is written concerning them: </b> “You shall smite the inhabitants of that city <b>with the edge of the sword”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a murderer, from where do we</b> derive that he is executed by decapitation? |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | as it is written: “And you shall gather all its spoil into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn | Chullin 89a:12 | <b>Ze’eiri said: </b> R' Zeira is not referring to the ashes of the burned city, which may not be used. Rather, his statement is <b>necessary only concerning the dust of its dust, </b> i.e., the dust of the ground of the idolatrous city, from which deriving benefit is not prohibited, <b>as it is written: “And you shall gather all its spoil into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn</b> with fire the city” (Deuteronomy 13:17). Accordingly, items <b>lacking only</b> the acts of <b>gathering and burning</b> must be burned. This serves to exclude <b>this</b> dust of the ground, <b>which lacks</b> the acts of <b>removal</b> from the ground, <b>gathering, and burning. </b> The dust must also be removed from the ground before it can be gathered and burned. |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | It is stated: “And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square” | Sanhedrin 111b:10 | <b>It is stated: “And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17). <b>If</b> the city <b>has no square, one creates a square for</b> the city in order to fulfill the mitzva as it is written. <b>If there was a square outside of</b> the city, <b>they bring it inside</b> the city by expanding the city wall to include the square. |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | “And it shall be a heap forever” | Sanhedrin 111b:13 | It is written: <b>“And it shall be a heap forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), meaning: The idolatrous city <b>shall not be converted</b> even into <b>gardens and orchards; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili. R' Akiva says: </b> From the end of that verse: <b>“It shall not be built again, ”</b> it is derived: To restore it <b>to the way it was</b> before destruction, <b>it</b> may <b>not</b> be <b>built; but it may be converted into gardens and orchards. </b> The next verse states: <b>“And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). This teaches that <b>as long as the wicked</b> exist <b>in the world, </b> there is <b>wrath in the world; </b> once <b>the wicked are eliminated from the world, wrath leaves the world. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | inside | Sanhedrin 112a:10 | It is written: <b>“Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that which is written: <b>“Destroy it utterly, and all that is in it”; </b> this serves <b>to exclude the property of the righteous that is</b> located <b>outside</b> the city, which is not destroyed. <b>“And all that is in it”; </b> this serves <b>to include the property of the righteous that is</b> located <b>inside</b> the city; it is also destroyed. It is stated: “And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square” (Deuteronomy 13:17). From the term <b>“its spoils”</b> it is derived: <b>But not the spoils of Heaven; </b> all consecrated property is excluded. The phrase <b>“and</b> you shall gather <b>all of its spoils”</b> serves <b>to include the property of the wicked that is</b> located <b>outside</b> the city; it is also destroyed. |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | “And you shall gather…and you shall burn” | Sanhedrin 112a:16 | <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma: What is</b> the status of <b>the hair of pious women</b> in the idolatrous city; must it be destroyed? <b>Rava says: </b> Is that to say <b>that the hair of wicked</b> women is <b>forbidden</b> and must be destroyed? <b>“And you shall gather…and you shall burn”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), <b>is written, </b> and it is derived: An item <b>that is lacking, </b> i.e., that requires, <b>only gathering and burning</b> must be destroyed, <b>excluding this</b> hair, <b>which is lacking detaching, gathering, and burning. </b> Therefore, even the hair of a wicked woman is not forbidden. |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | “And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square” | Sanhedrin 112a:18 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall gather all of its spoils into the midst of its square”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), <b>A baraita states: </b> If the city <b>has no square, it does not become an idolatrous city, </b> as it does not fulfill the criterion mandated by the verse; this is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. R' Akiva says: </b> If the city <b>has no square, one creates a square for</b> the city. The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? </b> The Talmud explains: One <b>Sage, </b> R' Yishmael, <b>holds “its square” indicates</b> a square that existed <b>from the outset. And</b> one <b>Sage, </b> R' Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>“its square”</b> can <b>also indicate</b> a square that was created <b>now. </b> |

| Deuteronomy 13:17 | of Rabbi Avin. | Sanhedrin 113a:5 | On that basis, say that the dispute is <b>that</b> one <b>Sage, </b> R' Yosei HaGelili, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of R' Avin, and</b> one <b>Sage, </b> R' Akiva, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of R' Avin. </b> R' Yosei HaGelili holds that the positive mitzva: “And it shall be a heap forever,” and the succeeding prohibition: “It shall not be built again” (Deuteronomy 13:17), are independent mitzvot. The result is that the city must remain a heap and may not be converted into gardens and orchards. R' Akiva employs the hermeneutical principle and deduces that the generalization “and it shall be a heap forever” means only that “it shall not be built again,” but converting the ruins of the idolatrous city into gardens and orchards is permitted. |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | hear | Sanhedrin 45b:17 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an idolatrous city, the majority of whose inhabitants engaged in idol worship, about which the verse states: “And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the open place of the city, and shall burn with fire both the city and the entire plunder taken in it” (Deuteronomy 13:17): If the city <b>does not have an open place, it is not rendered an idolatrous city; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. R' Akiva says: </b> If <b>it does not have an open place, they make an open place for it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:17 | The verse states: “And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the open space of the city, and shall burn with fire | Sanhedrin 71a:17 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a city that has even one <i>mezuza</i> cannot become an idolatrous city? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the open space of the city, and shall burn with fire</b> both the city and the entire plunder taken in it” (Deuteronomy 13:17). <b>And since if there is a <i>mezuza</i></b> there <b>it is impossible</b> to burn all the contents of the city, <b>as it is written: </b> “And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their <i>asherim</i> with fire…<b>This you shall not do so to YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3–4). It is derived from this verse that it is prohibited to destroy a sacred item such as a <i>mezuza</i>. Therefore, in a city that has even one <i>mezuza</i>, it is impossible to fulfill the <i>halakhot</i> of an idolatrous city, as not all of its contents may be burned. <b>R' Yonatan says: </b> This is not so, as <b>I</b> once <b>saw</b> an idolatrous city that was condemned to destruction, <b>and I</b> even <b>sat on its ruins. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | As the verse states: “And there shall cleave nothing dedicated to your hand” | Avodah Zarah12b:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: They taught</b> that buying is prohibited <b>only</b> in the case of stores that are <b>adorned with roses and myrtle, as one derives benefit from</b> their <b>smell</b> and they serve as offerings to objects of idol worship. <b>But</b> with regard to stores that are <b>adorned with fruit, </b> it is <b>permitted</b> to buy from them. <b>What is the reason</b> that they are permitted? <b>As the verse states: “And there shall cleave nothing dedicated to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), i.e., the items dedicated to idol worship. From here it is derived that <b>it is prohibited</b> to <b>derive benefit</b> from idol worship, |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | to your hand” | Avodah Zarah34b:15 | <b>If you wish, cite a verse: It is written here, </b> with regard to an animal used for idol worship: <b>“And there shall cleave naught</b> of the dedicated thing <b>to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), which indicates that the entire animal is forbidden. <b>And it is written there, </b> with regard to an ox to be stoned: <b>“The ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 21:28). This teaches that <b>its flesh is forbidden, but its excrement is permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand” | Avodah Zarah42a:17 | R' Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a Mishnah (43a): <b>R' Yosei says: </b> When one encounters an idol, he should <b>grind</b> the idol <b>and throw</b> the dust <b>to the wind or cast</b> it <b>into the sea. </b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: </b> What is the good of that? <b>That also</b> gives a Jew benefit from the idol, as it <b>becomes fertilizer</b> for his crops, <b>and</b> deriving any kind of benefit is prohibited, as <b>it is written: </b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). R' Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this prohibited? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand” | Avodah Zarah43b:19 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>R' Yosei says: </b> When one encounters an idol, he should <b>grind</b> the idol <b>and throw</b> the dust <b>to the wind or cast</b> it <b>into the sea. </b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: </b> What is the good of that? <b>That also</b> gives a Jew benefit from the idol, as it <b>becomes fertilizer</b> for his crops, <b>and</b> deriving any kind of benefit is prohibited, as <b>it is stated: </b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand” | Avodah Zarah44b:1 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> A wise non-Jew, <b>Proclus ben Plospus, </b> once <b>asked</b> a question <b>of Rabban Gamliel in</b> the city of <b>Akko when he was bathing in the bathhouse of</b> the Greek god <b>Aphrodite. </b> Proclus <b>said to him: It is written in your Torah: </b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). <b>For what reason do you bathe</b> before an idol <b>in the bathhouse of Aphrodite? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand” | Avodah Zarah48b:13 | <b>Didn’t we hear</b> that <b>they</b> stated <b>the opposite</b> rulings? <b>As we learned</b> in a Mishnah (43b): <b>R' Yosei says: </b> When one encounters an idol, he should <b>grind</b> the idol <b>and throw</b> the dust <b>to the wind or cast</b> it <b>into the sea. </b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: </b> What is the good of that? <b>That also</b> gives a Jew benefit from the idol, as it <b>becomes fertilizer</b> for his crops, <b>and</b> deriving any kind of benefit is prohibited, as <b>it is written: </b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | but they came from the mixed multitude, as it is written: “And show you compassion, and have compassion upon you, | Beitzah 32b:4 | <b>He said: These</b> wealthy people are not descendants of our forefathers, <b>but they came from the mixed multitude, as it is written: “And show you compassion, and have compassion upon you, </b> and multiply you, as He has sworn to your fathers” (Deuteronomy 13:18), from which it is derived: <b>Anyone who has compassion</b> for God’s <b>creatures, it is known that he is of the descendants of Abraham, our father, and anyone who does not have compassion</b> for God’s <b>creatures, it is known that he is not of the descendants of Abraham, our father. </b> Since these wealthy Babylonians do not have compassion on people, clearly they are not descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | benefit is prohibited, | Chullin 89a:11 | § The Talmud returns to discuss the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>R' Zeira says, and some say Rabba bar Yirmeya</b> says: <b>One may cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>with the dust of an idolatrous city. </b> The Torah states that the city and anything contained therein must be burned (see Deuteronomy 13:17). The Talmud, assuming the statement of R' Zeira refers to the ashes of a burned idolatrous city, asks: <b>But why</b> may one use these ashes to cover the blood? <b>These</b> ashes <b>are items from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited, </b> as the verse states: “And there shall cleave none of the banned property to your hand” (Deuteronomy 13:18). |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | shall cleave to your hand” | Makkot 22a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>But didn’t R' Ḥiyya teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> that summarizes the prohibitions listed in this Mishnah: <b>One is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes <b>for his eating and three</b> sets of lashes <b>for his cooking? And if it is so, </b> that the prohibition of kindling a fire is replaced with the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve of an unslaughtered animal carcass, <b>he is liable</b> to receive <b>three</b> sets of lashes <b>for his eating; </b> for eating a sciatic nerve, for eating meat cooked in milk, and for eating an unslaughtered animal carcass. <b>Rather, </b> say: <b>Remove kindling</b> from the list of prohibitions, <b>and insert</b> the prohibition of using <b>wood of a tree</b> worshipped as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>], whose prohibition is</b> derived <b>from here: “And</b> nothing of the dedicated item <b>shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), indicating that it is forbidden to derive benefit from accoutrements of idol worship. |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | to your hand” | Makkot 22a:9 | <b>Rav Ashi objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate one who plows with</b> a plow crafted from the <b>wood of an <i>ashera</i>, and its prohibition is from here: “And there shall cleave nothing</b> of the dedicated item <b>to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | “Nothing from the spoil shall cling to your hand” | Pesachim 48a:5 | <b>Rather, </b> in order to make this <i>baraita</i> consistent with Rabba’s opinion, <b>remove</b> the prohibition of <b>kindling</b> a fire <b>and add</b> in its place the prohibition of using <b>the wood of a tree designated for idolatry [<i>asheira</i>]. And the warning, </b> i.e., the source of the negative commandment associated with using this wood, <b>is</b> derived <b>from here, </b> a verse that relates to an idolatrous city that is burned: <b>“Nothing from the spoil shall cling to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | “And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand” | Sanhedrin 111b:13 | It is written: <b>“And it shall be a heap forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:17), meaning: The idolatrous city <b>shall not be converted</b> even into <b>gardens and orchards; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili. R' Akiva says: </b> From the end of that verse: <b>“It shall not be built again, ”</b> it is derived: To restore it <b>to the way it was</b> before destruction, <b>it</b> may <b>not</b> be <b>built; but it may be converted into gardens and orchards. </b> The next verse states: <b>“And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). This teaches that <b>as long as the wicked</b> exist <b>in the world, </b> there is <b>wrath in the world; </b> once <b>the wicked are eliminated from the world, wrath leaves the world. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | “And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand” | Sanhedrin 113b:2 | § The Mishnah teaches with regard to the verse: <b>“And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), <b>as long as the wicked</b> exist <b>in the world, </b> there is <b>wrath in the world. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Who are</b> these <b>wicked</b> people mentioned in the Mishnah? <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> They are <b>thieves. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | “And He will show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you” | Shabbat 151b:14 | In a similar vein, the Talmud relates that <b>R' Ḥiyya said to his wife: When a poor person comes</b> to the house, <b>be quick to give him bread so that they will be quick</b> to give bread <b>to your children. She said to him: </b> Are <b>you cursing them, </b> your children? <b>He said to her: It is a verse that is written, </b> as it says: <b>“Due to this thing, ” and the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> that <b>it is a wheel that</b> continuously <b>turns in the world. </b> Similarly, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Gamliel, son of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says: </b> The verse that states: <b>“And He will show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18) teaches us that <b>anyone who has compassion for</b> God’s <b>creatures will receive compassion from Heaven, and anyone who does not have compassion for</b> God’s <b>creatures will not receive compassion from Heaven. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | any amount, as it is stated: “And there shall cleave nothing of the proscribed items to your hand” | Shabbat 90a:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>pepper</b> on Shabbat is <b>any amount. </b> Similarly, the measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>tar</b> is <b>any amount. </b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out various <b>kinds of perfumes and</b> various <b>kinds of metals</b> is <b>any amount. </b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>stones of the altar or earth of the altar, </b> sacred scrolls or their coverings that became tattered due to an insect called <b><i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>scrolls, and <i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>their coverings, </b> is <b>any amount. That</b> is because people <b>store them</b> in order <b>to bury them, </b> due to their sanctity, and accord significance to even a small measure of those items. <b>R' Yehuda says: Even one who carries out accessories of idolatry</b> on Shabbat is liable for carrying out <b>any amount, as it is stated: “And there shall cleave nothing of the proscribed items to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). Since even the smallest amount is prohibited and must be burned, any amount is significant. |
| Deuteronomy 13:18 | merciful, as it is written: “And He will give you mercy, and have mercy upon you and multiply you” | Yevamot 79a:3 | David <b>said: There are three distinguishing marks of this nation, </b> the Jewish people. They are <b>merciful, </b> they are <b>shamefaced, and they perform acts of kindness. </b> <b>They are <b>merciful, as it is written: “And He will give you mercy, and have mercy upon you and multiply you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18); not only will God have mercy upon you, but He will bestow the attribute of mercy upon you. <b>They are <b>shamefaced, as it is written: “And that His fear shall be upon your faces”</b> (Exodus 20:17), and the fear that is on one’s face is his shame. <b><b>They perform acts of kindness, as it is written: </b> “For I have known him, <b>to the end that he may command his children and his household</b> after him, that they may keep the way of YHWH, to practice righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19), i.e., to perform acts of kindness. <br><b>Whoever has these three distinguishing marks is fit to cleave to this nation. </b> Those who lack these qualities, however, are unfit to be part of the Jewish people. When David saw the cruelty of the Gibeonites, he decreed that they may never enter into the congregation of Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of the Lord your God” | Bava Batra10a:4 | <b>R' Akiva said to</b> Turnus Rufus: <b>I will illustrate</b> the opposite <b>to you with a</b> different <b>parable. To what is this matter comparable? </b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his son and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard</b> about this once his anger abated, <b>would he not</b> react by <b>sending</b> that person <b>a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1). |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | “You are the sons | Kiddushin 36a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And both Abaye and Rava, what do they derive from this</b> verse: <b>“You are the sons</b> to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1)? According to the first explanation of Isi’s opinion, the exclusion of women is derived from this phrase, whereas they derive that <i>halakha</i> from a different source. The Talmud answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“You are the sons to YHWH your God, ”</b> indicates that <b>when you act like sons</b> and cleave to God, <b>you are called sons, </b> but when <b>you do not act like sons you are not called sons. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | Because it is stated: “You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead” | Kiddushin 36a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Upon their head”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), with regard to the prohibition against a priest causing baldness? <b>Because it is stated: “You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he is obligated only for</b> removing the hair <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the entire head</b> in this prohibition? When <b>the verse states “upon their head, ”</b> it serves <b>to render</b> a priest <b>liable</b> for removing hair <b>on</b> his entire <b>head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | Since it is stated: “You shall neither lacerate yourselves, nor place a bald spot between your eyes for the dead” | Makkot 20a:12 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states: </b> From the verse concerning priests: <b>“They shall not create</b> a bald spot upon their heads” (Leviticus 21:5), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>he created four or five bald spots</b> in one action, <b>he will be liable to</b> receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Bald spot, ”</b> in the singular, <b>to</b> render one <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every bald</b> spot. The verse continues: <b>“Upon their heads”; what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that term? <b>Since it is stated: “You shall neither lacerate yourselves, nor place a bald spot between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that one would be liable only for</b> placing a bald spot <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition <b>includes</b> placing a bald spot on <b>the entire head? The verse states: “Upon their heads, ” to include the entire head. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | “Bald spot” is stated here | Makkot 20a:14 | <b>“Bald spot” is stated here</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1) with regard to non-priests, <b>and “bald spot” is stated there, </b> with regard to priests; <b>just as there, </b> with regard to priests, one is <b>liable for each and every bald spot</b> that he creates, <b>and is liable for</b> a bald spot created anywhere on his <b>head as</b> he is for a bald spot created <b>between the eyes, so too here, </b> with regard to a non-priest, one is <b>liable for each and every bald spot</b> that he creates, <b>and is liable</b> for a bald spot created anywhere on his <b>head as</b> he is for a bald spot created <b>between the eyes. And just as there, </b> with regard to non-priests, the prohibition is stated with regard to creating a bald spot as an expression of mourning <b>over the dead; so too here, </b> with regard to priests, the prohibition is stated with regard to creating a bald spot as an expression of mourning <b>over the dead. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | for the dead” | Makkot 21a:1 | The Talmud answers: R' Yosei derives that <i>halakha</i> from a different source, as <b>R' Yosei holds</b> that <b>an incision</b> over the dead <b>and a laceration</b> over the dead <b>are one</b> transgression, <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to laceration: “You shall neither lacerate yourselves, nor place a bald spot between your eyes <b>for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), indicating that one is liable for cutting oneself in mourning only over a dead person. Therefore he can derive from the term “for the soul” that one is liable for each and every soul over whom he cut the incision. |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead” | Menachot 37b:5 | With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the tefillin of the head are donned on the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, </b> the Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As A baraita states: “Between your eyes”</b> (Exodus 13:9); <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head. Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, or is it only literally between your eyes? It is stated here: “Between your eyes, ” and it is stated there: </b> “You shall not cut yourselves, <b>nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), <b>Just as there, </b> the phrase “between your eyes” is referring to a place <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, </b> as that is <b>a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald</b> by removing his hair, <b>so too, </b> the place where tefillin are donned is <b>on</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of the head, a place where</b> one can <b>render</b> himself <b>bald. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | baldness | Shabbat 94b:8 | We learned in the Mishnah: <b>And the same</b> is true with regard to one who removes <b>his hair</b> with his hands; R' Eliezer deems him liable and the Rabbis deem him exempt. One of the rabbis <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who removes</b> enough of his hair <b>to fill the opening of the scissors</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable. And how much</b> is enough <b>to fill the opening of the scissors? Rav Yehuda said: Two</b> hairs. The Talmud asks: <b>But was it not taught</b> later in that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to the Torah prohibition against removing one’s hair and causing <b>baldness</b> as an expression of mourning the dead: “Nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead” (Deuteronomy 14:1), one who removes <b>two</b> hairs is <b>liable? </b> Apparently, enough to fill the opening of a scissors is a different amount of hairs. The Talmud answers: <b>Say</b> that these are not two different measures. The <i>baraita</i> is saying: <b>And the same</b> is true <b>for baldness, two</b> is the measure. |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | “You shall not cut yourselves [ titgodedu ]” | Yevamot 13b:17 | <b>Reish Lakish said to R' Yoḥanan: I</b> should <b>read here</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves [<i>titgodedu</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted as meaning: <b>Do not become numerous factions [<i>agudot</i>]. </b> In other words, the Jewish people should be united, rather than divided into disparate groups that act in different ways. Before analyzing this issue, the Talmud asks: <b>This</b> verse: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves, ” is required for the matter itself, as God is saying: Do not cut yourselves over the dead. </b> How is the <i>halakha</i> concerning factions derived from this apparently straightforward verse? |
| Deuteronomy 14:1 | read here: “You shall not cut yourselves” | Yevamot 14a:6 | <b>And</b> yet the question remains: According to <b>the one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>acted</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>we</b> should <b>read here: “You shall not cut yourselves”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Do not become numerous factions. Abaye said: When we say</b> that the prohibition: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”</b> applies, we are referring to a case <b>where two courts</b> are located <b>in one city, </b> and <b>these rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and those rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. However, </b> with regard to <b>two courts</b> located <b>in two</b> different <b>cities, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:3 | As it is stated: “You shall not eat anything abominable” | Avodah Zarah66a:10 | <b>And Rava</b> could <b>say to you: </b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>R' Meir, </b> who maintains that all forbidden foods combine, whether or not they have the same name or the same flavor, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says in the name of R' Meir: From where</b> is it derived <b>that any</b> foods <b>forbidden by the Torah</b> that fall into a mixture <b>combine with one another</b> to render a mixture forbidden? <b>As it is stated: “You shall not eat anything abominable”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:3), which indicates that <b>anything that I have made abominable, </b> i.e., forbidden, <b>to you, is prohibited for consumption, </b> and therefore all of these prohibitions are actually a single general prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 14:3 | “You shall not eat any abominable thing” | Chullin 114b:9 | § <b>Rav Ashi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited for consumption, </b> even though the verse explicitly prohibits only cooking? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> elsewhere: <b>“You shall not eat any abominable thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:3). This verse teaches that with regard to <b>any</b> practice <b>that I have made abominable, </b> i.e., forbidden, <b>to you, </b> the product <b>is prohibited for consumption. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:4 | and Rava says, | Bava Kamma77b:13 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment in the case of an animal of <b>diverse kinds. </b> The Talmud asks: It is <b>written</b> in the Torah: “If a man steals an ox or <b>a sheep [<i>seh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:37), <b>and Rava says, </b> concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this</b> verse <b>establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases: <b>Wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds. </b> The Hebrew word <i>seh</i> denotes either a sheep or a goat. A hybrid, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <i>seh</i>. Why, then, is the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable to one who stole this kind of animal? |
| Deuteronomy 14:4 | that Rava says | Bava Kamma78a:3 | The Talmud has established that when the Torah uses the word <i>seh</i> (Exodus 21:37) in the context of theft it does not serve to exclude animals of diverse kinds. The Talmud asks: <b>If so, </b> what is meant by <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rava says</b> with regard to the verse: “The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases, teaching that <b>wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Rava state this principle? <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>it is written explicitly with regard to them: “A bull or a sheep”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which, as taught in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>, serves to <b>exclude diverse kinds. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:4 | “The seh of sheep [ kevasim ], and the seh of goats [ izzim ]” | Bava Kamma78a:9 | <b>R' Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: Rava’s</b> principle <b>was stated with regard to a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that was born from a kosher</b> mother, <b>whose impregnation was from a non-kosher</b> animal. Rava is saying that this animal is not kosher. <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua, </b> although he would agree with this <i>halakha</i>, <b>he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 7a) <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“The <i>seh</i> of sheep [<i>kevasim</i>], and the <i>seh</i> of goats [<i>izzim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:4). The plural forms “<i>kevasim</i>” and “<i>izzim</i>” indicate that a lamb is not kosher <b>unless</b> both <b>its father is a sheep and its mother is a ewe, </b> and the same <i>halakha</i> applies to a kid. |
| Deuteronomy 14:4 | the sheep [ seh kesavim ], and goat [ veseh izzim ]” | Bekhorot 7a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>its conception</b> came <b>from a non-kosher</b> male animal it should be permitted. Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “These are the beasts which you may eat: “The ox, <b>the sheep [<i>seh kesavim</i>], and goat [<i>veseh izzim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:4). The plural form of “<i>kesavim</i>” and “<i>izzim</i>” indicates that a lamb is not kosher <b>unless its father is a male lamb and its mother is a female lamb. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehoshua. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:5 | that | Chullin 80a:19 | <b>As we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal. R' Yosei says: </b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal. As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> “aurochs” (Deuteronomy 14:5) <b>is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>Forest ox [<i>turbala</i>], </b> it can be understood that the wild ox <b>is a species of domesticated animal, and R' Yosei holds: From</b> the fact <b>that it is reckoned among the undomesticated animals, </b> it can be derived that <b>it is a species of undomesticated animal. But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> forest goats, which are not reckoned among the undomesticated animals, <b>all agree</b> that <b>they are a type of goat</b> and are fit to be sacrificed upon the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 14:6 | you may eat” | Chullin 100b:10 | The Talmud answers: <b>This statement, </b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve does not apply to a fetus, is <b>with regard to a kosher</b> species of animal, <b>because God stated</b> in the Torah: “And <b>every</b> animal that divides the hoof, and has the hoof wholly cloven in two, and chews the cud, <b>among the animals [<i>babehema</i>], </b> that <b>you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6). The term <i>babehema</i> may also be translated as: Inside the animals, indicating that anything inside a kosher animal when it is slaughtered is permitted for consumption, including all parts of a fetus. <b>But with regard to a non-kosher</b> species of animal the prohibition <b>applies. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:6 | Is that so? But when Avimi came from Bei Ḥozai he came and brought a baraita with him: | Chullin 68b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But when Avimi came from Bei Ḥozai he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with him: </b> One of the sources (see 69a) that the slaughter of a pregnant animal also serves to permit the consumption of the fetus is the verse: “And every animal that has a split hoof and is cloven into two hooves, chews the cud, of the animals, it you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:6). The verse mentions both “hoof” in the singular and “hooves” in the plural to teach that sometimes one may eat two hooves and sometimes only one, as follows: If the fetus extended two of its hooves outside the womb, if it <b>returned</b> one <b>hoof one may eat, </b> if it brought back both <b>hooves one may eat. What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that if it <b>brought back</b> one <b>hoof one may eat</b> that <b>hoof, </b> and likewise if it brought back both <b>hooves one may eat</b> both of them, in contradiction to Rav’s ruling? |
| Deuteronomy 14:6 | as it is written: “And every animal that has a split hoof | Chullin 69a:19 | § The Mishnah states: If, prior to slaughtering an animal, one <b>severed</b> pieces <b>from a fetus</b> that is in its womb, leaving those pieces in the womb, their consumption is permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And every animal that has a split hoof</b> and is cloven into two hooves, chews the cud, of the animals, it you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:6). The term “of the animals [<i>babehema</i>]” is translated literally as: In the animal, and is referring to the term “every animal” mentioned at the beginning of the verse. Accordingly, the verse may be read as saying: Every <b>animal in the animal</b> you may eat, and is referring to a fetus inside its mother. It therefore serves <b>to include the offspring, </b> i.e., the fetus, as being permitted by its mother’s slaughter, even if parts of the fetus had been severed. |
| Deuteronomy 14:6 | of the animals, it you may eat” | Chullin 77a:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the ruling that a placenta is permitted by virtue of the mother’s slaughter, the Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>As A baraita states: </b> “And <b>every</b> animal that parts the hoof, and has the hooves wholly cloven in two, and chews the cud, <b>of the animals, it you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6). The verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that a fetus is permitted by virtue of the mother’s slaughter (see 69a). The word “every” at the beginning of the verse serves <b>to include the placenta</b> as well as the fetus. One <b>might</b> have thought that a placenta is permitted <b>even if part of it emerged</b> from the womb before slaughter. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It</b> you may eat,” i.e., you may eat <b>it, </b> the slaughtered animal, <b>but not its placenta, </b> if it partially emerged. |
| Deuteronomy 14:6 | “And every beast that splits the hoof and has the hoof cloven in two, and chews the cud among the animals, that, you may eat” | Makkot 18b:4 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> based on the verse: <b>“And every beast that splits the hoof and has the hoof cloven in two, and chews the cud among the animals, that, you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6), from which a prohibition may be inferred: <b>“That, you may eat, ” but</b> there is <b>not</b> any <b>other animal</b> that <b>you may eat. </b> The Torah prohibits eating the flesh of any animal that lacks the indicators that it is a kosher animal. <b>And if</b> it is <b>as you say, </b> that an inference from a positive mitzva entails a prohibition, <b>why do I</b> need the following verse: <b>“This you may not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), as it was already inferred from the mitzva? Rather, apparently, the status of a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva is that of a positive mitzva, and one is not liable to receive lashes for its violation. |
| Deuteronomy 14:7 | “camel” | Bekhorot 6b:2 | <b>R' Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), teaching the term <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition of consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. According to R' Shimon, a non-kosher animal born to a kosher animal is forbidden for consumption, in contrast to the ruling in the Mishnah. |
| Deuteronomy 14:7 | “camel” | Bekhorot 7a:20 | § The Talmud returns to the dilemma of whether R' Shimon permits the consumption of the offspring of a kosher animal that resembles a non-kosher animal but has some of the characteristics of its mother. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), i.e., the term is written <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition against consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. <b>And if</b> in the latter case <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body <b>are similar to its mother, it is permitted for consumption. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:7 | the shesua | Chullin 63b:4 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> is the list <b>of</b> non-kosher <b>animals</b> in Leviticus <b>repeated? </b> It is <b>due to</b> the necessity of adding <b>the <i>shesua</i></b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), which was not listed in Leviticus. <b>And</b> the list <b>of</b> non-kosher <b>birds</b> is repeated <b>due to the <i>ra’a</i>. What, is it not</b> understood <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the extra list of <b>animals there, </b> in Deuteronomy, is <b>to add</b> animals, that the list of <b>birds</b> is <b>also</b> repeated <b>to add</b> birds? The Talmud responds: <b>No, there, </b> i.e., with regard to animals, the list is repeated <b>to add, </b> but <b>here, </b> with regard to birds, it is repeated only <b>to explain. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:7 | “This you may not eat” | Makkot 18b:4 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> based on the verse: <b>“And every beast that splits the hoof and has the hoof cloven in two, and chews the cud among the animals, that, you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6), from which a prohibition may be inferred: <b>“That, you may eat, ” but</b> there is <b>not</b> any <b>other animal</b> that <b>you may eat. </b> The Torah prohibits eating the flesh of any animal that lacks the indicators that it is a kosher animal. <b>And if</b> it is <b>as you say, </b> that an inference from a positive mitzva entails a prohibition, <b>why do I</b> need the following verse: <b>“This you may not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), as it was already inferred from the mitzva? Rather, apparently, the status of a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva is that of a positive mitzva, and one is not liable to receive lashes for its violation. |
| Deuteronomy 14:7 | of Rav Ḥanin bar Abba, as Rav Ḥanin bar Abba said: | Niddah 24a:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree? </b> The Talmud answers: They disagree <b>concerning</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanin bar Abba, as Rav Ḥanin bar Abba said: </b> The verse states: “Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only have the hoof cloven [<i>umimafrisei haparsa hashesua</i>]: The camel, and the hare, and the rock badger” (Deuteronomy 14:7). The apparently superfluous term <b><i>hashesua</i></b> is not a redundant description of the cloven hoof; it is referring to a separate <b>entity that has two backs and two spines</b> and therefore looks like an entirely cloven animal. |
| Deuteronomy 14:10 | four | Makkot 16b:8 | <b>Abaye says: </b> One who ate <b>a <i>putita</i>, </b> a creeping animal found in the sea, <b>is flogged</b> with <b>four</b> sets of lashes. There are two prohibitions stated with regard to creeping animals in the sea: “And any that do not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers…you shall not eat of their flesh” (Leviticus 11:10–11), and: “And any that do not have fins and scales you shall not eat” (Deuteronomy 14:10). In addition, there are two other prohibitions stated with regard to creeping animals in general: “You shall not render yourselves detestable with any creeping animal that creeps, neither shall you render yourselves impure with them” (Leviticus 11:43), for a total of four. |
| Deuteronomy 14:11 | “Every kosher bird [ tzippor ] | Chullin 140a:2 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage discussing kosher and non-kosher animals: <b>“Every kosher bird [<i>tzippor</i>]</b> you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:11). Since it was necessary for the verse to specify that it is referring to a kosher bird [<i>tzippor</i>], <b>by inference, </b> one may conclude <b>that there is a non-kosher</b> bird [<i>tzippor</i>], in contradiction to the statement of R' Yitzḥak. The Talmud rejects this: <b>No, </b> this is not the correct inference. Rather, <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that there is</b> a <i>tzippor</i> that is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption, despite its being a kosher bird. |
| Deuteronomy 14:11 | “Of all clean birds you may eat” | Kiddushin 57a:14 | With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, </b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches: The verse states: <b>“Of all clean birds you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:11). The superfluous word “all” is stated <b>to include</b> one of <b>the</b> metzora’s birds, which is <b>sent away</b> to freedom, while the words: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), are stated <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>the</b> other, <b>slaughtered</b> bird. |
| Deuteronomy 14:11 | “Of all clean birds you may eat” | Kiddushin 57a:8 | <b>R' Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Of all clean birds you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:11). The superfluous word “all” is stated <b>to include</b> one of the metzora’s birds, which is <b>sent away</b> to freedom, while the words: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), are stated <b>to include</b> in the prohibition the other, <b>slaughtered</b> bird. R' Yoḥanan asks: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the bird <b>is forbidden from</b> when it is <b>alive, is</b> a verse <b>necessary</b> to teach that it is forbidden <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter? </b> The Talmud answers: The verse is necessary, <b>lest you say: Just as it is in</b> the case <b>of sacrificial animals, where</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>them when</b> they are <b>alive, and</b> the act of <b>slaughter comes and renders them fit</b> to be eaten, so too with regard to the bird. The verse <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to the metzora’s bird this is not the case, and it remains forbidden even after it has been slaughtered. |
| Deuteronomy 14:12 | “But these are they of which you shall not eat” | Chullin 140a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> this kosher bird whose prohibition must be derived from this verse? <b>If</b> it is a bird <b>with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], </b> that would be superfluous, as that <b>is written explicitly</b> in the verse: “An unslaughtered animal carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat” (Leviticus 22:8). <b>And if</b> it is referring <b>to the slaughtered</b> bird from the purification ritual <b>of a metzora, </b> which is prohibited for consumption despite being kosher, that would also be superfluous, since it <b>is derived from the latter clause of the verse</b> in Deuteronomy, as the verse states: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), which serves <b>to include the slaughtered</b> bird <b>of the metzora. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:12 | “But these are they of which you shall not eat” | Kiddushin 57a:14 | With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, </b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches: The verse states: <b>“Of all clean birds you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:11).

| Deuteronomy 14:13 | writes in Deuteronomy: “And the ra’a , and the ayya , and the dayya after its kinds” | Chullin 63b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And now that</b> the <b><i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i> are one</b> species, <b>why did</b> the Torah need <b>to write</b> both <b><i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i></b> in Deuteronomy? The Talmud responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> Given that the two are one species, <b>I will read <i>ayya</i></b> and know that it is forbidden. <b>Why is <i>dayya</i> stated? </b> It is <b>so as not to give a claim to a litigant to disagree, </b> and <b>it should not occur</b> that <b>you call</b> it <b>an <i>ayya</i> and he calls</b> it <b>a <i>dayya</i></b> and eats it. Likewise, the Torah did not write only <i>dayya</i> so that it will not occur that <b>you call</b> it <b>a <i>dayya</i> and he calls</b> it <b>an <i>ayya</i></b> and eats it. <b>Therefore, </b> the Torah <b>writes in Deuteronomy: “And the <i>ra’a</i>, and the <i>ayya</i>, and the <i>dayya</i> after its kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:13). Consequently, both the list in Leviticus and that in Deuteronomy enumerate twenty-four birds, in accordance with the statement attributed to Rav. |
| Deuteronomy 14:19 | winged swarming things | Chullin 62b:4 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda says: These grasshoppers</b> found <b>among the shrubs</b> are kosher and <b>permitted</b> for consumption. <b>And</b> those found <b>among the cabbages are forbidden. Ravina said: And we flog</b> those who eat them <b>on their account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And all <b>winged swarming things</b> are impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:19). <b>And Rav Yehuda says: </b> The bird called <b><i>tzarda</i> is permitted</b> for consumption, <b>and</b> the <b><i>barda</i> is prohibited. And your mnemonic</b> to remember which is which is this: Eat any bird <b>except [<i>bar</i>] for it. </b> As for <b>the <i>marda</i>, it is uncertain</b> whether it is kosher. |
| Deuteronomy 14:19 | winged creeping creatures: | Makkot 16b:10 | If one ate <b>a wasp, he is flogged</b> with <b>six</b> sets of lashes. In addition to the five prohibitions violated by one who eats an ant, he is flogged with an additional set of lashes <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition with regard to <b>winged creeping creatures: </b> “And all winged creeping creatures are impure for you, they may not be eaten” (Deuteronomy 14:19). |
| Deuteronomy 14:19 | six | Pesachim 24b:1 | If one ate <b>a hornet, he is flogged</b> with <b>six</b> sets of lashes. Since a hornet creeps along the ground, all of the previously mentioned prohibitions with regard to an ant apply to it as well. An additional prohibition is stated in the following verse: “And all flying insects are impure to you; they shall not be eaten” (Deuteronomy 14:19). Based on this precedent, it is possible to say that the addition of the phrase “It shall not be eaten” with regard to impure meat indicates merely an additional negative mitzva for which one would be punished; however, it does not necessarily indicate a prohibition to derive benefit. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Anywhere that it is possible to expound</b> a new <i>halakha</i>, <b>we expound, and we do not establish</b> the verse as containing <b>additional negative</b> mitzvot with regard to that same prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 14:20 | He said to him: The Torah said: “Do not eat any neveila ” | Shabbat 108a:12 | <b>And this question was asked by a Boethusian to R' Yehoshua HaGarsi: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not write tefillin on the hide of a non-kosher animal? </b> He said to him, it is <b>as it is written: </b> “<b>So that God’s Torah will be in your mouth. ”</b> The Rabbis derived that one may write the passages only on <b>an item that is permitted</b> to be placed <b>in one’s mouth, </b> i.e., eaten. He said to him: <b>If</b> that is <b>so</b>, <b>on the skin of <i>neveilot</i> and <i>tereifot</i></b> coming from kosher animals, <b>one</b> should <b>not write</b> tefillin, as they may not be eaten. <b>He said to him: I will tell you a parable. To what is this similar? To two people who were sentenced to death by the king. One was killed</b> by the <b>king</b> himself, <b>and one was killed</b> by an <b>executioner [<i>ispaklitor</i>]. Which one is</b> more <b>praiseworthy? You</b> must <b>say: </b> The one <b>that</b> the <b>king</b> himself <b>killed. </b> Therefore, an animal that died at the hands of Heaven and not by a human action is superior. He said to him: If so, <b>then</b> the <i>neveilot</i> and <i>tereifot</i> <b>should be eaten, </b> as they were killed by the king. <b>He said to him: The Torah said: “Do not eat any <i>neveila</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:20) <b>and you say they should be eaten? </b> A Torah decree determines that they may not be eaten, but that does not mean they are inferior. The Boethusian <b>said to him: Well put [<i>kalos</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | “You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; | Avodah Zarah20a:5 | The Talmud notes: <b>And</b> this issue of <b>an undeserved gift</b> to a non-Jew <b>is itself</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; </b> for you are a sacred people to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is permitted <b>to a resident alien through giving and to a non-Jew through selling. From where</b> do I derive that it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal <b>to a resident alien through selling? The verse states: “You may give it</b>…<b>or you may sell it, ”</b> meaning that one has the option to do either of these. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | “You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien [ la’ger ] who is within your gates, | Avodah Zarah67b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what is the reasoning</b> of <b>R' Shimon? </b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that from the verse: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien [<i>la’ger</i>] who is within your gates, </b> that he may eat it” (Deuteronomy 14:21), it is derived that with regard to animal carcasses, <b>anything that is fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> to consume <b>is called an unslaughtered carcass</b> and is forbidden, |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, | Bava Kamma41a:22 | The Talmud continues: This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, </b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Accordingly, it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal carcass <b>to a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i>, i.e., a non-Jew who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot, <b>through giving</b> it to him as a gift, <b>and to</b> any other <b>non-Jew through selling</b> it to him. Apparently, without this explicit permission, it would be prohibited to derive any benefit from a carcass, due to the prohibition: “You shall not eat. ” Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” | Bekhorot 10a:2 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of R' Shimon: </b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is forbidden and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted, <b>as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to YHWH your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where the verse mentions being holy just as the other verse did, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it is permitted. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | to the ger | Bekhorot 23b:2 | The Talmud discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Bar Padda says: </b> An item with <b>severe</b> ritual <b>impurity</b> imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i>, <b>but</b> an item with <b>light impurity</b> imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog. And R' Yoḥanan says: </b> Both <b>this one and that one</b> impart impurity <b>until</b> they are no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>bar Padda? As it is written: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass; </b> you may give it <b>to the <i>ger</i></b> who is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Bar Padda understands from this verse that an item which is <b>fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> <b>is called an animal carcass, and that which is not fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> <b>is not called an animal carcass. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | is different, as the verse states: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” | Chullin 108b:2 | The Talmud answers: <b>Rav actually maintains</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>prohibited, and there, </b> the pot of milk mentioned above <b>is different, as the verse states: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). The verse teaches that <b>the Torah prohibits</b> only the <b>kid, </b> i.e., the meat, that was cooked in milk, <b>but not</b> the <b>milk</b> that was cooked in meat. The milk is not itself rendered non-kosher. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | it is stated: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass” | Chullin 113a:19 | <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says</b> that <b>it is stated: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and</b> in the same verse <b>it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk. ”</b> This indicates that meat of an animal <b>that</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> is <b>prohibited</b> for one <b>to cook in milk. </b> Consequently, with regard to meat of <b>birds, which</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass, </b> one <b>might</b> have thought that it <b>would be prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk, ” excluding a bird, which has no mother’s milk. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, | Chullin 114b:10 | <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>with regard to consumption; from where</b> do I derive that it is also prohibited <b>with regard to benefit? </b> It is derived <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of R' Abbahu, as R' Abbahu says</b> that <b>R' Elazar says: Wherever it is stated, “He shall not eat, ”</b> or <b>“you, ”</b> in the singular, <b>“shall not eat, ”</b> or <b>“you, ”</b> in the plural, <b>“shall not eat, ” both a prohibition</b> against <b>eating and a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> are indicated. This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, </b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Accordingly, one may provide such meat <b>to</b> a non-Jew <b>resident alien</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>by giving</b> it to him as a gift, <b>and to</b> any other <b>non-Jew by sale. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | it is stated here: “For you are a sacred [ kadosh ] people unto the Lord | Chullin 115b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where</b> does he derive that meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>for benefit? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>He derives it from here, </b> as <b>it is stated here: “For you are a sacred [<i>kadosh</i>] people unto YHWH</b> your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “Neither shall there be a sodomite [<i>kadesh</i>] of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). The similar expressions teach that <b>just as below, </b> the prohibition of sodomy is a prohibition that involves enjoyment, i.e., deriving <b>benefit, </b> not eating, <b>so too here, </b> meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | “You shall not eat of any animal carcass; | Chullin 115b:5 | <b>The school of R' Eliezer taught: </b> The verse states: <b>“You shall not eat of any animal carcass; </b> you may give it to the stranger who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a sacred people to YHWH your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>The Torah stated</b> the prohibition of meat cooked in milk after the <i>halakha</i> of an animal carcass to teach that <b>when you sell</b> a carcass to a non-Jew, <b>you shall not cook it</b> in milk <b>and</b> then <b>sell it, </b> i.e., meat cooked in milk is prohibited for benefit and may not be sold. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people | Chullin 115b:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto YHWH your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]; </b> you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as below it is prohibited</b> to eat a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>so too here it is prohibited</b> to eat meat cooked in milk. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated: “You shall not eat | Chullin 116a:11 | § The Mishnah further teaches that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated: “You shall not eat</b> of any animal carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21), and in the same verse it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk. ” This indicates that the meat of an animal that is subject to be prohibited due to the prohibition of eating an unslaughtered carcass is prohibited to cook in milk. Consequently, one might have thought it is prohibited to cook in milk the meat of a bird, which is subject to this prohibition. Therefore, the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,” to exclude a bird, which has no mother’s milk. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili, </b> who excludes a bird from the prohibition of meat and milk due to the phrase “in its mother’s milk,” <b>and</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, </b> who comes to the same conclusion as R' Yosei HaGelili based upon the phrase “You shall not cook a kid”? |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | as it is stated: “For you are a holy people | Chullin 116a:7 | The Talmud notes: <b>The Mishnah, </b> which states that meat cooked in milk is prohibited for benefit, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of R' Shimon: </b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> it is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as it is stated: “For you are a holy people</b> to YHWH your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). And the verse <b>states elsewhere: “And you shall be holy people to Me; </b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | from the fact that the Merciful One states that you shall not eat an unslaughtered animal carcass, | Chullin 37a:5 | The fact that its meat is permitted is derived <b>from the fact that God states that you shall not eat an unslaughtered animal carcass, </b> as it is written: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21); one learns <b>by inference</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted. As, if it enters your mind</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is prohibited, now</b> if an animal is <b>prohibited while alive, </b> is it <b>necessary</b> to state that it is prohibited <b>after death? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | a prohibition: | Chullin 37a:7 | The Talmud questions that understanding. <b>And perhaps, actually I will say to you: </b> The halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, but if one slaughters the animal in danger of imminent death <b>while alive, </b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive</b> mitzva: “These are the living beings that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:2), whereas <b>after</b> its <b>death, </b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition: </b> “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21). |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | is different there, | Chullin 71a:19 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different there, </b> as with regard to the prohibition against eating a carcass the Torah states: “You shall not eat any carcass; you may give it to the non-Jew resident who is in your cities” (Deuteronomy 14:21). The juxtaposition of the two parts of the verse teaches that the prohibition is limited to a carcass that is fit to be given to a non-Jew resident, i.e., it is fit for human consumption. Accordingly, perhaps the carcass that the person ate does not impart impurity, <b>as it is no</b> longer <b>fit for a non-Jew resident, </b> i.e., it is now unsuitable for human consumption. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | any [ kol ] animal carcass” | Keritot 21a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the prohibition against consuming the <b>blood of</b> a <i>koy</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its fat</b> is also forbidden? The Talmud answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] fat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). The additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the fat of a <i>koy</i> as being forbidden. The Talmud inquires further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>its carcass</b> is prohibited? The Talmud answers that this is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “You shall not eat <b>any [<i>kol</i>] animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). Here too, the additional word “<i>kol</i>” serves to include the carcass of a <i>koy</i> as being prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, | Kiddushin 56b:10 | The Talmud continues the question: <b>As R' Abbahu says</b> that <b>R' Elazar says</b> that <b>wherever it is stated: “It shall not be eaten”; </b> or <b>“you, ”</b> singular, <b>“shall not eat”; or “you, ”</b> plural, <b>“shall not eat”; both a prohibition</b> against <b>eating and a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> are indicated. This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, </b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” | Kiddushin 57b:10 | The Talmud comments: <b>The Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Yehuda says: </b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “For you are a holy people to YHWH your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it states there</b> with regard to the prohibition of an unslaughtered animal carcass: <b>“And you shall be holy men to Me”</b> (Exodus 22:30). Since both verses employ the term “holy” he derives: <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of an animal carcass, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as the Torah explicitly states that it may be sold to a non-Jew, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” | Menachot 101b:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of R' Shimon: </b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to YHWH your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, so too here, </b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where being a holy people is also mentioned, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | “You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; | Pesachim 21b:7 | <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; </b> for you are a sacred people to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is permitted <b>to a resident alien through giving and to a non-Jew through selling. From where</b> do I derive that it is permitted <b>to a resident alien through selling? The verse states: “You may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates…or you may sell it, ”</b> meaning that one has the option to do either of these. <b>From where is it derived</b> that it is permitted <b>to a non-Jew through giving</b> and one is not required to sell it to him? <b>The verse states: “You may give it</b>…<b>that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. ”</b> Therefore, <b>you may say</b> that he may transfer it to <b>both a resident alien and a non-Jew, both through giving and through selling. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Meir. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people | Pesachim 24b:11 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection. Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> that has been cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto YHWH your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated there: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; </b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]; you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to meat in milk, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | “You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; | Shabbat 130a:11 | <b>As we learned</b> in a Mishnah, <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; </b> to the stranger at your gates you may give it, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it is stated</b> later in the same verse: <b>“You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk. ”</b> From the juxtaposition of the two issues it is derived: <b>That which is prohibited due to</b> the prohibition against eating an <b>unslaughtered animal, it is prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk. </b> The prohibition against cooking a creature in milk is not limited to only a kid. If so, with regard to <b>poultry, which is prohibited due to</b> the prohibition against eating an <b>unslaughtered animal, </b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>it should be prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk; therefore, the verse states: “In its mother’s milk. ”</b> This <b>excludes poultry, which does not have mother’s milk</b> and is therefore not included in the prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 14:21 | they disagree. | Yoma 36b:1 | It is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against eating <b>an unslaughtered animal carcass, </b> and similar prohibitions, that <b>they disagree. </b> The Torah says: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered animal carcass; give it to the stranger in your community to eat” (Deuteronomy 14:21). The dispute is whether this is a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva or whether it is a standard prohibition punishable by lashes. |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | it is written: “You shall tithe a tithe” | Bekhorot 53b:16 | The Talmud suggests: <b>If so, </b> let us <b>also</b> say that <b>new</b> flocks are tithed together with <b>old</b> flocks, based on that amplification of the verse. The Talmud answers that <b>it is written: “You shall tithe a tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22), to teach that old and new flocks are not tithed together. The Talmud asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to use the juxtaposition to prohibit tithing old and new flocks together but not to prohibit tithing sheep and goats together? <b>Rava said the verse states: “Year by year”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22), which teaches that <b>I have juxtaposed</b> the flocks <b>with regard to the year</b> in which they were born, i.e., to prohibit tithing old and new flocks together, <b>but not with regard to another matter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | “Year | Bekhorot 54b:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it <b>Rava</b> himself <b>who said</b> that the term: <b>“Year</b> by year” (Deuteronomy 14:22), teaches that <b>I have juxtaposed</b> the two types of tithe <b>with regard to the year</b> in which they were born, teaching that one may not tithe old and new flocks together, <b>but not with regard to another matter, </b> i.e., there is no prohibition against tithing two types together? The Talmud answers: <b>Rava retracted that</b> first opinion, and maintains that the juxtaposition applies even to the tithing of two types together. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>one of</b> those opinions was <b>said</b> by <b>Rav Pappa, </b> not by Rava. Since Rav Pappa was Rava’s closest student and took over as head of the academy after Rava’s death, his statements were occasionally mistaken for those of Rava himself. |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | is different with regard to tithe, as the verse states: “You shall tithe | Nedarim 59b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And anywhere that one exerts</b> himself, <b>is</b> the original part <b>nullified by the majority? </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> isn’t there the case of one who sowed <b>a <i>litra</i> of untithed tithe, </b> where <b>he exerts</b> himself to sow it, <b>and it is taught: And that</b> original <b><i>litra</i></b> of untithed first tithe that he sowed, one <b>proportionally tithes for it from</b> produce in <b>a different place, </b> and its prohibition is not neutralized by the growth. The Talmud answers: It <b>is different with regard to tithe, as the verse states: “You shall tithe</b> all the produce of your seed that is brought forth in the field” (Deuteronomy 14:22), indicating that all permitted seeds that are sown must be tithed, since <b>permitted</b> seeds that were tithed, <b>people</b> typically <b>sow. Forbidden</b> seeds that were not tithed, <b>people do not</b> typically <b>sow, </b> but the rabbis penalized one who sowed untithed seeds and required him to tithe that which he was originally obligated to tithe and decreed that it is not neutralized by the majority. |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | said to him: Because they tithe, as it is stated: “A tithe you shall tithe [ asser te’asser ] | Shabbat 119a:6 | <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>raised a dilemma before R' Yishmael ben Yosei: </b> With regard to <b>the wealthy of Eretz Yisrael, by what</b> virtue <b>do they merit</b> their wealth? He <b>said to him: Because they tithe, as it is stated: “A tithe you shall tithe [<i>asser te’asser</i>]</b> from all the crops of your seed that come out of the field each year” (Deuteronomy 14:22). The rabbis interpreted this homiletically: <b>Take a tithe [<i>asser</i>] so that you will become wealthy [<i>titasher</i>]. </b> He asked: With regard to <b>the wealthy of Babylonia, </b> who are not obligated to tithe, <b>by what</b> virtue <b>do they merit</b> their wealth? He <b>said to him: Because they honor the Torah</b> and the rabbis in Babylonia. |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | as it is written: “You shall surely tithe all the produce of your planting, | Sukkah 36a:10 | <b>Alternatively, R' Shimon stated his opinion only there</b> with regard to the exemption of an unripe <i>etrog</i> from tithes, <b>as it is written: “You shall surely tithe all the produce of your planting, </b> which is brought forth in the field year by year” (Deuteronomy 14:22). From that verse it is derived that the obligation to tithe applies only to produce that has developed to the point where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field <b>for sowing; </b> one is not obligated to tithe unripe fruit that is not suitable for planting. <b>However, </b> perhaps <b>here he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, </b> who disagree with R' Akiva and would deem an unripe <i>etrog</i> fit. |
| Deuteronomy 14:22 | “A tithe shall you tithe [ te’aser ]” | Taanit 9a:1 | <b>“A tithe shall you tithe [<i>te’aser</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22)? This phrase can be interpreted homiletically: <b>Take a tithe [<i>asser</i>] so that you will become wealthy [<i>titasher</i>], </b> in the merit of the mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil” | Keritot 4b:30 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>Since God writes: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), from which it is derived that <b>inside</b> the chosen place, Jerusalem, <b>yes, </b> one may eat second tithe, but <b>outside</b> Jerusalem, <b>no, </b> one may not eat second tithe; <b>why do I</b> need <b>God to write: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17)? This verse serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions concerning tithes, to teach that one is separately liable to receive lashes for consuming each type of produce. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God… | Makkot 19a:5 | R' Yishmael concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God…</b>the tithe of your grain…and the firstborn of your herd and your flock” (Deuteronomy 14:23); the Torah <b>juxtaposes</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce <b>to</b> the <b>firstborn. Just as</b> the <b>firstborn</b> may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple, so too, </b> second<b>-tithe</b> produce may be eaten there <b>only in the presence of the Temple. </b> The Talmud explains: the proof of Rav Sheshet’s opinion from the <i>baraita</i> is: <b>And if it is so</b> that the lack of recitation of the Torah verses invalidates the ritual of first fruits, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>refute</b> the derivation by saying: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about first fruits? </b> They are notable <b>in that they require recitation</b> of the Torah verses <b>and placement</b> alongside the altar. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks” | Rosh Hashanah5b:14 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), thereby <b>juxtaposing a firstborn</b> animal <b>to the tithe</b> of grain. <b>Just as tithe is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next, </b> as it is explicitly stated that tithes may be eaten until the end of three years, <b>so too, a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next, </b> despite the delay in being brought to the altar. Therefore, there is another source for the <i>halakha</i> that the offering itself does not become disqualified even if it is brought late. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | is stated: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your tirosh , | Shevuot 22b:17 | The Talmud explains: <b>If you wish, </b> you may <b>propose a logical argument</b> for this ruling: It is clear that drinking is included in eating from the fact <b>that a person will say to another: Let’s</b> have <b>a taste</b> of <b>something, and they go in and eat and drink. And if you wish, cite a verse</b> as the source for this ruling, <b>as Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that drinking is included in eating? It is</b> derived <b>from that</b> which <b>is stated: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your <i>tirosh</i>, </b> and of your oil” (Deuteronomy 14:23). |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep” | Temurah 21a:17 | <b>The verse states</b> with regard to second tithe: <b>“And you shall eat before YHWH your God</b> in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). This verse <b>compares</b> second <b>tithe to the firstborn: Just as a firstborn is eaten only in the presence of the Temple, so too, </b> second <b>tithe is eaten only in the presence of the Temple. </b> This concludes the statement of R' Yishmael. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” | Temurah 21b:3 | § The Talmud cites the second statement of R' Yosei from the elders, in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> above: <b>R' Akiva says: </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may bring up a firstborn from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>when the Temple is standing and sacrifice it. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). R' Akiva derives from here that only <b>from the place that you bring up the tithe of grain</b> to Jerusalem, i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <b>may you bring up a firstborn</b> to the Temple as an offering. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | in order that you should learn to fear the Lord your God all the days” | Yevamot 93a:9 | R' Ḥiyya <b>said to him: You acted well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that discusses tithes: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God…<b>in order that you should learn to fear YHWH your God all the days”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). With regard to the emphasis of “all,” <b>these are <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was this stated? <b>If we say</b> it was stated in regard to the issue <b>of tithing and eating</b> on Shabbat, this <i>halakha</i> is redundant. <b>Was a verse necessary to permit</b> the prohibition against <b>moving</b> objects, which applies <b>by rabbinic</b> law? Since the prohibition against moving objects is from the rabbis, the Torah is certainly not referring to this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | your oil” | Yoma 76a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>Are these five</b> the only afflictions? <b>We learn</b> in the Mishnah that there are <b>six: </b> Eating, drinking, bathing, smearing oil, sex, and wearing shoes. The Talmud answers: <b>Drinking is included in</b> the prohibition of <b>eating; </b> both together are considered a single affliction. <b>As Reish Lakish said: From where do we derive that drinking is included in</b> the concept of <b>eating? As it is stated: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, </b> of <b>your wine [<i>tirosh</i>], and</b> of <b>your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). <b><i>Tirosh</i> is wine, </b> yet the verse <b>calls</b> the drinking of wine eating with the phrase <b>“and you shall eat, ”</b> meaning that eating also refers to drinking. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | the tithe of your grain, | Zevachim 29b:2 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, </b> in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, <b>the tithe of your grain, </b> of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks” (Deuteronomy 14:23). The verse <b>juxtaposes a firstborn</b> animal <b>to</b> the <b>tithe</b> of grain to indicate that <b>just as</b> the <b>tithe is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from</b> one <b>year to the next</b> (see Deuteronomy 14:28), <b>so too a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from</b> one <b>year to the next. </b> If so, one already derives from this verse that an offering is not disqualified even if it is brought late. |
| Deuteronomy 14:23 | there” | Zevachim 50a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the money to purchase <b>peace offerings themselves</b> can come from money used to redeem the second tithe? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to peace offerings: “And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and shall eat <b>there”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). And it is written with regard to second tithe: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell <b>there”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). The usage of the term “there” in both passages serves as a verbal analogy, and demonstrates that a <i>halakha</i> derived via a verbal analogy, that of a peace offering, can then teach a <i>halakha</i> via its juxtaposition to a thanks offering. |
| Deuteronomy 14:24 | “As the place is too far from you [ mimmekha ]” | Makkot 19b:13 | <b>A certain elder taught them</b> <i>a baraita</i> <b>of the school of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai. </b> It is written: <b>“As the place is too far from you [<i>mimmekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:24); and the term “<i>mimmekha</i>” is interpreted as: <b>From your fullness [<i>mimmilluakha</i>], </b> indicating the person and all his appurtenances, including the burden he bears. If any part of him or his appurtenances is inside the city, it is as though he is entirely inside the city, and therefore he may not redeem the second-tithe produce. |
| Deuteronomy 14:24 | so that you are not able to carry it [ se’eto ], | Pesachim 36b:4 | The Talmud explains: <b>As R' Eliezer said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to second-tithe</b> produce <b>that became ritually impure, that one</b> may <b>redeem it even in Jerusalem? </b> Second-tithe produce that has been redeemed may be removed from the city. <b>The verse states: </b> “And if the way is too long for you, <b>so that you are not able to carry it [<i>se’eto</i>], </b> because the place is too far from you, which YHWH your God shall choose to set His name there, when YHWH your God shall bless you” (Deuteronomy 14:24). |
| Deuteronomy 14:24 | tithe, | Pesachim 94b:10 | <b>Rava said: It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> as to R' Eliezer’s true opinion, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> The exemption of <b>a distant journey is stated with regard to the Paschal lamb, and</b> the exemption of <b>a distant journey is stated with regard to</b> the second <b>tithe, </b> as the verse states: “And if the way be too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it because the place is too far from you, which YHWH your God shall choose to set His name there” (Deuteronomy 14:24). <b>Just as later</b> in the Torah, with regard to the second tithe, the exemption applies only to someone located <b>outside</b> the area <b>where it</b> may <b>be eaten, </b> as the second tithe may be eaten only in Jerusalem, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the exemption of a distant journey applies only to one located <b>outside</b> the place in which <b>it</b> may <b>be eaten, </b> which is the entire city of Jerusalem. According to this opinion, anyone located in Jerusalem is included in the obligation to offer the Paschal lamb. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | and bind up the money in your hand, | Bava Kamma98a:4 | <b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:6): One <b>cannot desacralize</b> second tithe by transferring its sanctity <b>onto money that is not in his possession. How so? </b> If <b>he had money in a fortress [<i>kastera</i>], or in the King’s Mountain [<i>Har HaMelekh</i>], or if his purse fell into the Great Sea, </b> one <b>may not desacralize</b> second tithe by transferring its sanctity onto that money. This indicates that money that fell into the Great Sea is considered lost. <b>Rabba said: </b> This is not difficult; it <b>is different with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, since it is necessary</b> that the money be <b>found in the hand</b> of the one who wishes to desacralize the tithe, <b>as God states</b> in the Torah: “Then you shall turn it into money, <b>and bind up the money in your hand, </b> and shall go to the place that YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 14:25), <b>and</b> if it is in the Great Sea, <b>it is not</b> in his hand, but nevertheless it is not considered lost. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The verse states: “And you shall bind up the money in your hand” | Bava Metzia42a:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Granted, </b> for <b>all</b> the other cases, the bailee is liable to pay, <b>as he did not safeguard</b> the money <b>in the manner</b> that <b>bailees</b> safeguard items. <b>But</b> if the bailee <b>bound it</b> in a cloth <b>and slung it behind him, what</b> more <b>was he to do? Rava says</b> that <b>R' Yitzḥak said: The verse states: “And you shall bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), from which it is derived: <b>Although it is bound, </b> in order to safeguard the money, <b>it</b> must <b>be in your hand. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | dinars, as Beit Shammai hold | Bava Metzia45a:6 | § There is <b>another version</b> of this discussion, and <b>some say</b> that this is the dispute between <b>R' Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. One said: </b> The <b>dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is <b>with regard to</b> exchanging silver <b><i>sela</i> coins for</b> gold <b>dinars, as Beit Shammai hold</b> that when the verse states: “And you shall bestow the money and you shall bind the money in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:25), the term <b>“the money”</b> is referring to the <b>first money, </b> i.e., the very money with which the second-tithe produce was desacralized, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> referring to the <b>second money, </b> e.g., gold coins that became second-tithe money by virtue of their being exchanged with second-tithe silver <i>sela</i> coins. Evidently, the money with which the second-tithe produce was desacralized must be taken to Jerusalem and it may not be exchanged for other coins. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | “And you shall bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Bava Metzia47b:5 | <b>Rather, R' Yoḥanan said: What</b> is <b>an <i>asimon</i>? </b> It is <b>a blank, </b> i.e., a piece of metal in the shape of a coin that was not yet imprinted. The Talmud comments: <b>And R' Yoḥanan follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as R' Yoḥanan said: R' Dosa and R' Yishmael said the same thing. R' Dosa, as we stated, </b> said that the legal status of an <i>asimon</i> is that of a coin. With regard to <b>R' Yishmael, what is</b> his statement? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). This serves <b>to include any type</b> of money <b>that is bound [<i>hanitzrar</i>] in</b> one’s <b>hand, </b> i.e., that has monetary value; this is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. R' Akiva says: </b> It serves <b>to include any type</b> of money <b>that has an imprint [<i>tzura</i>]. </b> R' Akiva requires a minted coin in order to desacralize a second-tithe produce coin, while R' Yishmael says that a blank can be used as well. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | cannot be desacralized with an unminted coin, as the Merciful One states: “And you shall bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Bava Metzia54a:17 | Second-<b>tithe</b> produce <b>cannot be desacralized with an unminted coin, as God states: “And you shall bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the rabbis interpret as serving <b>to include any item that has the imprint [<i>tzura</i>]</b> of a coin <b>upon it</b> for desacralization, not an unminted coin. The question is with regard to payment of <b>its</b> additional <b>one-5th: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of the possibility <b>that it will be desacralized with an unminted coin? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand” | Bekhorot 50b:5 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But there is</b> the case of the redemption of second <b>tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>one who exchanges</b> copper coins <b>of second-tithe money</b> for <b>a <i>sela</i>, </b> Beit Shammai say: He may exchange the copper coins for the entire silver <i>sela</i>. This Mishnah indicates that second-tithe money, mentioned in the Torah, can be in the form of copper coins, and is not required to be in the form of silver coins. The Talmud explains that the verse states: <b>“Money, ” “money, ”</b> using the term more than once. This <b>serves as an amplification. </b> In other words, this addition teaches that second-tithe money can be in any coinage, including copper coins. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | as it is written: “And bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Bekhorot 51a:6 | Second <b>tithe</b> may not be redeemed with items of equivalent value, <b>as it is written: “And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the rabbis interpreted as referring to money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>] engraved on it, i.e., a coin. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the</b> money for <b>appearance, </b> this is as <b>Rav Yosef teaches, that one may not bring</b> a lump of silver full of <b>base</b> metals <b>to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | And the Torah says: “And bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Berakhot 47b:10 | We also learned in the Mishnah that if one ate <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated food that had not been redeemed, he may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Talmud remarks: <b>It is obvious? </b> Why was it necessary for the Mishnah to teach this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud responds: <b>It was only necessary</b> for the Mishnah to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed, but not redeemed properly, i.e., second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>], </b> a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And the Torah says: “And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), which the rabbis interpreted as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> refers to <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it. Consecrated property; </b> in a case <b>where he redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money, and the Torah states: “He will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | And bind up [ vetzarta ] the money | Eruvin 31b:12 | The Talmud answers: This ruling <b>is only needed</b> for a case <b>where he redeemed them, </b> but <b>did not redeem them properly, </b> e.g., in the case of <b>second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>]. And the Torah says</b> with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: <b>And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money</b> in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:25). This is expounded to mean that the second tithe may only be redeemed with <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it; </b> however, unminted coins are not considered money for the purpose of redeeming the second tithe. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand” | Kiddushin 11b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of the redemption of second <b>tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>one who exchanges</b> copper coins <b>of second-tithe money</b> for <b>a <i>sela</i>, </b> Beit Shammai say: He may exchange the copper coins for the entire silver <i>sela</i>. This Mishnah indicates that second-tithe money, mentioned in the Torah, can be in the form of copper coins, and it is not required to be in the form of silver coins. The Talmud explains that the verse does not say <b>money, </b> but <b>“the money. ”</b> The addition of the article <b>serves as an amplification. </b> In other words, this addition teaches that second-tithe money can be in any coinage, including copper coins. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | was redeemed with an unminted coin [ asimon ]. As the Merciful One says | Pesachim 35b:15 | The Talmud answers: <b>Actually, </b> this is speaking of a case <b>where they were redeemed, and what</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>They were not redeemed? </b> It means <b>that they were not redeemed properly, </b> e.g., <b>second-tithe</b> grain that <b>was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>]. As God says</b> with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: “And you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and go to the place which YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 14:25). The phrase <b>“and bind up [<i>ve’tzarta</i>] the money”</b> indicates that the produce must be exchanged for <b>an object that has a form [<i>tzura</i>], </b> not unminted metal. |
| Deuteronomy 14:25 | “And bind up [ vetzarta ] the money in your hand” | Shabbat 128a:3 | We learned in the Mishnah: <b>Nor</b> may one move <b>second tithe</b> and consecrated items that were not redeemed. The Talmud asks: This is <b>obvious. It was only necessary</b> for the Mishnah to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they were redeemed but not redeemed properly. </b> When the Mishnah lists the <b>second tithe, </b> it is referring to <b>that which was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>], </b> i.e., a silver bullion that had not been engraved. <b>And God, </b> in the Torah, <b>states</b> in the case of second tithe: <b>“And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). The rabbis interpreted this as follows: <i>Vetzarta</i> is <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it. </b> When the Mishnah lists <b>consecrated property, </b> it is referring to <b>that which was redeemed</b> by exchanging it <b>for land instead of money. And God, </b> in the Torah, <b>states</b> with regard to this: <b>He will give the money “and it will be assured to him”</b> (Leviticus 27:19). Money and not land may be used in redeeming consecrated property. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | “And you shall give the money for anything [ bekhol ] your soul desires” | Bava Kamma54b:20 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning second-tithe money brought to Jerusalem: The verse states: <b>“And you shall give the money for anything [<i>bekhol</i>] your soul desires”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), which is <b>a generalization, </b> followed by: <b>“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, ”</b> which is <b>a detail, </b> and concludes with: <b>“Or for anything [<i>uvkhol</i>] your soul asks of you, ”</b> where <b>it then generalized</b> again. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | kol is written | Bava Kamma63a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that</b> the Torah <b>wrote</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> it is an amplification? But isn’t it</b> so that <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, </b> the word <b><i>kol</i> is written</b> in the verse: “And you shall bestow the money for whatever [<i>bekhol</i>] your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you” (Deuteronomy 14:26)? <b>And</b> yet <b>we expound</b> that verse <b>as a generalization, and a detail, </b> and a generalization. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | “And you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires, for cattle or for sheep” | Bava Metzia45a:12 | <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Are you raising an objection from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of exchanging coins within <b>Jerusalem</b> in order to apply it to the <i>halakha</i> of exchanging coins outside of Jerusalem? The legal status of <b>Jerusalem is different</b> with regard to exchanging second-tithe coins, <b>as it is written with regard to</b> Jerusalem: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires, for cattle or for sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26). One may utilize the money in Jerusalem in any manner he chooses. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | tithe money, | Eruvin 26b:18 | The Mishnah continues with two similar principles: <b>All</b> types of food <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money, </b> which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food (Deuteronomy 14:26), <b>except for water and salt. </b> Similarly, <b>one who vows that nourishment</b> is prohibited to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water and salt, </b> as they are not considered sources of nourishment. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | “And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires” | Eruvin 27b:14 | <b>R' Yehuda ben Gadish and R' Eliezer expound</b> the verse based on the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions. </b> When the verse states: <b>“And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), <b>it has amplified. </b> When it then states: <b>“On oxen, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink, ” it has restricted</b> its discussion to certain specific items. When it concludes with the phrase: <b>“On whatever your soul requests, ” it has</b> once <b>again amplified. </b> According to this exegetical approach, we conclude that since <b>it amplified and restricted and</b> once again <b>amplified, it has amplified</b> the general category to include <b>everything. What has it amplified</b> the category to include? <b>It has amplified</b> the category to include <b>everything. And what has it restricted</b> from inclusion in the category? Only one thing: <b>According to R' Eliezer, it restricted brine</b> from inclusion because brine is not at all similar to the items listed in the verse; <b>according to R' Yehuda ben Gadish, it restricted water and salt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | Ben Bag Bag says | Eruvin 27b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if something may not be bought with second-tithe money, <b>is one permitted</b> to buy it <b>by including</b> it in the payment for something which may be bought with second-tithe money? The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, and so it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Bag Bag says</b> in exposition of the verse: “And you shall bestow that money on all that your heart desires, on oxen, on sheep, on wine, on strong drink, on whatever your soul requests” (Deuteronomy 14:26): <b>“On oxen” teaches that one may buy an ox</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its hide. </b> Although the hide cannot be eaten, it may be bought together with the ox, and it does not acquire the sanctity of the second tithe. <b>“On sheep” teaches that one may buy a sheep</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its fleece, </b> which is used for purposes other than eating. <b>“On wine” teaches that one may buy wine</b> and include in its price payment for <b>its jug. “On strong drink” teaches that</b> one is permitted to buy not only actual wine, but <b>one may buy</b> even <b>mead, </b> water in which grape seeds are soaked, <b>once it has fermented</b> and acquired the flavor of wine. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | as it is taught | Nazir 35b:3 | § The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it is so, </b> that in the methodology of generalizations and details, the generalizations are similar to the details? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva to bring money for the second tithe to Jerusalem: “And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires, on cattle, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink, and on whatever your soul requests” (Deuteronomy 14:26). |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | “And you shall bestow the money for whatsoever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine [ uvayyayin ], or for strong drink, | Shevuot 23a:3 | <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </b> Cite <b>from here, </b> a verse written with regard to money with which one has redeemed second tithe: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatsoever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine [<i>uvayyayin</i>], or for strong drink, </b> or for whatsoever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before YHWH your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). The Hebrew word <b><i>yayin</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is wine, and it is written: “And you shall eat. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | do not leave their houses on the Festival, as it is written: “You shall rejoice, you and your household” | Sukkah 27b:8 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> There was <b>an incident involving R' Elai, who went</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> eve <b>to greet his teacher R' Eliezer in Lod on</b> the first day of <b>the Festival. He said to him: Elai, you are not among</b> those who <b>stay</b> home <b>on the Festival</b> and therefore you have not fulfilled the mitzva of the Festival, <b>as R' Eliezer would say: I praise the lazy, who, </b> although they act no differently than they do the entire year, are praiseworthy because they <b>do not leave their houses on the Festival, as it is written: “You shall rejoice, you and your household”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26). The term “your household” is interpreted as referring to one’s wife. One who is not home cannot rejoice with his wife. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | without joy, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice, you and your household” | Yevamot 62b:13 | § Apropos the discussion with regard to the mitzva to have children, the Talmud cites statements about marriage in general. <b>R' Tanḥum said</b> that <b>R' Ḥanilai said: Any man who does not have a wife is</b> left <b>without joy, without blessing, without goodness. </b> He proceeds to quote verses to support each part of his statement. He is <b>without joy, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice, you and your household”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), which indicates that a man is in a joyful state only when he is with his household, i.e., his wife. He is <b>without blessing, as it is written: “To cause a blessing to rest in your house”</b> (Ezekiel 44:30), which indicates that blessing comes through one’s house, i.e., one’s wife. He is <b>without goodness, as it is written: “It is not good that man should be alone”</b> (Genesis 2:18), i.e., without a wife. |
| Deuteronomy 14:26 | “And you shall spend that money on all that your soul desires, on oxen, or on sheep, or on wine, or on strong drink [ sheikhar ] | Yoma 76a:14 | <b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From here</b> there is a proof as the verse states: <b>“And you shall spend that money on all that your soul desires, on oxen, or on sheep, or on wine, or on strong drink [<i>sheikhar</i>]</b> or whatever your soul desires, and you shall eat” (Deuteronomy 14:26). <b>Strong drink is a drink, but God calls</b> its consumption eating, in the phrase <b>“and you shall eat. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 14:28 | it is written: “And you shall leave it at your gates” | Nedarim 84b:6 | <b>There, </b> however, the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to poor man’s tithe that is distributed in the threshing floor. Since with regard to</b> such a tithe <b>it is written: “And you shall leave it at your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:28), the owner cannot designate it for a particular person, and any poor person who comes by may take it from him. As the owner lacks the benefit of discretion, one who vows not to benefit from people <b>is permitted to benefit</b> from this poor man’s tithe. |
| Deuteronomy 14:29 | shall come, | Rosh Hashanah12b:4 | The same <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing</b> all the tithes of your produce in the 3rd year, which is the year of the tithe. ” This is referring to <b>the year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so? </b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe, and second tithe is canceled. </b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that even first tithe is canceled</b> during the 3rd year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the Levite, </b> because he has no part or inheritance with you, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, <b>shall come, </b> and shall eat and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 14:29). <b>Whenever</b> the Levite <b>comes, give him; </b> every year you must give the Levite his tithe. This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:1 | at its end, as it is written: “At the end of every seven years you shall make a release” | Arakhin 28b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, </b> it is clear that the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year abrogates <b>at its end, as it is written: “At the end of every seven years you shall make a release”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:1). <b>But</b> does the <b>Jubilee</b> Year abrogate <b>at its</b> very <b>beginning? It</b> abrogates only ten days later, <b>on Yom Kippur, as it is written: “On Yom Kippur shall you make proclamation with the shofar throughout all your land</b>…and you shall return every man to his possession” (Leviticus 25:9–10). The Talmud explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yishmael ben Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says: It is from Rosh HaShana that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>takes effect. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | “He shall not exact | Bava Batra145b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> states that gifts of groomsmen <b>are collectible in court. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that they are considered <b>similar to a loan. </b> The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And they are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>interest. </b> The reason is <b>that</b> it was <b>not</b> with <b>that in mind</b> that he gave him a larger gift. Rather, he did so on account of his joy at his friend’s wedding. The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does not abrogate them. </b> The reason is <b>that one cannot read</b> the verse concerning the abrogation of debts during the occurrence of the Sabbatical Year: <b>“He shall not exact</b> it of his neighbor and his brother, because YHWH’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <b>with regard to</b> gifts of groomsmen. Since one cannot choose to exact the gifts until the time of one’s own wedding, they are not addressed by this verse. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | “He shall not exact | Gittin 30a:16 | The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: <b>And the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does not cancel</b> this loan. The Talmud explains: The reason <b>is that concerning this</b> loan, <b>one cannot read</b> the verse stated with regard to the cancellation of debts by the occurrence of the Sabbatical Year: <b>“He shall not exact</b> it of his neighbor and his brother; because YHWH’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2). Since in any event one cannot claim repayment of this type of loan, it is not addressed by the verse in question. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | “And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate” | Gittin 36a:14 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The verse states in the context of the cancellation of debts: <b>“And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2). <b>The verse speaks of two</b> types of <b>abrogation: One</b> is <b>the release of land and one</b> is the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts. Since the two are equated, one can learn the following: <b>At a time when you release land, </b> when the Jubilee Year is practiced, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts; <b>at a time when you do not release land, </b> such as the present time, when the Jubilee Year is no longer practiced, <b>you</b> also <b>do not abrogate monetary</b> debts. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | he may accept it from him, as it is stated: “And this is the manner [ devar ] of the abrogation” | Gittin 37b:1 | In the case of <b>one who repays a debt to his friend during the Sabbatical</b> Year, the creditor <b>must say to him: I abrogate</b> the debt, <b>but if</b> the debtor then <b>said to him: Nevertheless, </b> I want to repay you, <b>he may accept it from him, as it is stated: “And this is the manner [<i>devar</i>] of the abrogation”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2). From the fact that the verse employed a term, <i>devar</i>, that can also mean: This is the statement of the cancellation, the rabbis derived that the creditor must state that he cancels the debt, but he is allowed to accept the payment if the debtor insists on repaying. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | “And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate” | Kiddushin 38b:3 | The Talmud answers: <b>It is necessary</b> to mention the cancellation of debts <b>only for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The verse states in the context of the cancellation of debts: <b>“And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2). <b>The verse speaks of two</b> types of <b>abrogation: One</b> is <b>the release of land and one</b> is the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts. Since the two are juxtaposed, one can learn the following: <b>At a time when you release land, </b> when the Jubilee Year is practiced, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts; <b>at a time when you do not release land, </b> such as the present time, when the Jubilee Year is no longer practiced, <b>you</b> also <b>do not abrogate monetary</b> debts. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | the verse states: “Because the Lord’s abrogation has been proclaimed” | Kiddushin 38b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one can learn the following from this juxtaposition: <b>In a place</b> where <b>you release land, </b> i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts, <b>and in a place</b> where <b>you do not release land, you do not abrogate monetary</b> debts. If so, the abrogation of debts would apply only in Eretz Yisrael, despite the fact that this obligation is not related to the land. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Because YHWH’s abrogation has been proclaimed”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2), to indicate that this obligation applies <b>in any case, </b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. This is the novelty of the statement of R' Elazar ben Shimon. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | “He shall not exact it | Makkot 3b:1 | <b>And even though now, </b> during the Sabbatical Year, <b>we do not</b> yet <b>read concerning his</b> loan the prohibition: <b>“He shall not exact it</b> of his neighbor and his brother, because YHWH’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2), as the time for repayment has not yet arrived, <b>ultimately, </b> when the time for repayment arrives, he will <b>come to</b> a situation where the prohibition <b>“He shall not exact it”</b> applies. Therefore, like all other debts it is abrogated by the Sabbatical Year. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | will release | Moed Katan2b:17 | <b>Abaye said: </b> The Mishnah is referring <b>to the Sabbatical Year in the present time, </b> when its prohibitions are only by rabbinic decree, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> When the verse states: <b>“And this is the manner of the release, </b> every creditor <b>will release</b> that which he has lent to his neighbor” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <b>the verse speaks of two releases: One</b> is <b>the release of land, </b> that one must refrain from working the land, <b>and the other</b> is <b>the release of money, </b> that one must refrain from collecting debts. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | he may accept it due to that which is stated: “And this is the manner of the release [ devar hashemitta ], | Shabbat 148b:12 | <b>And if</b> the borrower <b>says to him: Nonetheless, </b> I want to repay you, <b>he may accept it due to that which is stated: “And this is the manner of the release [<i>devar hashemitta</i>], </b> every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor or brother because YHWH’s Sabbatical Year has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2). The manner of the release, <i>devar hashemitta</i>, can be rendered: The statement of release. The rabbis derived that, although the creditor must verbally release the debtor from obligation, if the debtor persists in his desire to repay the debt, the creditor may accept payment. If, however, the loan was made after the Sabbatical Year, as is the case in the latter clause of the Mishnah, the creditor need not verbally release the debtor from obligation. |
| Deuteronomy 15:2 | that the verse states: “And this is the matter [ devar ] of the release: | Shevuot 49a:2 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>The Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates</b> the obligation to take an oath about a debt, just like it abrogates a debt. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> It is derived from the fact <b>that the verse states: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the release: </b> Every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because YHWH’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2). Since the word <i>devar</i> also means statement, <b>this teaches that the Sabbatical Year releases, </b> i.e., abrogates, <b>even a statement, </b> i.e., an oath. |
| Deuteronomy 15:4 | there shall be no needy among you” | Bava Metzia30b:1 | <b>there shall be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4). This verse can be understood as a command, indicating that it is incumbent upon each individual to ensure that he will not become needy. Therefore, <b>your</b> assets <b>take precedence over</b> the assets <b>of any</b> other <b>person. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:4 | the verse states: “Only so that there shall be no needy among you” | Bava Metzia33a:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to precedence in the return of lost items, the Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the verse states: “Only so that there shall be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4). This verse can be understood as a command, indicating that it is incumbent upon each individual to ensure that he will not become needy. Therefore, <b>your</b> property <b>takes precedence</b> over the property <b>of any</b> other <b>person. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:4 | the verse states: “Only so that there shall be no needy among you” | Sanhedrin 64b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And do the Rabbis not interpret</b> the term <b>“among you”</b> as referring to oneself? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33a): If one finds <b>his lost item and his father’s lost item, </b> taking care of <b>his</b> own lost item <b>takes precedence. And we said</b> in discussion of that Mishnah: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that it is because <b>the verse states: “Only so that there shall be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4), meaning that one must avoid becoming needy. Therefore, if one lost an item, tending to <b>his</b> lost item <b>takes precedence over</b> tending to the lost item <b>of any</b> other <b>person. </b> Apparently, this interpretation of the verse is based on the understanding that the term “among you” is referring to oneself, i.e., one must take care of himself so that he will not become needy. |
| Deuteronomy 15:4 | “Although there should be no needy among you” | Taanit 21a:2 | § The Talmud relates another story that involves an unstable wall. <b>Ilfa and R' Yoḥanan studied Torah</b> together, and as a result <b>they became very hard-pressed</b> for money. <b>They said: Let us get up and go and engage in commerce, and we will fulfill, with regard to ourselves, </b> the verse: <b>“Although there should be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4), as we will no longer be complete paupers. <b>They went and sat under a dilapidated wall</b> and <b>were eating bread, </b> when <b>two ministering angels arrived. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:8 | you shall lend [ ha’avet ta’avitennu ] | Bava Metzia31b:11 | With regard to the mitzva of lending money to the poor it is written: “But you shall open your hand to him, and <b>you shall lend [<i>ha’avet ta’avitennu</i>]</b> him sufficient for his need that he is lacking” (Deuteronomy 15:8). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that in a case <b>where one does not have</b> resources <b>and does not want to be supported</b> with charity, <b>God states: Provide</b> for <b>him by means of a loan. </b> In a case where <b>he has</b> resources <b>and he does not want to support himself</b> with his resources, <b>from where</b> is the obligation to lend him money derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Ta’avitennu</i>, ”</b> to teach that you must grant him a loan <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:8 | The Sages taught | Ketubot 67b:10 | The Talmud cites a dispute related to the previous discussions. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the double expression in the Torah: “You shall open your hand to him [<i>ha’avet ta’avitenu</i>]” (Deuteronomy 15:8). <b>“<i>Ha’avet</i>”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who does not have</b> funds <b>and does not want to be supported</b> by charity. The policy is <b>that</b> the charities <b>provide him</b> funds <b>as a loan and go back and give</b> the funds <b>to him as a gift. “<i>Ta’avitenu</i>”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who has</b> means <b>and does not want to support</b> himself. The policy is <b>that</b> the charities <b>provide</b> money <b>as a gift, and then</b> they <b>go back and collect from</b> his estate <b>after</b> his <b>death. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:8 | sufficient for his deficiency in that which is deficient for him” | Ketubot 67b:2 | <b>A baraita states: </b> Concerning <b>an orphan</b> boy <b>who has come to marry, </b> the community tries its utmost to provide for all of his needs. The charities <b>rent a house for him, arrange for him a bed and all his utensils, and thereafter</b> they <b>marry him a wife, as it is stated: </b> “But you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him <b>sufficient for his deficiency in that which is deficient for him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:8). With regard to the phrase <b>“sufficient for his deficiency, ” this</b> is referring to <b>the house. “Which is deficient”; this</b> is referring to a <b>bed and table. “For him [<i>lo</i>]”; this</b> is referring to <b>a wife. And similarly</b> the verse <b>states: “I will make him [<i>lo</i>] a helpmate for him”</b> (Genesis 2:18), when God created a wife for Adam. |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | It is written here: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart… | Bava Batra10a:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Anyone who turns his eyes away from</b> one seeking <b>charity is</b> considered <b>as if he worships idols. </b> From where is this derived? <b>It is written here: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart…</b>and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>And it is written there: “Certain base men have gone out…</b>and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the base men sin with <b>idolatry, so too here, </b> the base thought is treated like <b>idolatry. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | and they violated that which is written in the Torah: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart, | Gittin 36a:11 | § The Mishnah taught that <b>Hillel</b> the Elder <b>instituted a document that prevents the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>]. We learned</b> in a Mishnah <b>there</b> (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:3): If one writes <b>a <i>prosbol</i>, </b> the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> debt. <b>This is one of the matters that Hillel the Elder instituted because he saw that</b> the people of <b>the nation were refraining from lending to one another</b> around the time of the Sabbatical Year, as they were concerned that the debtor would not repay the loan, <b>and they violated that which is written in the Torah: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart, </b> saying: The 7th year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>He arose and instituted</b> the <b><i>prosbol</i></b> so that it would also be possible to collect those debts in order to ensure that people would continue to give loans. |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | and he cry to the Lord against you, and it be sin in you” | Ketubot 68a:1 | <b>Silver, </b> i.e., white, <b>tablecloths [<i>telei</i>] or gold, </b> i.e., colored, <b>tablecloths? </b> Clearly, then, they are not entitled to charity. R' Ḥanina <b>said: This is what R' Elazar said: Come and let us appreciate the swindlers</b> who ask for charity that they do not need, <b>because were it not</b> for <b>them, </b> who command our attention and receive our charity, <b>we would be sinning every day</b> in failing to properly support the truly poor, <b>as it is stated: </b> “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart, saying: The 7th year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and you will not give him; <b>and he cry to YHWH against you, and it be sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:9). Because the swindlers take our money in the name of charity, we have an excuse of sorts for failing to fully meet the needs of the truly poor. |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | “Beware that there be not a base [ beliya’al ] thought in your heart… | Ketubot 68a:2 | <b>And R' Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught: R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who averts his eyes from the</b> obligation to give <b>charity, </b> it <b>is as if he engages in idol worship. </b> It is <b>written here</b> concerning charity: <b>“Beware that there be not a base [<i>beliya’al</i>] thought in your heart…</b>and you will not give him” (Deuteronomy 15:9), <b>and</b> it is <b>written there</b> concerning idolatry: <b>“Certain base [<i>beliya’al</i>] fellows</b> have <b>gone out”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>Just as there, </b> in the latter verse, the word “base [<i>beliya’al</i>]” is referring to <b>idol worship, so too here, </b> this expression indicates a sin on the scale of <b>idol worship. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | as it is written: “The seventh year, the Sabbatical Year, approaches” | Makkot 3b:14 | Rav Mattana <b>said to him</b> that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “The 7th year, the Sabbatical Year, approaches”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:9). The question arises: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “The 7th year…approaches, ” don’t I know that it is the Sabbatical Year? Rather, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “The Sabbatical Year”? </b> It is <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is another</b> period <b>that is like the Sabbatical</b> Year; <b>and which</b> period <b>is it? It is</b> the period in the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another</b> for <b>an unspecified</b> period, <b>who is not permitted to demand</b> repayment <b>from him less than thirty days</b> after the loan took place. During that period, as during the Sabbatical Year, one may not exact payment for his loan. In what sense can that period be characterized as a year? It is <b>as the Master said: Thirty days in a year are considered a year. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | with their money, as it is written: “And your eye is wicked against your poor brother | Sanhedrin 109a:10 | <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money; “and sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies. “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money, as it is written: “And your eye is wicked against your poor brother</b> and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>“And sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph and the wife of Potiphar: <b>“And sin against God”</b> (Genesis 39:9). <b>“Before YHWH”; this</b> is referring to <b>blessing, </b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>God. “Exceedingly [<i>meod</i> ]”</b> is referring to <b>bloodshed, as it is stated: “Moreover Manasseh shed very [<i>meod</i> ] much blood”</b> (II Kings 21:16). |
| Deuteronomy 15:9 | for it shall be reckoned to you as a sin” | Sanhedrin 109a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda says: “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies; “and sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money. “Wicked”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their bodies, as it is written</b> with regard to Joseph and the wife of Potiphar: <b>“And how can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God”</b> (Genesis 39:9). <b>“And sinners”</b> is referring to sins they committed <b>with their money, as it is written: </b> “And your eye is wicked against your poor brother, and you give him nothing…<b>for it shall be reckoned to you as a sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>“Before YHWH”; this</b> is referring to <b>blessing, </b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>God. “Exceedingly”</b> means <b>that they had intent and sinned</b> and did not sin unwittingly or driven by lust. |
| Deuteronomy 15:10 | for due to this thing [ biglal hadavar hazeh ] | Shabbat 151b:13 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Elazar HaKappar says: A person should always request</b> divine <b>mercy with regard to this condition</b> of poverty, <b>for if he does not come</b> to a state of poverty, <b>his son will, and if his son does not come</b> to such a state <b>his grandson will, as it is stated: </b> “You shall surely give him and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, <b>for due to this thing [<i>biglal hadavar hazeh</i>]</b> YHWH your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you put your hand toward” (Deuteronomy 15:10). With regard to this verse, the <b><i>tanna</i> from the school of R' Yishmael taught: </b> Due to [<i>biglal</i>] this thing means that <b>it is a wheel [<i>galgal</i>] that turns in the world, </b> upon which people continuously rise and fall. <b>Rav Yosef said: We hold</b> that <b>a Torah scholar will not become poor. </b> The Talmud challenges this statement: <b>But we see that they do become poor. </b> The Talmud answers: Even so, <b>if there is</b> a Torah scholar <b>who becomes poor, he will</b> still <b>never</b> have to <b>go around</b> asking for charity <b>at</b> people’s <b>doors. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:10 | “You shall give him” | Shevuot 25a:13 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>How so? </b> Examples are if one <b>said: </b> On my <b>oath I will give so-and-so</b> some item, <b>or: </b> On my oath <b>I will not give</b> it to him. <b>What</b> is the case of an oath in which he says: <b>I will give? If we say</b> that he takes an oath that he will give <b>charity to a poor person, </b> that is not an oath that takes effect, since <b>he is under oath from Mount Sinai</b> to give charity, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to a poor person: <b>“You shall give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:10). |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | You shall open [ patoaḥ tiftaḥ ] | Bava Metzia31b:7 | With regard to the mitzva of giving charity and granting loans, it is written: “For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command you, saying: <b>You shall open [<i>patoaḥ tiftaḥ</i>]</b> your hand to your poor and needy brother in your land” (Deuteronomy 15:11). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to give charity <b>to the poor</b> residents <b>of your city. From where</b> is the obligation to give charity <b>to the poor</b> residents <b>of another city</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Patoaḥ tiftaḥ</i>, ”</b> to teach that you must give charity to the poor <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | as it is stated: “For the poor shall not cease from the land” | Berakhot 34b:20 | <b>And</b> the Talmud notes that this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The only</b> difference <b>between this world and the days of the Messiah is</b> with regard to <b>servitude to</b> foreign <b>kingdoms alone. </b> While in the days of the Messiah, Israel will be independent and free from enslavement to foreign powers, the world order will remain otherwise unchanged, <b>as it is stated: “For the poor shall not cease from the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11), which indicates that the ways of the world are set and unchanging. |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | as it is stated: “For the poor will never cease from the land, | Shabbat 151b:12 | The Talmud comments that this explanation <b>disagrees with</b> the view of <b>Shmuel, for Shmuel said: There is no</b> difference <b>between this world and the days of Messiah except for subjugation</b> to foreign <b>kingdoms alone, </b> from which we will be released in the Messianic era, <b>as it is stated: “For the poor will never cease from the land, </b> therefore I command you, saying: You shall surely open your hand to your brother, to your poor and your needy in your land. ” (Deuteronomy 15:11). This indicates that the ways of the world, including the existence of wealthy and poor socioeconomic strata, will continue forever. |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | as it is written: “Because the poor will not cease from within the land” | Shabbat 63a:10 | <b>And</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The only difference between this world and the messianic era is subjugation of the exiles</b> to other kingdoms, from which the Jewish people will be released. However, in other respects, the world will remain as it is, <b>as it is written: “Because the poor will not cease from within the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11). Society will not change, and wars will continue to be waged. |
| Deuteronomy 15:11 | “For the poor shall never cease out of the land” | Taanit 21a:4 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said to Ilfa: I will return</b> home and <b>fulfill with regard to myself</b> the contrary verse: <b>“For the poor shall never cease out of the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11). <b>R' Yoḥanan returned</b> to the study hall, and <b>Ilfa did not return, </b> but went to engage in business instead. <b>By</b> the time <b>that Ilfa came</b> back from his business travels, <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> had been <b>appointed</b> head of the academy, and his financial situation had improved. |
| Deuteronomy 15:12 | and he shall serve you six years” | Kiddushin 14b:12 | <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Abaye: </b> That is not so; rather, <b>everyone derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker, ” and here, </b> in the dispute in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>they disagree about this</b> following <b>verse. What is the reasoning</b> of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that one who <b>sells himself is sold for six</b> years <b>and more than six</b> years? He maintains that with regard to one <b>sold by the court, God excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, <b>and he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). That teaches that only <b>this</b> type of slave serves for six years and no more, but the same does <b>not</b> apply to one who <b>sells himself. </b> If he so stipulates, he may serve for more than six years. |
| Deuteronomy 15:12 | verse states: “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman is sold to you, and he shall serve you six years” | Kiddushin 14b:5 | The Talmud asks: Although <b>we found</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Hebrew female slave, </b> one cannot extrapolate from there to this case, as it is possible that it applies only to a female. The reason for this is that <b>since</b> she is ordinarily <b>betrothed through money, </b> she can also be <b>acquired</b> as a female slave <b>through money. From where do we</b> derive that <b>a Hebrew slave</b> can likewise be acquired through money? The Talmud answers that the <b>verse states: “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman is sold to you, and he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). This verse <b>juxtaposes a Hebrew man to a Hebrew woman, </b> indicating that the modes through which they are acquired are the same. |
| Deuteronomy 15:12 | “And he shall serve you six years” | Kiddushin 17b:5 | <b>As A baraita states, </b> with regard to a verse that deals with a Hebrew slave: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). This indicates that he serves <b>you and not an heir, </b> i.e., if the master dies his slave does not serve one who inherits his estate. Do <b>you say: You and not an heir, or</b> perhaps <b>is it even: You and not a son? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>When it says: “Six years he shall labor”</b> (Exodus 21:2), which does not indicate any exclusion, the inclusion of <b>a son is</b> thereby <b>stated. How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the other verse: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”? </b> The expression “serve you” emphasizes that he serves only <b>you but</b> he does <b>not</b> serve <b>an heir</b> other than a son. |
| Deuteronomy 15:13 | “And when you send him” | Kiddushin 16b:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud explains that this is <b>as A baraita states: </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one grants a severance gift only to</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who is released after six</b> years. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that one grants a severance gift to one who <b>left in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> one freed <b>through the death of the master, and a Hebrew female slave</b> who leaves <b>through signs</b> indicating puberty? <b>The verse states: </b> “You shall not <b>send him, ”</b> and: <b>“And when you send him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:13). These phrases serve to expand the <i>halakha</i> of severance to include any Hebrew slave who is emancipated. |
| Deuteronomy 15:13 | the verse states: “And when you send him free from you” | Kiddushin 16b:20 | I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees and</b> one <b>who is released through the deduction of money. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And when you send him free from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:13), which is referring to <b>one who was sent from you</b> with your knowledge and consent. This <b>excludes</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees</b> from his master <b>and</b> one who <b>is released through the deduction of money, who are not sent away from you</b> with your permission. <b>R' Meir says: One does not grant a severance gift to</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees, as he is not sent away from you, </b> because he left on his own. <b>But</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave who <b>is released through the deduction of money, who is sent from you, </b> he is granted a severance gift, as this deduction payment requires the agreement of the master. |
| Deuteronomy 15:13 | “empty” | Kiddushin 17a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Meir? </b> The Talmud explains: <b>He derives</b> a verbal analogy from <b>“empty”</b> stated with regard to the severance gift: “You shall not send him away empty” (Deuteronomy 15:13), and <b>“empty”</b> stated <b>with regard to a firstborn: </b> “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem; and none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 34:20). <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of the firstborn, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>, so too here, </b> in the case of severance gifts, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | “You shall furnish [ ha’aneik ta’anik ] | Bava Metzia31b:9 | With regard to the release of a Hebrew slave it is written: <b>“You shall furnish [<i>ha’aneik ta’anik</i>]</b> him liberally from your flock, and from your threshing floor, and from your winepress; of that which YHWH your God has blessed you, you shall give unto him” (Deuteronomy 15:14). Based on the conclusion of the verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>when the house is blessed because of him, one furnishes</b> the slave with gifts. <b>From where</b> have I derived the obligation to furnish him with gifts even when <b>the house is not blessed because of him? The verse states: “<i>Ha’aneik ta’anik</i>, ”</b> to teach that one must furnish him with gifts <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | “You shall give a severance gift to him” | Kiddushin 15a:6 | The Talmud clarifies additional details with regard to this dispute: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that <b>one does not grant</b> a severance gift <b>to one who sells himself? With regard to one sold by the court, God excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“You shall give a severance gift to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). <b>“To him”</b> means to one who is sold by the court, <b>but not to one who sells himself. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | to him” | Kiddushin 16b:16 | <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said like this: </b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Sage <b>Tutai. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Tutai says: </b> The verse: “You shall grant severance <b>to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), indicates that it is given to a Hebrew slave <b>but not to his creditor. </b> Even if the slave owes money, this gift is not given to the creditor. |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | it is written: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you” | Kiddushin 17a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>R' Shimon says: </b> The master gives him <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>like the fifty</b> shekels <b>of valuations</b> for an adult male. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Shimon? He derived</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> and <b>“giving” from valuations</b> (Leviticus 27:23): <b>Just as there, </b> he pays <b>fifty, so too here, </b> he pays <b>fifty. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that as this verbal analogy is referring to valuations in general, he should pay <b>the smallest of the valuations, </b> which is merely three <i>sela</i>. The Talmud answers that <b>it is written: “Of that with which YHWH your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift. |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | to include every matter? The verse states: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you” | Kiddushin 17a:16 | The Talmud answers: <b>These</b> terms <b>are necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one grants severance gifts only</b> from <b>the flock, the threshing floor, and the winepress; from where</b> is it derived <b>to include every matter? The verse states: “Of that with which YHWH your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “flock, ” “threshing floor, ” and “winepress”? </b> This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a flock, a threshing floor, and a winepress are unique in that they are included in</b> the category of <b>blessing, </b> i.e., they grow and multiply, <b>so too all</b> items <b>that are included in</b> the category of <b>blessing</b> may be given as a severance gift. This <b>excludes money, </b> which does not increase on its own. This is <b>the statement of R' Shimon. R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> This <b>excludes mules, </b> which cannot reproduce. |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | of each and every type | Kiddushin 17a:5 | § <b>A baraita states: How much does one grant</b> a freed slave as <b>a severance gift? </b> It is <b>five <i>sela</i></b> in value <b>of each and every type</b> mentioned in this verse: “And you shall grant severance to him out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress” (Deuteronomy 15:14), <b>which is</b> a total of <b>fifteen <i>sela</i>. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Meir. R' Yehuda says: </b> He is given <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> in total, <b>like the thirty</b> shekels <b>of</b> the fine that is paid for <b>a slave</b> (see Exodus 21:32). <b>R' Shimon says: </b> The master gives him <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>like</b> the sum <b>of valuations, </b> in which fifty shekels is the largest designated amount for a man (see Leviticus 27:3). |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | the verse states: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you” | Kiddushin 17a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let us derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“empty”</b> and <b>“empty” from</b> the case of <b>the burnt-offering of appearance</b> in the Temple brought on the pilgrimage Festivals, with regard to which it is said: “And they shall not appear before YHWH empty” (Deuteronomy 16:16). The burnt-offering of appearance has no fixed value. The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “Of that with which YHWH your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift. |
| Deuteronomy 15:14 | of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you” | Kiddushin 17b:2 | <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: “And you shall grant severance to him out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress, <b>of that with which YHWH your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that if the <b>house is blessed due to him, </b> then the master <b>grants him a severance gift, </b> and if the <b>house is not blessed due to him, </b> he <b>does not grant him a severance gift. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall grant severance [<i>ha’anek ta’anik</i>], ”</b> with the doubled form of the verb used for emphasis, to indicate that you must grant him a severance gift <b>in any case. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of that with which</b> YHWH your God <b>has blessed you”? </b> This teaches that <b>all</b> that one <b>gives him</b> as a severance gift should be <b>in accordance with the blessing</b> one possesses. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | “Because he fares well with you” | Arakhin 29a:18 | <b>Rav Beivai said: What is the reason? </b> It is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between <b>“well”</b> and <b>“well. ”</b> It is <b>written here, </b> with regard to a Hebrew slave, who can be sold only when the Jubilee Year is observed: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). <b>And</b> it is <b>written there, </b> with regard to a <i>ger toshav</i>: <b>“Where it is well for him; you shall not wrong him”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:17). The Talmud’s objection is that it is evident from the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to dedicated fields apply only when the Jubilee Year is observed. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | you…because he fares well with you” | Arakhin 30b:2 | Abaye explained: Such a possibility should <b>not enter your mind, due to</b> the fact <b>that God was</b> explicitly <b>lenient with regard to</b> a slave. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a Hebrew slave: “And it shall be, if he says to you I will not leave <b>you…because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The term “with you” indicates that the slave must be <b>with you, </b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>with regard to food, </b> and <b>with you with regard to drink. </b> This means <b>that you should not be eating fine bread</b> while <b>he eats inferior bread [<i>kibbar</i>], </b> bread from coarse flour mixed with bran. Likewise, <b>you</b> should not <b>drink old wine</b> while <b>he drinks</b> inferior <b>new wine. You</b> should not <b>sleep on</b> bedding made from <b>soft sheets</b> while <b>he sleeps on the ground. From here</b> the rabbis <b>stated: One who acquires a Hebrew slave</b> is considered <b>like one who acquires a master for himself, </b> as he must ensure that the slave’s living conditions are equal to his own. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | “Because he fares well with you” | Bava Kamma87b:6 | The Talmud continues its challenge. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not feed you, </b> i.e., a master is not legally obligated to provide sustenance for his slave, <b>this matter applies</b> only <b>to a Canaanite slave, as</b> the master can <b>say to him: Work</b> for me <b>the entire day, and at night go around, </b> beg, <b>and eat. But</b> in the case of <b>a Hebrew slave, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), indicating that the Hebrew slave must be <b>“with you” in food</b> and <b>“with you” in drink, </b> i.e., the Hebrew slave is entitled to live with his master as an equal, the master may <b>not</b> compel the slave to serve him unless he feeds him. <b>All the more so</b> is it not the case with regard to <b>his daughter, </b> that she is not required to beg for her sustenance and should receive the compensation herself? |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | a Hebrew slave, as it is written with regard to him: “With you” | Ketubot 43a:11 | <b>However, </b> in the case of <b>a Hebrew slave, as it is written with regard to him: “With you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which indicates that he is entitled to live with his master as an equal, the master <b>may not</b> compel the slave to serve him unless he feeds him. <b>All the more so</b> concerning <b>his daughter, </b> it cannot be the case that this young woman has to work and give her wages to the brothers if they are not obligated to sustain her at the same time. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | with you” | Ketubot 58b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>If</b> it is discussing a woman <b>who is not sustained, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that he may not consecrate her earnings? <b>Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me</b> but <b>I will not sustain you, this applies</b> only to <b>a Canaanite slave, about whom it is not written: “With you. ” But</b> with regard to <b>a Hebrew slave about whom it is written: </b> “It is good for him <b>with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), this does <b>not</b> apply, and the master must sustain him just as he sustains the members of his own household. <b>And</b> this is true <b>all the more so</b> with regard to <b>his wife, </b> as there is a specific obligation of sustenance. Consequently, if he does not do so, he certainly has no right to her earnings. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | works both during the day and at night? But isn’t it already stated: “Because he fares well with you” | Kiddushin 15a:12 | The Talmud clarifies: <b>And can it enter your mind that a Hebrew slave</b> actually <b>works both during the day and at night? But isn’t it already stated: “Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which teaches that he must be <b>with you in food</b> and <b>with you in drink? </b> All of the slave’s needs must be fulfilled, and his living conditions must be equal to those of the master himself. If so, he cannot be forced to work under unreasonable conditions. <b>And R' Yitzḥak says</b> in explanation of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that his master may provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite female slave</b> against his will to produce children for the master. This is the service he performs at night. |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | “Because he fares well with you” | Kiddushin 20a:14 | Abaye answered: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to expound the verses stringently, as indicated <b>from</b> the fact <b>that God is lenient with regard to</b> a slave and is concerned about his well-being. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning a Hebrew slave: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which teaches that the slave should be <b>with you, </b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>in food, </b> meaning that his food must be of the same quality as yours, and <b>with you in drink. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | has a wife and children and his master does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you and your house” | Kiddushin 22a:7 | <b>A baraita states: </b> If the slave <b>has a wife and children and his master does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you and your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The word “house” is referring to a wife and children, and therefore if the master does not have a wife and children the verse cannot be fulfilled, and the slave is not pierced. Similarly, if <b>his master has a wife and children and he does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5). |
| Deuteronomy 15:16 | he loves his master but his master does not love him, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you” | Kiddushin 22a:8 | Furthermore, if <b>he loves his master but his master does not love him, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which indicates that it is good for both of them to be with each other. If <b>his master loves him but he does not love his master, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you. ”</b> If <b>he is ill and his master is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you, ”</b> which excludes a sick person. Similarly, if <b>his master is ill and he is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated “with you, ”</b> which equates the well-being of the pair. |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | awl | Bekhorot 37b:10 | The Talmud asks with regard to the statement of R' Yosei ben Yehuda: If the ear was pierced with a hole <b>like</b> the size of <b>a lentil, </b> then <b>yes, </b> it is considered a blemish, but if it was pierced with a hole <b>less than</b> the size <b>of a lentil, </b> then is it <b>not</b> considered a blemish? <b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides a description of the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an awl</b> can be used. <b>From where</b> do I know <b>to include the palm thorn [<i>hassol</i>], a thorn, a needle, and a gimlet, and a stylus</b> for writing on wax as valid tools for piercing his ear? |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | awl | Bekhorot 51a:15 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an awl</b> can be used; <b>from where</b> do I know <b>to include the thorn of a palm, and a thorn, a needle, and a gimlet, and a stylus</b> for writing on wax, as valid tools for piercing his ear? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take, ”</b> which indicates that <b>anything that can be taken by hand</b> is a valid tool. This is <b>the statement of R' Yosei ben Yehuda. R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> Not all these items can be used. Rather, since the verse specifies an <b>“awl, ”</b> only items similar to an awl can be used; <b>just as an awl is distinct</b> in that it is fashioned <b>of metal, so too, anything</b> fashioned <b>of metal</b> can be used. |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | “And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise” | Kiddushin 17b:10 | § The <i>baraita</i> taught that <b>a Hebrew female slave serves neither the brother nor the daughter. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>R' Padda said: As the verse states</b> with regard to a pierced Hebrew slave: <b>“And also to your female slave you shall do likewise”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew female slave <b>to a pierced</b> slave: <b>Just as a pierced</b> slave <b>serves neither the son nor the daughter, so too a Hebrew female slave serves neither the son nor the daughter. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And also to your female slave you shall do likewise, ” come</b> to teach <b>this</b> matter? The <i>tanna</i> <b>requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And also to your female slave you shall do likewise, ”</b> is a command <b>to grant</b> her <b>a severance gift. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | The verse states: “And you shall take | Kiddushin 21b:5 | <b>A baraita states: </b> From the term <b>“an awl” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a master can pierce the ear of a Hebrew slave <b>with an awl. From where</b> do I derive that <b>a sharp thorn [<i>sol</i>], a thorn [<i>sira</i>], a needle, an auger, and a stylus</b> used to engrave in wax may be used? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take</b> the awl” (Deuteronomy 15:17). This term “and you shall take” serves <b>to include any implement that can be taken in the</b> master’s <b>hand. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yosei ben Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | “Through his ear and into the door” | Kiddushin 21b:8 | The Talmud explains: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expounds</b> the verses by means of the hermeneutical principle of reading the verse as consisting of <b>generalizations and details. </b> Accordingly, he maintains that the term <b>“and you shall take”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that indicates piercing may be performed with any implement. <b>“An awl”</b> is <b>a detail, </b> and when the verse states: <b>“Through his ear and into the door”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17), <b>it then generalized</b> again. When the verse writes <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the explicit detail</b> mentions an awl, which is made <b>of metal, so too, any</b> utensil used for piercing must be made <b>of metal. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | through his ear and into the door” | Kiddushin 22b:2 | <b>Rather, I would say</b> that the master <b>should pierce his ear outside, </b> i.e., not at the door, <b>and he should place it</b> afterward <b>on the door, and</b> then <b>he should pierce opposite his ear on the door. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “And you shall take the awl and place it <b>through his ear and into the door”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17). <b>How so? He bores through</b> his ear <b>until he reaches the door. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:17 | awl | Shevuot 4b:11 | This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an awl</b> can be used; <b>from where</b> do I know <b>to include the thorn of a palm [<i>hasol</i>], and a thorn, a needle, and a gimlet, and a stylus</b> for writing on wax, as valid tools for piercing his ear? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take, ”</b> which indicates that <b>anything that can be taken by hand</b> is a valid tool.

| Deuteronomy 15:18 | “For double of the hire of a hired worker | Kiddushin 15a:11 | <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, derive that the slave must remain with this female slave against his will? <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“For double of the hire of a hired worker</b> he has served you” (Deuteronomy 15:18). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that this verse: <b>“For double of the hire of a hired worker he has served you, ”</b> indicates that <b>a hired worker works only during the day, </b> whereas <b>a Hebrew slave works both during the day and at night. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | you shall consecrate | Arakhin 29a:20 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>R' Yishmael says: One verse states: </b> “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock <b>you shall consecrate</b> to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>and one verse states: </b> “However, the firstborn among animals that is born first to YHWH, a man <b>shall not consecrate</b> it” (Leviticus 27:26). It is <b>impossible to say: “You shall consecrate, ” as it is already stated: </b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate. ”</b> It is likewise <b>impossible to say: </b> “A man <b>shall not consecrate, ” as it is already stated: “You shall consecrate. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | male | Bekhorot 19a:4 | With regard to the definition of a firstborn, <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> can be derived by means of the form of exegesis known as: <b>From a generalization that requires a detail, and from a detail that requires a generalization. How so? </b> The verse states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, that which opens any womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal, it is Mine” (Exodus 13:2). Had the verse written only the generalization: <b>“Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, ”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a female</b> animal <b>is included</b> in the category of a firstborn. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the detail: “Every firstborn <b>male</b>…you shall sanctify to YHWH” (Deuteronomy 15:19). |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam says: | Bekhorot 24b:5 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>R' Yosei ben HaMeshullam says: </b> Since it is prohibited by Torah law to shear a firstborn, as it states: “And you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock” (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>one who is slaughtering a firstborn, </b> and must clear hair or wool from the area of the neck in order to facilitate proper slaughter, <b>clears space</b> by uprooting the hair <b>with a cleaver [<i>bekofitz</i>] from here and from there, </b> on either side of the neck, although he thereby <b>plucks</b> out <b>the hair. </b> He may clear space in this manner <b>provided that he does not move</b> the plucked hair <b>from its place; </b> it must remain intermingled with the rest of the hair so it will appear that he did not shear the animal. <b>And likewise, one plucks the hair</b> to enable one of the rabbis <b>to examine the place of a blemish</b> and thereby determine whether it is permitted to slaughter the firstborn outside the Temple. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock” | Bekhorot 25a:9 | The Talmud answers: A red <b>heifer is different, as it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>shearing</b> a consecrated animal because it does not have wool, and that is why it is permitted to cut the tops of its hairs. The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a firstborn <b>ox</b> may not be used <b>for labor and</b> that a firstborn <b>sheep</b> may not be used <b>for shearing. From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply what is said about that</b> animal <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> animal <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states: “You shall do no work…and you shall not shear. ”</b> The term “and” indicates the two parts of the verse apply to both animals. Evidently, the act of shearing does apply to an ox, including a red heifer. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | a firstborn, | Bekhorot 33a:6 | <b>And the other</b> verse teaches that <b>just as a gazelle and a deer are exempt from</b> the first of their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn, </b> as the verse states: “All the firstling males that are born of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 15:19), referring specifically to domesticated animals but not undomesticated animals such as a gazelle and a deer; <b>so too, disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>are exempt from</b> the first of their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn</b> (see 14a). |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | two verses written: “Males” | Bekhorot 41b:8 | The Talmud responds: <b>Actually, </b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis, </b> who maintain that a hermaphrodite is not a male, but a distinct entity. <b>And</b> as for the difficulty that in the case of a firstborn they excluded a female, a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite from a single verse, that is not so. <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> there are also <b>two verses written: “Males”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), and: <b>“That is a male”</b> (Exodus 13:12). As in the case of a burnt offering, one of these serves to exclude a female, while the other serves to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | states: “Males” | Bekhorot 42a:11 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this question of whether a <i>tumtum</i> is a distinct entity or is definitely either a male or female <b>is the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. </b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Ilai says in the name of R' Yishmael: A hermaphrodite is a firstborn, and</b> it comes <b>with its blemish; and the Rabbis say: It is not imbued with sanctity. R' Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of R' Shimon: </b> The verse <b>states: “Males”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>and wherever it is stated: Male, ”</b> this serves <b>to exclude only a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite. </b> Since according to R' Shimon ben Yehuda it is necessary for a verse to exclude a <i>tumtum</i>, like a hermaphrodite, from the category of a male, evidently in his opinion a <i>tumtum</i> is not considered to be one whose status as a male is uncertain but a distinct entity. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox” | Bekhorot 9b:13 | The Talmud offers an additional basis for the dispute between R' Yehuda and R' Shimon: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>R' Yehuda and R' Shimon disagree with regard to</b> the following <b>verse, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against shearing and working a firstborn kosher animal that the Torah states: <b>“You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), <b>but you may perform labor with</b> a firstborn animal that is both <b>your own and</b> also <b>that of others, </b> i.e., an animal owned in partnership with a non-Jew. Although firstborn status applies to the Jew’s share in the animal and he must give the value of his share to a priest, nevertheless, it has no sanctity and deriving benefit from it is permitted. The verse continues: <b>“Nor shear the firstborn of your flock, ” but you may shear</b> a firstborn animal that is <b>yours and</b> that is also <b>that of others. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “And you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock” | Chullin 135a:9 | The Talmud challenges: <b>The reason</b> for the exemption of sacrificial animals <b>is that God writes “your flock, ”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>were that not</b> the case <b>I would say</b> that even with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals one is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool. But</b> this suggestion is impossible, since <b>they are not fit for shearing, as it is written</b> with regard to firstborn animals, which are consecrated: <b>“And you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | even though it is written: “All the firstborn that are born of your herd [ bivkarekha ] and of your flock [ tzonekha ] | Chullin 135b:13 | Similarly, with regard to the <b>firstborn</b> status of a male firstborn kosher animal, R' Ilai concedes that jointly owned animals are sanctified, <b>even though it is written: “All the firstborn that are born of your herd [<i>bivkarekha</i>] and of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>]</b> that are male you shall sanctify to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19). Once again it might have been inferred from the singular pronoun in the terms “your herd” and “your flock” that <b>your</b> firstborn, <b>yes, </b> are sanctified, but the firstborn <b>that is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> is <b>not</b> sanctified. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “your herd” and “your flock” | Chullin 135b:14 | Therefore, <b>God writes: </b> “And there you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, and your tithes, and the gift of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, <b>and the firstborn of your herd [<i>bekarkhem</i>] and of your flock [<i>tzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6). The pronouns in the terms “your herd” and “your flock” in this verse are in the plural, which indicates that firstborn animals owned in partnership are sanctified. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“your herd” and “your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), where the pronouns are in the singular? The Talmud again answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> animals owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a non-Jew, </b> which are not sanctified. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | firstborn | Chullin 136b:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>And there, </b> with regard to the animal tithe, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it does not apply to a <i>tereifa</i>? The Talmud answers <b>that it is written: “Whichever passes under the rod, ”</b> which <b>excludes a <i>tereifa</i>, which is not</b> able to <b>pass</b> under the rod due to its physical state. The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> R' Shimon <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> mentioned in this context and the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]” from</b> the mitzva to consecrate the male <b>firstborn</b> animal. In that context, the Torah states: “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>] you shall sanctify to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the consecration of the <b>firstborn even a <i>tereifa</i></b> is consecrated, <b>so too, </b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool</b> the obligation applies <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock” | Chullin 137a:4 | The Talmud objects: <b>But derive</b> instead a verbal analogy concerning <b>shearing</b> mentioned in this context <b>from shearing</b> mentioned in the case of the <b>firstborn</b> animal: Just as the prohibition against shearing the firstborn also applies to a firstborn ox, so too, the <i>halakhot</i> of the first sheared wool should also apply to oxen. It is prohibited to shear a firstborn ox, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). From a straightforward reading of the verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a firstborn <b>ox</b> may not be used <b>for labor and</b> that a firstborn of an animal from the <b>flock</b> may not be used <b>for shearing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | you shall sanctify” | Nazir 4b:11 | <b>And R' Ya’akov</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>Also</b> in the case of <b>a firstborn, one grants it</b> consecrated status <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The rabbis <b>of the house of our R', </b> i.e., R' Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when <b>a firstborn</b> male animal <b>is born in one’s herd, </b> there is <b>a mitzva for him to consecrate it, </b> although it is consecrated from the time it is born? <b>As it is stated: </b> “All firstborns <b>males</b> that are born to your herd and to your flock <b>you shall sanctify”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | a mitzva to consecrate it? As it is stated: “The males you shall consecrate” | Nedarim 13a:6 | <b>And the one who renders</b> it <b>forbidden</b> is of the opinion that one who says that a piece of meat shall be considered for him like the meat of a <b>firstborn also associates</b> the object of his vow with an item forbidden <b>by a vow, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said in the name of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if <b>one has a firstborn</b> animal <b>born in his home</b> it is still <b>a mitzva to consecrate it? As it is stated: “The males you shall consecrate”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). Although a firstborn animal is considered consecrated from birth, its owner is still commanded to declare it consecrated, and it is therefore considered an item forbidden by means of a vow. |
| Deuteronomy 15:19 | “Nor shear the firstborn of your flock” | Temurah 11b:15 | § According to R' Yehuda, if one consecrates a limb, the sanctity does not extend to the entire animal. A Sage <b>posed a dilemma to Rava: </b> If one <b>consecrated one limb, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to shearing</b> the wool of that limb? Rava replied: <b>You</b> can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Nor shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). This verse indicates that the prohibition against shearing applies only to an animal belonging entirely to you, <b>but you may shear</b> the wool <b>of</b> a firstborn that <b>belongs</b> both <b>to you and to others, </b> i.e., non-Jews. Here too, since the animal is jointly owned by the Temple and by the one who consecrated it, the prohibition against shearing should not apply at all. |
| Deuteronomy 15:20 | unblemished, as it is stated: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year” | Bekhorot 26b:9 | <b>The firstborn</b> animal <b>is eaten year by year, </b> i.e., within its first year, <b>whether</b> it is <b>blemished</b> or <b>whether</b> it is <b>unblemished, as it is stated: “You shall eat it before YHWH your God year by year”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:20). If <b>a blemish developed within its</b> first <b>year, </b> it is permitted for the owner <b>to maintain</b> the animal for the <b>entire twelve months. </b> If a blemish developed <b>after twelve months</b> have passed, it is permitted for the owner <b>to maintain</b> the animal for <b>only thirty days. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:20 | Rav says that the verse states: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God, year by year [ shana beshana ] | Bekhorot 27b:4 | It is derived from a verse, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says that the verse states: “You shall eat it before YHWH your God, year by year [<i>shana beshana</i>]</b> in the place that YHWH shall choose, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 15:20). The phrase “<i>shana beshana</i>,” which can also be translated as: A year in a year, indicates that the verse is referring to one year that enters another year. <b>Which</b> type of <b>year enters another</b> year? <b>You must say</b> that this is speaking of the <b>year of the firstborn</b> animal, which enters the following calendar year, since if the animal is born in the middle of the year, its first year includes part of the subsequent calendar year. |
| Deuteronomy 15:20 | as it is stated: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year | Bekhorot 28a:10 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>R' Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a firstborn</b> animal <b>that developed a blemish during its</b> first <b>year that one gives</b> the owner <b>thirty days after its year? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall eat it before YHWH your God year by year</b> in the place that YHWH shall choose, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 15:20). It is derived from here that it may be eaten for one year and for another year. <b>Which are</b> the <b>days that are considered</b> to be a significant part of <b>a year? You must say these are thirty days, </b> which in certain respects are considered a complete year. This indicates that such a firstborn may be eaten for up to thirty days beyond the first twelve months. |
| Deuteronomy 15:21 | it is written: “Lameness or blindness” | Bekhorot 39a:15 | § <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises a dilemma: </b> Is <b>there</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal, or is there no</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal? </b> The Talmud inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> issue did he raise this dilemma? <b>If</b> it was <b>with regard to</b> whether such a blemish renders permitted the slaughter of <b>a firstborn</b> outside the Temple, <b>it is written: “Lameness or blindness”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:21), which indicates that the blemish must be exposed. |
| Deuteronomy 15:21 | we call it “an ill blemish” | Bekhorot 41a:23 | R' Yishmael <b>also</b> does <b>not state</b> a ruling <b>like</b> that of <b>Rava, </b> as <b>perhaps</b> his conclusion that a crack found where there is no bone is not a blemish applies only in a case <b>where it is not conspicuous. But</b> in a case <b>where it is conspicuous, </b> such as the female sex organ, <b>we call it “an ill blemish”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:21), and the animal is disqualified for use as an offering. |
| Deuteronomy 15:22 | “Within your gates” | Bekhorot 15b:8 | <b>Ravina raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: </b> According to R' Ḥanina, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the following matter: <b>Can one dedicate</b> the unborn offspring <b>as any offering he desires? </b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: He may not dedicate them</b> as any offering other than that for which the mother was consecrated. Ravina asked: <b>What is the reason? </b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“Within</b> all <b>your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15), and: <b>“Within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22), written <b>with regard to a firstborn. Just as one cannot dedicate a firstborn as any offering he desires, as it is written: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstborn to YHWH, no man shall sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 27:26), <b>so too, one cannot dedicate these</b> offspring <b>as any offering he desires. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:22 | “Like the gazelle and like the deer” | Bekhorot 33a:4 | § The <i>baraita</i> stated that according to <b>R' Akiva, </b> Beit Hillel <b>deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for non-priests, <b>and even non-Jews, </b> to partake of blemished firstborn offerings. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of R' Akiva? </b> The verse states: <b>“Like the gazelle and like the deer”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22). <b>Just as a gazelle and a deer</b> are <b>permitted to</b> be eaten by <b>a non-Jew, so too, disqualified</b> blemished firstborn offerings are <b>permitted to</b> be eaten by <b>a non-Jew. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 15:22 | states: “Within your gates you may eat it, the impure and the pure | Makkot 19b:6 | The Talmud answers: It is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to second-tithe produce: <b>“You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and later, </b> with regard to a blemished firstborn animal, the verse <b>states: “Within your gates you may eat it, the impure and the pure</b> may eat it alike” (Deuteronomy 15:22). |
| Deuteronomy 15:22 | states: “You shall eat it within your gates” | Yevamot 73b:15 | It was further stated above that <b>one who eats</b> second tithe and first fruits <b>when they themselves, </b> the second tithe and first fruits, <b>are ritually impure is flogged, which is not</b> the case <b>with</b> regard to <b><i>teruma</i>. </b> The Talmud infers from this that <b>it is lashes that he does not receive</b> when he eats <i>teruma</i> that is ritually impure; <b>however, </b> the transgression of <b>a prohibition is</b> involved. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is prohibited? <b>The verse</b> referring to offerings that have been disqualified <b>states: “You shall eat it within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22). The word “it” indicates that it is only <b>this, </b> disqualified offerings, that may be eaten in a state of impurity, <b>but not another</b> type of consecrated food. This is a prohibition that is derived by inference from a positive mitzva, i.e., it is not stated in the Torah in the form of a prohibition. <b>And</b> there is a principle that <b>a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva</b> is classified as <b>a positive mitzva, </b> for which no lashes are administered. |
| Deuteronomy 15:22 | “You shall eat it within your gates, the impure and the pure alike, as the gazelle and as the hart” | Yevamot 73b:7 | The Talmud explains: Rather, <b>this is</b> the <b>dilemma he is raising: From where</b> is it derived that one may not eat it when the tithe <b>itself</b> is in a state of <b>ritual impurity? The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and later it states</b> with regard to offerings that have been disqualified: <b>“You shall eat it within your gates, the impure and the pure alike, as the gazelle and as the hart”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22). <b>And</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Yishmael taught: Even a ritually impure and a ritually pure</b> person <b>may eat</b> together <b>on one table</b> and <b>out of one bowl without concern. And God states: That which I said to you there, </b> with regard to disqualified offerings: <b>“You shall eat it within your gates, ”</b> means regardless of whether it is the individual or the meat that is impure; but <b>here, </b> with regard to second tithe, <b>you may not eat</b> it in that state. From here it is derived that one may not eat second tithe when the tithe itself is ritually impure. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | the Lord, your God, took you out from Egypt at night” | Berakhot 9a:25 | The Talmud cites an alternative explanation of the dispute between R' Elazer ben Azarya and R' Akiva. <b>R' Abba said: Everyone agrees that when</b> the children of <b>Israel were redeemed from Egypt</b> were given permission to leave, <b>they were redeemed only in the evening, as it is stated: </b> “In the spring <b>YHWH, your God, took you out from Egypt at night”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>And when they</b> actually <b>left, they left only during the day, as it is stated: </b> “On the fifteenth of the first month, <b>on the day after the</b> offering of the <b>Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand</b> before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | as it is written: “Observe the month of spring” | Rosh Hashanah21a:8 | § <b>Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> this instruction <b>to Rava: When you see that, </b> according to your calculations, <b>the season of Tevet, </b> i.e., winter, will <b>extend to the sixteenth of Nisan, </b> and the spring equinox will occur after the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>add</b> an extra month <b>to that year, </b> making it a leap year. <b>And do not worry</b> about finding an additional reason to justify making it a leap year, <b>as it is written: “Observe the month of spring”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). That is to say, <b>see to it that the spring of the season, </b> i.e., the spring equinox, <b>is in the new part of Nisan, </b> i.e., the first half, before Passover. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | it is written: “Observe the month of ripening | Rosh Hashanah7a:4 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that the first of Nisan is the New Year <b>for months? As it is written: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a household…And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: </b> And the whole assembly of the congregation <b>shall slaughter it</b> toward evening” (Exodus 12:2–6). <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Observe the month of ripening</b> and keep Passover to YHWH your God; for in the month of ripening YHWH your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night” (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>Which is the month in which there is a ripening</b> of grain? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Nisan, and it is called the first</b> month of the year. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | the season of Nisan. As it is written: “Observe the month of spring | Sanhedrin 13b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The <i>tanna</i> referred to as <b>Aḥerim says: </b> The year is intercalated even on account of <b>a minority of</b> the month, <b>and how much is a minority of</b> the month? <b>Fourteen days. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What do</b> <i>Aḥerim</i> <b>hold? If they hold</b> that <b>the day of the equinox concludes</b> the season, <b>and</b> also that <b>we require all of the Festival</b> to take place in the new season, <b>this</b> condition <b>is</b> fulfilled even if the season is lacking fifteen days. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: <i>Aḥerim</i> are standing in, </b> i.e., discussing, <b>the season of Nisan. As it is written: “Observe the month of spring</b> and keep the <i>Pesaḥ</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:1), from which it is inferred: <b>Preserve</b> the day of <b>the equinox of</b> the <b>spring, </b> to ensure <b>that it will be in the month of Nisan, </b> meaning that the equinox must occur during the first part of the month of Nisan, by the fourteenth, the day the Paschal offering is sacrificed. |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | as it is written: “Observe the month of the spring and offer [ ve’asita ] the Paschal offering” | Zevachim 7b:11 | The Talmud answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Observe the month of the spring and offer [<i>ve’asita</i>] the Paschal offering”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1), teaching <b>that all of the actions [<i>asiyyotav</i>] of</b> the Paschal offering, all of its sacrificial rites, must be performed <b>for the sake of</b> the <b>Paschal offering. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:1 | “Observe the month of the spring | Zevachim 7b:17 | <b>Rather, Rav Safra says</b> that the verses should be expounded as follows: The verse <b>“And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering”</b> teaches the statement <b>of Rav Naḥman, </b> that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. The verse: <b>“Observe the month of the spring</b> and offer the Paschal offering” (Deuteronomy 16:1), teaches that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to sacrifice the Paschal offering without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering. </b> The verse: <b>“And you shall say: </b> It is <b>the sacrifice of</b> YHWH’s <b>Passover”</b> (Exodus 12:27), teaches that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to slaughter it without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner. </b> The term <b>“it is”</b> in the latter verse teaches that <b>both here and there, </b> i.e., with regard to both the offering and the owner, proper intent is <b>indispensable. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:2 | the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering to the Lord your God, of the flock and the herd” | Menachot 82a:10 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering, that he may bring</b> it <b>only from non-sacred</b> money? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And you shall sacrifice the Paschal offering to YHWH your God, of the flock and the herd”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:2). The verse is difficult: <b>Doesn’t the Paschal offering come only from lambs and goats? If so, why does the verse state: “The flock and the herd”? </b> It is <b>to juxtapose all</b> offerings <b>that come from the flock and from the herd to</b> the <b>Paschal offering, </b> teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>Paschal offering</b> is <b>a matter of obligation and comes only from non-sacred</b> money, <b>so too any matter of obligation comes only from non-sacred</b> money. |
| Deuteronomy 16:2 | Rav said: What is ben Dortai’s reason? As it is written: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering to the Lord your God from the flock and from the herd, | Pesachim 70b:6 | <b>Rav said: What is ben Dortai’s reason? As it is written: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering to YHWH your God from the flock and from the herd, </b> in the place which YHWH shall choose to rest His name there” (Deuteronomy 16:2). A question must be asked: Does the Paschal offering come from the herd, i.e., from cattle? <b>Doesn’t the Paschal offering</b> come <b>from only the sheep and from the goats, </b> as commanded in the book of Exodus (12:5)? <b>Rather, </b> the verse should be understood as follows. <b>“Flock”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Paschal offering. “Herd”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festival peace-offering</b> that is brought along with it. <b>And God says: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering, ”</b> thus teaching that the two offerings are sacrificed together. From here ben Dortai derived that the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth is like the Paschal offering in every way, and so it too overrides Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 16:2 | The verse states: “And you shall sacrifice [ vezavaḥta ] the Paschal offering unto the Lord, your God, | Zevachim 7b:15 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And you shall sacrifice [<i>vezavaḥta</i>] the Paschal offering unto YHWH, your God, </b> of the flock and the herd” (Deuteronomy 16:2). By repeating the mitzva to sacrifice the Paschal offering for its sake and for the sake of its owner, the Torah indicates that these two intentions are both indispensable to the sacrificial process. |
| Deuteronomy 16:2 | that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? As it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice the Passover offering unto the Lord, your God, of the flock and the herd” | Zevachim 9a:23 | The Talmud responds: <b>But</b> even without the <i>baraita</i>, Shmuel’s father’s statement is <b>still</b> superfluous, as that <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from that which Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says. As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? As it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice the Passover offering unto YHWH, your God, of the flock and the herd”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:2). Why is the herd mentioned? <b>But isn’t a Paschal offering brought only from the lambs and from the goats? Rather, </b> it is derived <b>from here that a leftover Paschal offering should be</b> sacrificed as an offering <b>brought</b> both <b>from the flock and from the herd. And what is that? </b> It is <b>a peace offering. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | as it is stated: “That you may remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life” | Berakhot 12b:24 | Ben Zoma derived it <b>as it is stated: “That you may remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>The days of your life, </b> refers to daytime alone; however, the addition of the word all, as it is stated: <b>All the days of your life, </b> comes to add nights as well. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “Bread of affliction” | Berakhot 39b:8 | This resolution is reinforced in a unique case, as <b>Rav Pappa said: Everyone agrees that</b> while fulfilling the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover, one places the piece inside the whole and breaks. What is the reason? </b> With regard to <i>matza</i> the phrase <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3) <b>is written, </b> and the poor typically eat their bread in pieces. Therefore, eating <i>matza</i> on Passover evening, the broken <i>matza</i> is also significant. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | the bread of affliction” | Chullin 120a:20 | The Talmud objects: <b>Granted, if it is <i>matza</i>, a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover with</b> this food, as <b>God states</b> with regard to the prohibition against eating leavened bread on Passover: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, even <b>the bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), indicating that one must eat the bread of affliction, <b>but this</b> bread dissolved in water <b>is not</b> considered <b>the bread of affliction. But if</b> the bread <b>is leavened bread, </b> why <b>is he punished with <i>karet</i>? Eating is written with regard to</b> the prohibition against leavened bread, and in this case he did not eat it but rather drank it. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “Bread of affliction” | Menachot 70b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter, </b> that only these five grains are obligated in the separations of <i>ḥalla</i>, derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: </b> This principle is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“bread”</b> and <b>“bread” from</b> the case of <b><i>matza</i>. It is written here, </b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: <b>“And it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, </b> you shall set apart a portion for a gift to YHWH” (Numbers 15:19), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i>: <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). Just as <i>matza</i> can be prepared only from one of those five grains, so too the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> applies only to bread from one of those five grains. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | the verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it matza , the bread of affliction” | Menachot 70b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And there, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i> itself, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it must be from one of those five grains? The Talmud answers: <b>Reish Lakish said, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Yishmael taught, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught, </b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, the bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). This verse indicates that only with regard to <b>substances that will come to</b> a state of <b>leavening</b> does <b>a person fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>by</b> eating <b>them on Passover, </b> provided that he prevents them from becoming leavened. This serves to <b>exclude these</b> foods, i.e., rice, millet, and similar grains, <b>which, </b> even if flour is prepared from them and water is added to their flour, <b>do not come to</b> a state of <b>leavening but to</b> a state of <b>decay [<i>sirḥon</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “bread” is written | Menachot 78b:13 | <b>Rava said: And so</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the matter of the loaves of the thanks offering, </b> i.e., if the loaves were already half-done at the time of the slaughter of the thanks offering, they are consecrated. The Talmud asks: Why is it necessary for Rava to state this? Isn’t it <b>obvious? Here, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, the term <b>“bread” is written</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and here, </b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering, the term <b>“bread” is written. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “The bread of affliction [ leḥem oni ]” | Pesachim 115b:10 | <b>Shmuel said</b> that the phrase: <b>“The bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3) means <b>bread over which one answers [<i>onim</i>] matters, </b> i.e., one recites the Haggadah over <i>matza</i>. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Leḥem oni</i></b> is <b>bread over which one answers many matters. Alternatively, </b> in the verse, <b>“<i>leḥem oni</i>” is</b> actually <b>written</b> without a vav, which means a poor person. <b>Just as</b> it is <b>the manner of a poor</b> person <b>to</b> eat <b>a piece</b> of bread, for lack of a whole loaf, |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | it is written: “That you may remember the day | Pesachim 117b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And one must mention the exodus from Egypt in the <i>kiddush</i></b> of Shabbat day, despite the fact that Shabbat is not directly connected to the Exodus. The proof is that <b>here, </b> with regard to Passover, <b>it is written: “That you may remember the day</b> when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life” (Deuteronomy 16:3); <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). By means of a verbal analogy of the word “day,” these verses teach that one must also recall the Exodus on Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “You shall eat no leavened bread with it” | Pesachim 28b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda? </b> The Talmud explains: <b>There are three verses</b> that <b>are written</b> with regard to this prohibition, and in R' Yehuda’s opinion each one teaches that the prohibition applies at a different time. One verse states: <b>“Leavened bread shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 13:3). Another verse states: <b>“And all that which is leavened you shall not eat; </b> in all your habitations you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). And a 3rd verse states: <b>“You shall eat no leavened bread with it”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread even <b>before its time, </b> on Passover eve. <b>One</b> verse indicates that there is a prohibition against eating leavened bread <b>after its time</b> as well, if a Jew owned it during Passover. <b>And one verse</b> indicates that the prohibition applies <b>during Passover</b> itself. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | said to him: The verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; | Pesachim 35a:13 | Rav Pappa <b>said to him: The verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; </b> seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:3). In light of the juxtaposition of leavened bread and <i>matza</i>, Reish Lakish compares these two types of bread: With regard to those <b>substances</b> through <b>which a person fulfills his obligation to</b> eat <b><i>matza</i>, one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> eating them in their <b>leavened</b> state. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> dough, which was kneaded with wine, oil, or honey, <b>since a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with it, </b> as <b>it is</b> called <b>rich, </b> i.e., enhanced, <b><i>matza</i>, one is not liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> eating it in <b>its leavened</b> state on Passover. <i>Matza</i> is called the bread of affliction, or the poor man’s bread, a description that does not apply to dough prepared with wine, oil, or honey. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | the verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it matza , | Pesachim 35a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that <i>matza</i> cannot be prepared from rice or millet, <b>derived? R' Shimon ben Lakish said, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Yishmael taught, and likewise</b> a Sage <b>of the school of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, </b> the bread of affliction” (Deuteronomy 16:3). This verse indicates that only with <b>substances which will come to</b> a state of <b>leavening, a person fulfills his obligation to</b> eat <b><i>matza</i> with them, </b> provided he prevents them from becoming leavened. This <b>excludes these</b> foods, i.e., rice, millet, and similar grains, <b>which, </b> even if flour is prepared from them and water is added to their flour, <b>do not come to</b> a state of <b>leavening but to</b> a state of <b>decay [<i>siraḥon</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | The verse states: “You shall not eat leavened bread with it; | Pesachim 35b:19 | <b>The verse states: “You shall not eat leavened bread with it; </b> seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:3). One fulfills his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with</b> food <b>whose prohibition</b> is solely <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not eat leavened bread with it, </b> if it was not preserved in an unleavened state. This command <b>excludes this</b> grain, <b>which is not prohibited due to</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not eat leavened bread, but</b> rather <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not eat untithed produce. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | the bread of affliction [ leḥem oni ]” | Pesachim 36a:4 | <b>A baraita states: </b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person can fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <b><i>matza</i></b> on Passover <b>with</b> <i>matza</i> of <b>second tithe in Jerusalem. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, <b>the bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <i>oni</i> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, i.e., poor man’s bread. As this is similar to the phrase: Bread of acute mourning [<i>leḥem oni</i>], <i>oni</i> with an <i>alef</i>, it can be inferred that this mitzva must be fulfilled with <i>matza</i> <b>that</b> can <b>be eaten</b> during a period of <b>acute mourning, </b> on the day one’s close relative has died. This <b>excludes this</b> second tithe, <b>which cannot be eaten during</b> a period of <b>acute mourning but only</b> in a state <b>of joy, </b> as the Torah states: “I have not eaten from it in my acute mourning” (Deuteronomy 26:14). This is <b>the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | Leḥem oni | Pesachim 36b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R' Yosei HaGelili, </b> why does he learn this <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: “In all of your habitations”? <b>Let him derive it from</b> the phrase: <b><i>Leḥem oni</i></b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). R' Yosei HaGelili derives from this expression that <i>matza</i> must be prepared from produce <b>that</b> can <b>be eaten in</b> a state of <b>acute mourning; </b> that <b>excludes this</b> second tithe, <b>which</b> may <b>be eaten only in</b> a state of <b>joy. </b> This exposition should apply to first fruits as well, as they must also be eaten in a state of joy. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “Poor man’s bread” | Pesachim 38a:5 | <b>Rava said, and some say Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya</b> said: This principle can be <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>“bread”</b> and <b>“bread. ” It is written here, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i>: <b>“Poor man’s bread”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: <b>“And it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, </b> you shall set apart a portion for a gift to YHWH” (Numbers 15:19). <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of <i>ḥalla</i>, it must be separated only <b>from</b> food <b>that belongs to you, so too here, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, it must be prepared only <b>from</b> produce <b>that belongs to you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “bread of affliction [ leḥem oni ]” | Pesachim 38b:5 | The Talmud asks a question of both opinions: And <b>let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers, from the phrase <b>“bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). According to R' Yosei HaGelili, this phrase means: One can fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> only <b>with</b> food that may <b>be eaten in</b> a state of <b>acute mourning. </b> This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, i.e., the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite wafers, <b>which is not eaten in</b> a state of <b>acute mourning but in</b> a state <b>of joy, </b> as an acute mourner is prohibited from eating sacrificial foods. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | since it is written: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it matzot ” | Pesachim 43b:1 | as <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), one might have thought that <b>anyone included</b> in the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i> is</b> also <b>included</b> in the <b>prohibition against eating leavened bread. And these women, since they are excluded</b> from the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>, as it is a time-bound, positive mitzva</b> from which they are exempt as a rule, I might <b>say they are also excluded from the prohibition against eating leavened bread. </b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that women are also prohibited from eating leavened bread. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | as it is stated: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; | Pesachim 43b:2 | The Talmud comments: <b>And now</b> that women <b>have been included in the prohibition against eating leavened bread, they</b> should <b>also be included</b> in the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>, </b> even though it is a time-bound, positive mitzva, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer. As R' Eliezer said: Women are obligated to eat <i>matza</i> by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is stated: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; </b> seven days you shall eat with it <i>matzot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:3). These two commandments are juxtaposed to teach that <b>anyone included</b> in <b>the prohibition against eating leavened bread is</b> also <b>included in</b> the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>. And these women too, since they</b> are <b>included</b> in <b>the prohibition against eating leavened bread, they are</b> also <b>included in</b> the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | as it is stated: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat matzot with it” | Pesachim 91b:15 | This is difficult: <b>Does R' Shimon not</b> accept <b>that which R' Elazar said, that women are obligated in</b> the command of <b>eating <i>matza</i> by Torah law, </b> despite the fact that it is a time-bound, positive mitzva, <b>as it is stated: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat <i>matzot</i> with it”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), which teaches that <b>all who are subject to the prohibition to not eat leavened bread</b> are also <b>subject</b> to the positive mitzva to <b>arise and eat <i>matza</i>? And those women, since they are subject to the prohibition to not eat leavened bread, </b> since women are required to observe all the prohibitions of the Torah, <b>they are subject also to</b> the positive mitzva to <b>arise and eat <i>matza</i>. </b> Clearly, R' Shimon was not referring to <i>matza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | “Bread of affliction” | Sukkah 35a:13 | <b>Rav Pappa strongly objects to this: Granted, </b> with regard to <b>dough, it is written: “The first of your dough, </b> <i>ḥalla</i> you shall offer as a gift” (Numbers 15:20). “Your dough” indicates that one is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> only from dough that belongs to him and not consecrated dough. With regard to the <b><i>etrog</i> too it is written: “</b>And you shall take <b>for yourselves, ”</b> indicating that it must be <b>from your own</b> property. <b>However, </b> with regard to <b><i>matza</i>, </b> why does he not fulfill his obligation with second tithe? <b>Is it written: Your <i>matza</i>? Rabba bar Shmuel said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya</b> who said: This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>bread</b> written with regard to <i>matza</i> and <b>bread</b> written with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to <i>matza</i>: <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: |
| Deuteronomy 16:3 | even though he initially boiled it, since he subsequently baked it in an oven, it is called “bread of affliction” | Yevamot 40a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if boiled flour is invalid as a meal offering, then with regard to this statement <b>that we said</b> that <b>boiled</b> flour <b>is unleavened, for what <i>halakha</i></b> is it relevant? The Talmud answers: It is <b>to say that a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover. </b> This is because <b>even though he initially boiled it, since he subsequently baked it in an oven, it is called “bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and</b> therefore <b>a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:4 | another verse was written: “Neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning” | Chagigah 10b:8 | The Talmud responds. With regard <b>to the prohibition</b> against leaving over an offering on a Festival, <b>another verse was written: “Neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:4). The Talmud asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse: “Shall not remain all night” comes to teach that one who does so <b>violates two prohibitions and a positive mitzva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:4 | with you | Pesachim 5b:12 | The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>This <i>tanna</i> seeks permission</b> for seeing the leaven of a non-Jew, and yet <b>he cites a verse to</b> establish <b>a prohibition. </b> The Talmud answers that the <i>tanna</i> did not cite proof from the phrase: It shall not be found. <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: </b> “No leaven shall be seen <b>with you</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7) and “No leaven shall be seen <b>with you</b> in all your borders” (Deuteronomy 16:4) <b>twice, </b> one of them is superfluous and may be appended to: It shall not be found, creating the prohibition: It shall not be found with you. Only leaven belonging to a Jew is prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 16:4 | “Nor shall any of the meat that you sacrifice on the first day at evening remain overnight until the morning” | Pesachim 71a:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> this source alluded to by Rava? The Talmud explains: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Nor shall any of the meat that you sacrifice on the first day at evening remain overnight until the morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:4), |
| Deuteronomy 16:4 | until the morning” | Pesachim 71b:1 | this verse <b>teaches that the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth is eaten for two days and one night; </b> that is, it may not remain overnight until the morning of the sixteenth. <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> eaten <b>for only a day and a night; </b> that is, it may not remain overnight until the morning of the fifteenth. Since for that it would have sufficed to say that an offering sacrificed “on the first day shall not remain overnight,” <b>when it says</b> that an offering sacrificed <b>“on the first day</b> shall not remain overnight <b>until the morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:4), the extra phrase “until the morning” indicates that the verse <b>speaks of the second morning. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:5 | “You may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in any one of your cities” | Pesachim 80a:1 | <b>“You may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in any one of your cities”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:5). R' Elazar ben Matya derived from the expression “in any one” that one person cannot be the determining factor in whether the community sacrifices the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual purity or impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 16:5 | that we do not slaughter a Paschal lamb on behalf on an individual? The verse states: “You may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in any one | Pesachim 91a:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that we do not slaughter a Paschal lamb on behalf on an individual? The verse states: “You may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in any one</b> of your gates, which YHWH your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 16:5). The phrase “in any one” is expounded to mean: For any one person, which indicates that the Paschal lamb is not slaughtered on behalf of an individual; this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. And R' Yosei says: </b> If there is <b>an individual and he is able to eat</b> an olive-bulk of the Paschal lamb, <b>one slaughters it on his behalf; </b> whereas if there are <b>ten</b> people <b>and they are unable to eat</b> together an olive-bulk of the Paschal lamb, <b>we do not slaughter it on their behalf. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:6 | “There you will offer the Paschal lamb, in the evening when the sun sets at the time when you left the land of Egypt” | Berakhot 9a:23 | Concerning the tannaitic dispute between R' Akiva and R' Elazar ben Azarya regarding until when the Paschal lamb may be eaten, the Talmud remarks: The dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> is parallel to</b> the dispute between <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>, </b> who disagree over the same issue. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“There you will offer the Paschal lamb, in the evening when the sun sets at the time when you left the land of Egypt”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:6). Upon closer examination, it seems that this verse mentions three distinct times: In the evening, refers to the afternoon until sunset; when the sun sets, refers to the time of sunset itself; and the time when you left the land of Egypt refers to, as explained in Exodus, the early hours of the morning. Therefore it seems that these times parallel the different stages of the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, and it is regarding these details that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree. |
| Deuteronomy 16:6 | about which it is not stated “in the evening,” but only “in the afternoon.” | Pesachim 59a:1 | <b>An item, </b> i.e., the Paschal lamb, <b>about which it is stated: “In the evening” and “in the afternoon, ” should be</b> sacrificed <b>after an item, </b> the daily afternoon offering, <b>about which it is not stated “in the evening, ” but only “in the afternoon. ”</b> With regard to the Paschal lamb, the verse says: “You shall sacrifice the Paschal lamb in the evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season in which you came out of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:6), and it also says: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:6), whereas regarding the daily afternoon offering it only says: “And the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon” (Numbers 28:4). |
| Deuteronomy 16:6 | it is written: “There you shall sacrifice the Passover offering at evening” | Zevachim 12a:2 | The Talmud asks: Just as it is written explicitly that the Candelabrum must be lit in the evening, <b>there too, </b> with regard to a Paschal offering, <b>it is written: “There you shall sacrifice the Passover offering at evening”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:6). How can ben Beteira claim that it may be sacrificed all day long? |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | “And you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents” | Chagigah 17b:1 | The Talmud answers: One may leave Jerusalem only in the morning, after staying there for the night following the Festival, <b>as it is written</b> following the laws of the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7). |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents” | Pesachim 8b:8 | <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>? And if those</b> animals <b>that typically are harmed</b> by other animals <b>are not harmed, </b> due to the protection provided by the mitzva, <b>people who typically are not harmed, </b> as they are capable of protecting themselves, <b>all the more so, </b> will not be harmed due to the protection provided by the mitzva of ascending to Jerusalem for the Festival. <b>I have only</b> derived that one is protected <b>when going</b> to Jerusalem; <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is protected even <b>when returning</b> from the Temple? <b>The verse states: </b> “You shall roast and eat the Paschal lamb in the place which God your Lord shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7). This <b>teaches that you shall go and</b> upon your return <b>find your tent in peace, </b> unharmed. |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents” | Pesachim 95b:8 | <b>But according to R' Yehuda, does</b> the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>require remaining</b> until morning? <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> does not require remaining</b> until morning? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which YHWH your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7), <b>and it is written</b> immediately after: <b>“Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>; </b> and on the 7th day shall be a solemn assembly to YHWH your God; you shall do no work on it” (Deuteronomy 16:8). From this juxtaposition it may be concluded that the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which is followed by the mitzvah <b>to eat</b> <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, <b>requires remaining</b> until morning, whereas the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which is not followed by the mitzva <b>to eat</b> <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, <b>does not require remaining</b> until morning. This contradicts what was previously stated citing R' Yehuda. |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents” | Rosh Hashanah5a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And there, </b> with regard to Passover, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud explains: <b>As it is written</b> about the Paschal offering: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which YHWH your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7). |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | “And you shall turn in the morning and go unto your tents” | Sukkah 47b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And does R' Yehuda</b> really <b>hold</b> that the <b>8th</b> Day of Assembly <b>requires</b> one to <b>stay overnight</b> at its conclusion? <b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, </b> when the Paschal lamb is brought by those who were impure and unable to sacrifice it on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>does not require staying overnight</b> at its conclusion? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>“And you shall turn in the morning and go unto your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7), and immediately thereafter it is <b>written: “Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8). From the juxtaposition of these two verses R' Yehuda derives the following: <b>That which requires</b> observance of the <b>six</b> subsequent days <b>requires staying overnight; that which does not require</b> observance of the <b>six</b> subsequent days <b>does not require staying overnight. What</b> does this juxtaposition come <b>to exclude? Is it not to exclude</b> the <b>8th day of the Festival, </b> as it is not followed by the observance of six days? |
| Deuteronomy 16:7 | and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents” | Zevachim 97a:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that R' Tarfon says: If one cooked a sin offering in a vessel from the beginning of the Festival, one may cook in it for the entire Festival without scouring and rinsing the vessel after every use and without being concerned that he is eating forbidden leftover meat. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Tarfon? </b> The Talmud answers: It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place that YHWH your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7). Although one does not leave Jerusalem on the first morning of Passover, <b>the verse has rendered all of those</b> days over which one remains there equal to <b>one morning. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | a solemn assembly for the Lord, your God” | Beitzah 15b:16 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said: And both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse, </b> i.e., the two of them addressed the same apparent contradiction between two verses, resolving it in different ways. <b>One verse states: </b> “It shall be <b>a solemn assembly for YHWH, your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), indicating a Festival dedicated to the service of God, <b>and one verse states: “It shall be a solemn assembly for you”</b> (Numbers 29:35), indicating a celebratory assembly for the Jewish people. <b>How is this</b> to be reconciled? <b>R' Eliezer holds</b> that the two verses should be understood as offering a choice: The day is to be <b>either entirely for God, </b> in accordance with the one verse, <b>or entirely for you, </b> as per the other verse; <b>and R' Yehoshua holds</b> that it is possible to fulfill both verses: <b>Split</b> the day into two, <b>half of it for God and half of it for you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | “Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord | Chagigah 18a:8 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the 7th day there shall be a solemn assembly for YHWH</b> your God; on it, you shall do no work” (Deuteronomy 16:8). <b>If</b> so, <b>just as the 7th</b> day of the Festival <b>is precluded</b> from the performance of labor, <b>so are</b> the <b>six</b> intermediate Festival <b>days precluded, </b> since the word “and” in the phrase “and on the 7th day” connects it to the previous days. <b>If so, </b> perhaps: <b>Just as the 7th day is precluded from the performance of all labor, so too the six</b> intermediate <b>days are precluded from the performance of all labor, </b> even those whose performance prevents irretrievable loss. |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | It is stated: “Assembly” | Chagigah 9a:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah taught that if one did not bring his Festival peace-offering on the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, he may bring it even on the 8th Day of Assembly, despite the fact that it is a separate Festival. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Yishmael</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated: “Assembly”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), with regard <b>to the 7th day of Passover, and it is stated: “Assembly”</b> (Leviticus 23:36), with regard <b>to the 8th day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to Passover, the day of assembly, i.e., the 7th day of Passover, is available <b>for redress, </b> as it is certainly part of the Festival, <b>so too here, </b> in the case of <i>Sukkot</i>, the 8th Day of Assembly is available <b>for redress. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | written: “You shall not perform labor” | Chagigah 9a:9 | However, this is <b>not so [<i>la’ei</i>], as</b> the term assembly is certainly <b>free. Now, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“assembly [<i>atzeret</i>]”? </b> It means that one is <b>stopped [<i>atzur</i>], </b> i.e., prohibited, <b>from performing labor. But isn’t it</b> already <b>written: “You shall not perform labor”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8)? <b>Why</b> then <b>do I</b> need this term <b><i>atzeret</i> that God writes? Rather, learn from here</b> that it is <b>free</b> for the verbal analogy. |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | One verse states: “Six days you shall eat unleavened bread” | Menachot 66a:4 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar says</b> there is yet another proof: <b>One verse states: “Six days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8), <b>and one verse states: “Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread”</b> (Exodus 12:15). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? R' Shimon ben Elazar explains that there is <b><i>matza</i> that you are unable to eat for</b> all <b>seven</b> days of Passover, due to the prohibition of harvesting and eating <b>from the new</b> crop of grain that ripened before Passover until after the <i>omer</i> offering. But <b>you are able to eat</b> that same <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, although it is <b>from the new</b> crop, as it is permitted after the bringing of the <i>omer</i> offering on the second day of Passover. This resolution of the verses is possible only if the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, not on any other date. |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | Rava: “Six days you shall eat matzot , and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord your God” | Pesachim 120a:11 | The Talmud comments: It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava: “Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>, and on the 7th day shall be a solemn assembly to YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8). <b>Just as</b> eating <i>matza</i> on the <b>7th</b> day is merely <b>optional, </b> i.e., there is no obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on the last day of Passover, but only to avoid eating leavened bread, as the verse states: “Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>,” <b>so too, </b> eating <i>matza</i> during the first <b>six days</b> is <b>optional. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | one verse says: “It shall be an assembly for the Lord your God; | Pesachim 68b:9 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: And both of them derived</b> their opinions from <b>one verse, </b> i.e., the two of them addressed the same textual difficulty, resolving it in different ways. For <b>one verse says: “It shall be an assembly for YHWH your God; </b> you shall do no labor” (Deuteronomy 16:8), which indicates that the day is set aside for Divine service, <b>and another verse says: “It shall be an assembly for you; </b> you shall do no servile labor” (Numbers 29:35), which indicates a celebratory assembly for the Jewish people. <b>R' Eliezer holds</b> that the two verses should be understood as offering a choice: The day is to be <b>either entirely for God or entirely for you. And R' Yehoshua holds</b> that it is possible to fulfill both verses: <b>Split</b> the day into two, <b>half of it for God and half of it for you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | “Six days you shall eat matzot ; | Pesachim 95b:8 | <b>But according to R' Yehuda, does</b> the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>require remaining</b> until morning? <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> does not require remaining</b> until morning? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which YHWH your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7), <b>and it is written</b> immediately after: <b>“Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>; </b> and on the 7th day shall be a solemn assembly to YHWH your God; you shall do no work on it” (Deuteronomy 16:8). From this juxtaposition it may be concluded that the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which is followed by the mitzvah <b>to eat</b> <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, <b>requires remaining</b> until morning, whereas the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which is not followed by the mitzva <b>to eat</b> <i>matza</i> <b>for six</b> days, <b>does not require remaining</b> until morning. This contradicts what was previously stated citing R' Yehuda. |
| Deuteronomy 16:8 | written: “Six days you shall eat matzot ” | Sukkah 47b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And does R' Yehuda</b> really <b>hold</b> that the <b>8th</b> Day of Assembly <b>requires</b> one to <b>stay overnight</b> at its conclusion? <b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, </b> when the Paschal lamb is brought by those who were impure and unable to sacrifice it on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>does not require staying overnight</b> at its conclusion? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>“And you shall turn in the morning and go unto your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7), and immediately thereafter it is <b>written: “Six days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:8). From the juxtaposition of these two verses R' Yehuda derives the following: <b>That which requires</b> observance of the <b>six</b> subsequent days <b>requires staying overnight; that which does not require</b> observance of the <b>six</b> subsequent days <b>does not require staying overnight. What</b> does this juxtaposition come <b>to exclude? Is it not to exclude</b> the <b>8th day of the Festival, </b> as it is not followed by the observance of six days? |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain” | Bava Metzia87b:6 | The Talmud answers: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“standing”</b> written here and the term <b>“standing”</b> written elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to harvesting the barley for the <i>omer</i> offering: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself; <b>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9). <b>Just as there, </b> in the verse referring to the harvesting of the <i>omer</i>, it is the owner of <b>standing</b> grain <b>who is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, </b> as barley is one of the five grains, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to a laborer, it is discussing <b>standing</b> grain <b>whose</b> owner <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | a mitzva to count weeks, as it is written: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself, | Chagigah 17b:8 | <b>Rava said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Is that to say</b> that for <b><i>Shavuot</i> we count days</b> but <b>we do not count weeks? Didn’t Abaye say: </b> It is <b>a mitzva to count days, </b> in the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>as it is written: </b> “Until the morrow of the 7th week, <b>you shall count fifty days”</b> (Leviticus 23:16); <b>and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count weeks, as it is written: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself, </b> from when the sickle is first put to the standing corn” (Deuteronomy 16:9); <b>and further, it is written: “The festival of weeks [<i>shavuot</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10), which indicates that it is a Festival that is established through a count of weeks? Consequently, the days of redress for <i>Shavuot</i> should last a week, in accordance with its components. |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | you shall number for you; | Menachot 65b:5 | <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> The previous proof <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: </b> “Seven weeks <b>you shall number for you; </b> from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). The term “for you” indicates that the <b>counting</b> of the weeks <b>is dependent upon</b> the decision of the <b>court, as they know</b> how to <b>calculate the new</b> months, upon which the date of the Festival depends. Therefore, when the verse states: <b>“The morrow after the day of rest [<i>hashabbat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:16), it means: <b>The morrow after the Festival, </b> as the determination of Festivals is by the court. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the interpretation that the counting starts after the <b>Shabbat of Creation, </b> i.e., a regular weekly Shabbat, <b>whose counting</b> can be performed <b>by every person, </b> not exclusively by the court. |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | you shall number for you; | Menachot 66a:1 | <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: </b> “Seven weeks <b>you shall number for you; </b> from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). By using the term “for you,” the verse indicates that the <b>counting</b> of the weeks <b>is dependent upon</b> the decision of the <b>court, </b> as they know how to calculate the new months. This serves to <b>exclude</b> the possibility that the counting starts after the <b>Shabbat of Creation, whose counting</b> can be performed <b>by every person, </b> not only the court. |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number | Menachot 66a:6 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “Seven weeks you shall number for you; <b>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number</b> seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). This verse indicates that the counting should commence upon the reaping of the grain for the <i>omer</i> offering. <b>If</b> one would read just this verse: <b>“From the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain you shall begin to number, ”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one can <b>harvest and count and</b> then <b>bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>whenever he wishes. </b> Therefore, <b>the</b> other <b>verse states: “From the day that you brought</b> the sheaf of the waving…you shall number fifty days,” indicating that the counting should start on the day the <i>omer</i> offering is brought. |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | from the time the sickle is first put | Menachot 71a:4 | <b>Rather, Shmuel said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse discussing the counting of the <i>omer</i>: “Seven weeks you shall number for you; <b>from the time the sickle is first put</b> to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks” (Deuteronomy 16:9). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference</b> that there is grain at an earlier stage <b>that cannot</b> be cut with <b>a sickle, </b> which nevertheless is permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering? This description applies to grain that has taken root. The Talmud rejects this claim as well: Perhaps the inference is to grain at an earlier stage <b>that cannot</b> be cut with <b>a sickle but</b> is <b>actually fodder, </b> i.e., produce that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe. |
| Deuteronomy 16:9 | “The standing grain” | Menachot 71a:5 | <b>R' Yitzḥak said: </b> One can derive that grain that has taken root is permitted by the <i>omer</i> offering from the term: <b>“The standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9). Can one <b>not</b> learn from here <b>by inference that</b> there is grain that is too soft <b>and unable to stand, </b> which may not be used for the <i>omer</i> offering and yet is permitted by the <i>omer</i>? The Talmud rejects this claim as well: Perhaps the inference is to grain <b>that is unable to stand</b> but is <b>actually</b> soft grain like that of <b>a marsh; </b> it has grown somewhat but is still soft enough that it bends rather than stands. |
| Deuteronomy 16:10 | and further, it is written: “The festival of weeks [ shavuot ]” | Chagigah 17b:8 | <b>Rava said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Is that to say</b> that for <b><i>Shavuot</i> we count days</b> but <b>we do not count weeks? Didn’t Abaye say: </b> It is <b>a mitzva to count days, </b> in the counting of the <i>omer</i>, <b>as it is written: </b> “Until the morrow of the 7th week, <b>you shall count fifty days”</b> (Leviticus 23:16); <b>and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count weeks, as it is written: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself, </b> from when the sickle is first put to the standing corn” (Deuteronomy 16:9); <b>and further, it is written: “The festival of weeks [<i>shavuot</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10), which indicates that it is a Festival that is established through a count of weeks? Consequently, the days of redress for <i>Shavuot</i> should last a week, in accordance with its components. |
| Deuteronomy 16:10 | After the measure | Chagigah 8a:4 | The Talmud comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya, </b> and <b>it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoḥanan. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoḥanan: </b> “<b>After the measure</b> of the gift offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 16:10). This <b>teaches that a person brings his obligatory</b> offering <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one wishes to mix he</b> may <b>mix? The verse states: “As YHWH your God blesses you”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10), i.e., one may use any money with which God has blessed him, even second tithe. The term: Mix, means combining money from different sources. |
| Deuteronomy 16:10 | Ḥizkiya: “After the measure” | Chagigah 8a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya: “After the measure”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10). This <b>teaches that a person brings his obligatory</b> offering <b>from non-sacred</b> property. Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to this issue, as <b>Beit Shammai say: </b> On <b>the first day</b> one may bring only <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> one may buy the animal <b>from the</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money. <b>And Beit Hillel say: The first eating</b> must be <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> one may bring <b>from the</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money. The phrase: The first eating, means the first animal that one eats, which is in accordance with Ḥizkiya’s opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 16:11 | a widow, | Kiddushin 34b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>What can be said</b> with regard to <b>a widow, </b> who no longer has a husband but is nevertheless obligated to be joyful on a Festival, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice before YHWH your God, you…and the widow” (Deuteronomy 16:11)? The Talmud answers that the mitzva does not apply directly to a widow; rather, it applies <b>to</b> the men <b>with whom she is present, </b> i.e., they have an obligation to ensure that widows rejoice on the Festivals. |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress” | Rosh Hashanah13a:14 | § <b>R' Ḥanina strongly objects to</b> the proof brought from the verse in Exodus cited above, which refers to <i>Sukkot</i> as the festival of gathering: <b>How can you say</b> that <b>this “gathering” means harvesting? But isn’t it written: </b> “You shall observe the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> seven days, <b>after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), <b>and the Master said</b> about this: <b>The verse speaks</b> here <b>of the waste of the threshing floor and the winepress, </b> which is used to make the roof of the <i>sukka</i>. If so, the gathering mentioned with regard to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is referring not to harvesting but to gathering straw from the threshing floor. |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | “After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress” | Rosh Hashanah14a:6 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: </b> The verse states: <b>“After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the grain that is brought to the <b>threshing floor and</b> the wine that is brought to the <b>winepress are special in that they grow on the outgoing year’s water, </b> i.e., the moisture in the ground from the previous winter’s rain, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, so too, anything that grows on the outgoing year’s water is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year. </b> This comes to <b>exclude vegetables, which grow on the incoming year’s water, </b> as their growth cycle is short and they are nurtured by the rain that falls while they are growing. Consequently, <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | the verse states: “You shall prepare for you the festival of Sukkot ” | Sukkah 11b:16 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states: “You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). The expression “festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” <b>likens <i>sukka</i> to the Festival peace-offering</b> [<b><i>ḥagiga</i>]. Just as the Festival peace-offering is an item not susceptible to ritual impurity, and its growth is from the ground, </b> as animals draw nourishment from vegetation, <b>so too, </b> the roofing of <b>the <i>sukka</i></b> must be <b>a substance that is not susceptible to ritual impurity and its growth is from the ground. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | with regard to a sukka : | Sukkah 11b:4 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a different <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one attached</b> the ritual fringes <b>and</b> only <b>afterward cut the ends of their strands, they are unfit. And furthermore, it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a <i>sukka</i>: </b> The verse states: “Prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:13), and from the language of this verse the rabbis derived the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared. From here</b> the rabbis <b>said: If one trellised a grapevine, a gourd</b> plant, <b>or ivy</b> over a <i>sukka</i> while still attached to the ground, <b>and</b> then he added <b>roofing atop</b> the vines, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | as you gather from your threshing floor and from your winepress” | Sukkah 12a:2 | The Talmud cites a different source: <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days <b>as you gather from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), and the rabbis interpreted that it is <b>with regard to the waste of the threshing floor and of the winepress</b> that <b>the verse is speaking. </b> One uses grain stalks and vines for roofing the <i>sukka</i>, materials that are not susceptible to ritual impurity and grow from the ground. |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | the verse states: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of Sukkot for seven days” | Sukkah 23a:5 | § The Mishnah continues: <b>Or</b> if one establishes his <i>sukka</i> <b>atop a camel, </b> the <i>sukka</i> is fit. The Talmud asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the Mishnah? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> atop an animal, R' Meir deems</b> it <b>fit and R' Yehuda deems</b> it <b>unfit. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda? </b> The Talmud answers that it is as <b>the verse states: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), from which R' Yehuda derives: <b>A <i>sukka</i> that is suitable for seven</b> days <b>is called a <i>sukka</i>, </b> while <b>a <i>sukka</i> that is not suitable for seven</b> days <b>is not called a <i>sukka</i>. </b> It is prohibited to climb upon an animal on the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and therefore a <i>sukka</i> atop an animal is unfit, as it cannot be used all seven days. |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | the verse says: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of Sukkot for seven days” | Sukkah 27b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Eliezer</b> that it is prohibited to move from one <i>sukka</i> to another during the Festival? The Talmud explains it is as <b>the verse says: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13); this is interpreted to mean: <b>Establish a <i>sukka</i> that is suitable for seven</b> days. It is considered a <i>sukka</i> suitable for the mitzva only if it is established for seven days. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret this verse? The Talmud answers: In their opinion, <b>this</b> is what the <b>Merciful One is saying: </b> If one did not establish a <i>sukka</i> on the eve of the Festival, he should <b>establish a <i>sukka</i> during the Festival. </b> The obligation to establish a <i>sukka</i> is in effect all seven days of the Festival. |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | so too, a person does not fulfill his obligation with the sukka of another, as it is written: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of Sukkot for seven days” | Sukkah 27b:4 | <b>It is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer says: Just as a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the Festival with the <i>lulav</i> of another, as it is written: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), and the rabbis derive from the phrase: Shall take for yourselves, that it must be taken <b>from your own</b> and not from that of someone else, <b>so too, a person does not fulfill his obligation with the <i>sukka</i> of another, as it is written: “You shall prepare for yourself the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), and the rabbis derive from the term “for yourself” that it must be taken <b>from your own. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | “You shall prepare for you the festival of Sukkot ” | Sukkah 9a:11 | The Talmud answers: It is <b>different there, as the verse states: “You shall prepare for you fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), from which it is derived: <b>“For you, ” for the sake of your obligation. </b> The fringes, from the beginning of their production, must be produced for the sake of the mitzva. The Talmud asks: <b>Here, too, </b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the verse says: <b>“You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). Shouldn’t it be derived: <b>“For you, ” for the sake of your obligation? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:13 | Another verse is written: “You shall prepare for you the festival of Sukkot for seven days” | Sukkah 9a:6 | <b>Rather, what is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai</b> with regard to an old <i>sukka</i>? <b>Another verse is written: “You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), from which it is derived that <b>we require a <i>sukka</i> established for the sake of the Festival. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:14 | “And you shall rejoice in your feast” | Chagigah 8a:9 | § The Mishnah stated that <b>Israelites fulfill their obligation</b> to eat peace-offerings of rejoicing <b>with</b> their <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings. <b>A baraita states</b> that the verse: <b>“And you shall rejoice in your feast”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14) comes <b>to include all types of rejoicing as</b> constituting a fulfillment of the mitzva of <b>rejoicing. From here the rabbis stated: Israelites fulfill their obligation</b> to eat peace-offerings of rejoicing <b>with</b> their <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings <b>and</b> likewise <b>with animal tithes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:14 | And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [ vesamakhta ] on your Festival” | Megillah 16b:8 | § The Talmud returns to its explanation of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor”</b> (Esther 8:16). <b>Rav Yehuda said: “Light”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that they once again studied. <b>And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>“Gladness” [<i>simḥa</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festivals</b> that they once again observed. <b>And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [<i>vesamakhta</i>] on your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>“Joy” [<i>sasson</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision, </b> as they once again circumcised their sons. <b>And similarly it says: “I rejoice [<i>sas</i>] at Your word”</b> (Psalms 119:162), which the rabbis understood as referring to David’s rejoicing over the mitzva of circumcision. |
| Deuteronomy 16:14 | his mourning on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival” | Moed Katan14b:8 | § <b>A mourner does not practice</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>his mourning on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). |
| Deuteronomy 16:14 | a Festival? As it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival” | Moed Katan8b:10 | <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna is</b> actually a statement <b>of Rav, as Rav Daniel bar Ketina said that Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival? As it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). This verse emphasizes that you must rejoice <b>in your Festival and not in your wife. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:14 | The Sages taught: A man is obligated to gladden his children and the members of his household on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice on your Festival, | Pesachim 109a:3 | <b>A baraita states: A man is obligated to gladden his children and the members of his household on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice on your Festival, </b> you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your female slave, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow that are within your gates” (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>With what</b> should <b>one make them rejoice? With wine. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:15 | supports him. | Pesachim 71a:2 | The Talmud proposes: <b>Let us say that</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him. </b> The verse states: “Seven days shall you celebrate to YHWH your God in the place that YHWH shall choose, for YHWH your God shall bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be but joyous” (Deuteronomy 16:15). This verse seems superfluous, as it was already stated in the previous verse: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival. ” The <i>baraita</i> expounds: <b>“And you shall be but joyous”</b> comes <b>to include the last night of the Festival. </b> Even then you must make sure there is <b>rejoicing</b> by eating the appropriate peace-offerings. The <i>baraita</i> considers: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse comes to include <b>the last night of the Festival? Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> comes to include <b>only the first night of the Festival. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “And you shall be <b>but joyous”; </b> the word “but” <b>restricts</b> this mitzva, meaning that there is not always a mitzva to be joyous. |
| Deuteronomy 16:15 | “And you shall be altogether joyful” | Sukkah 48a:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that on the 8th day of the Festival one is obligated to rejoice, derived? It is <b>as A baraita states</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>“And you shall be altogether joyful”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:15). The verse comes <b>to include the evenings of the last day of the Festival, </b> i.e., then too, one is obligated to rejoice by partaking of the meat of the peace-offerings sacrificed the previous day. The Talmud asks: Does the verse come to include the evening of the 8th day? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> comes to include <b>only the</b> evening of <b>the first day of the Festival. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>When</b> the verse <b>says: Altogether, </b> it is exclusionary, and <b>it</b> has <b>distinguished</b> this night from the other nights of the Festival. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of Matzot , on the festival of Shavuot , and on the festival of Sukkot ” | Beitzah 19b:3 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>R' Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of <i>Matzot</i>, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16), to teach: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that comes on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and any</b> offering <b>that does not come on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may not come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> or on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. R' Elazar ben Shimon, says: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> and fulfill with it his obligation</b> to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing. </b> One fulfills the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival by eating the meat of offerings, and this obligation can be fulfilled with the meat of a thanks-offering. <b>But he does not fulfill</b> with it the obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of Shavuot , and on the festival of Sukkot ” | Chagigah 17a:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>R' Elazar said</b> that <b>R' Oshaya said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> offerings <b>can be redressed, </b> i.e., that the obligatory Festival offerings can be sacrificed <b>all seven</b> days following the Festival? <b>As it is stated: </b> “Three times a year all your males shall appear…<b>on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16). The verse compares <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> to the festival of Passover by analogy: Just as one can redress the failure to bring the offering on the festival of Passover on all seven</b> days of the Festival, <b>so too, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, one can redress the failure to bring the offering for all seven, </b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i> and the six days following it. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | the burnt-offering of appearance | Kiddushin 17a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let us derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“empty”</b> and <b>“empty” from</b> the case of <b>the burnt-offering of appearance</b> in the Temple brought on the pilgrimage Festivals, with regard to which it is said: “And they shall not appear before YHWH empty” (Deuteronomy 16:16). The burnt-offering of appearance has no fixed value. The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “Of that with which YHWH your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of Shavuot , | Moed Katan24b:9 | In both of these cases, a Sage presented an opinion as their own, without attributing it to the original Sage who stated it, <b>for R' Elazar said</b> that <b>R' Oshaya said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offerings <b>have redress all seven</b> subsequent <b>days? </b> That is to say, if someone failed to bring the Festival offering on the Festival itself, he has six more days to bring it. <b>As it is stated: </b> “Three times a year shall all your males appear before YHWH your God in the place that He shall choose; <b>on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, </b> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16). <b>Just as</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of Passover have redress all seven</b> days, as Passover is seven days long, <b>so too</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> have redress all seven</b> days, during the week following <i>Shavuot</i>. From this we learn that <i>Shavuot</i> is treated like a seven-day Festival for all halakhic purposes. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | to mention “the festival of Sukkot ” | Rosh Hashanah4b:10 | The Talmud asks further: <b>And R' Elazar ben Shimon, </b> who says that once the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> has passed one immediately transgresses the prohibition against delaying, <b>what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? The Talmud explains: It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Elazar ben Shimon, says: It was not necessary for</b> the verse <b>to mention “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16), <b>of which the</b> immediately preceding <b>text was speaking. </b> If so, <b>why is it stated? </b> It is <b>to say that this</b> Festival is what <b>causes</b> one to be considered late in fulfilling his vow, since by the end of the Festival he must bring all of his current vows to the Temple, whether he took his vow shortly before <i>Sukkot</i> or much earlier. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | why, | Rosh Hashanah4b:3 | The Talmud proceeds to explain the various opinions: <b>What is the rationale of the first <i>tanna</i>? Since</b> the entire chapter (Deuteronomy, chapter 16) <b>has just concluded</b> a discussion of the three pilgrimage Festivals, <b>why, </b> after stating: “Three times a year shall all your males appear before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 16:16), <b>do I</b> need the Torah to <b>write again: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>; </b> and they shall not appear before YHWH empty-handed” (Deuteronomy 16:16)? Rather, <b>learn from here</b> that the verse comes to teach with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>You shall not delay, </b> that one does not transgress the prohibition unless these three Festivals have passed. |
| Deuteronomy 16:16 | and Rabbi Shimon, | Rosh Hashanah5a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>and R' Shimon, </b> who learn from the verse: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16), that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only after three Festivals have passed, <b>from where do they</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offering <b>has redress</b> for seven days? |
| Deuteronomy 16:17 | it is stated: “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which He has given you” | Chagigah 8b:5 | <b>If</b> both <b>these and those, </b> his property and the members of his household, <b>are few, with regard to this</b> individual <b>it is stated</b> in the Mishnah (2a) that the rabbis established the smallest amount of one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i></b> for the burnt-offering of appearance in the Temple and <b>two silver</b> coins for the Festival peace-offerings. <b>If both</b> his eaters and his property <b>are many, with regard to this</b> individual <b>it is stated: “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of YHWH your God, which He has given you”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:17). |
| Deuteronomy 16:18 | as though he plants an ashera among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Judges and officers you shall make for yourself in all of your gates” | Avodah Zarah52a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Yishmael, how does he interpret this verse? The Talmud answers: R' Yishmael <b>requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Reish Lakish</b> says, <b>as Reish Lakish says: Anyone who appoints</b> over the community <b>a judge who is unfit</b> for the position, due to his lack of knowledge or wickedness, is considered <b>as though he plants an <i>ashera</i> among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Judges and officers you shall make for yourself in all of your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“You shall not plant for yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree</b> beside the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 16:21). |
| Deuteronomy 16:18 | in all your gates” | Makkot 7a:8 | <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: </b> “Judges and officers you shall appoint <b>in all your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:18), which indicates that the mitzva to establish a Sanhedrin is in effect where the gates are yours, i.e., only in Eretz Yisrael? The explanation is as follows: <b>In your gates, </b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>you establish courts in each and every district and in each and every city, and outside Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>you establish</b> courts <b>in each and every district, but you do not establish</b> courts <b>in each and every city. </b> The requirement to establish courts in every city is only in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 16:18 | Jewish people? The verse states: “You shall place judges | Sanhedrin 16b:10 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> society must <b>establish judges for</b> the <b>Jewish people? The verse states: “You shall place judges</b> and officers over you in all of your gates that YHWH your God gives you for your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment” (Deuteronomy 16:18). <b>From where</b> is it derived that society must also establish <b>officers for</b> the <b>Jewish people? The</b> same <b>verse states: “You shall place</b> judges and <b>officers. ” From where</b> is it derived that society must also establish <b>judges</b> not only for the entire Jewish people but also <b>for each and every tribe? The verse states: </b> “You shall place <b>judges</b> and officers…<b>for your tribes. ” From where</b> is it derived that society must also establish <b>officers for each and every tribe? The</b> same <b>verse states: </b> “You shall place judges and <b>officers</b>…<b>for your tribes. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:18 | [ ashera ] among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “You shall make judges and officers for yourself” | Sanhedrin 7b:8 | <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who appoints over the community a judge who is not fit, </b> it is <b>as though</b> he <b>plants a tree</b> used as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>] among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “You shall make judges and officers for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it, </b> it is written: <b>“You shall not plant yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:21). By implication, appointing unfit judges is akin to planting a tree for idolatry. <b>Rav Ashi says: And in a place where there are Torah scholars, </b> it is <b>as though</b> he <b>planted</b> the tree <b>next to the altar, as it is stated: </b> “You shall not plant yourself an <i>ashera</i>…<b>beside the altar of YHWH your God. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:19 | it is already stated: “You shall not wrest judgment” | Ketubot 105a:10 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall take no bribe”</b> (Exodus 23:8); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>If</b> it comes <b>to teach that</b> one should <b>not acquit the guilty and</b> one should <b>not convict the innocent</b> due to a bribe, <b>it is already stated: “You shall not wrest judgment”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:19). <b>Rather, </b> this verse teaches that <b>even</b> if the purpose of the bribe is <b>to</b> ensure that one <b>acquit the innocent and convict the guilty, the Torah</b> nevertheless <b>says: “And you shall take no bribe. ”</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for a judge to receive anything from the litigants, even if there is no concern at all that justice will be perverted. |
| Deuteronomy 16:19 | The Sages taught: “For a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise” | Ketubot 105a:16 | <b>A baraita states: “For a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:19); <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> it will certainly blind the eyes <b>of fools. “And perverts the words of the righteous”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:19); <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> it will certainly pervert the statements <b>of the wicked. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Are fools and the wicked suitable for judgment, </b> i.e., to be appointed as judges? <b>Rather, this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>said: “For a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise”; even</b> if he were <b>very wise but he took a bribe, </b> he <b>will not leave</b> this <b>world without</b> suffering <b>blindness of the heart, </b> i.e., he will eventually turn foolish. <b>“And perverts the words of the righteous”; </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:20 | “Justice, justice shall you follow” | Ketubot 103b:25 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi was <b>lying</b> ill in <b>Tzippori and a</b> burial <b>site was ready for him in Beit She’arim. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Justice, justice shall you follow”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:20); <b>follow R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to Beit She’arim, </b> i.e., one should seek to have his case adjudicated by R' Yehuda HaNasi’s court in Beit She’arim. This indicates that Beit She’arim, not Tzippori, was R' Yehuda HaNasi’s place of residence, and therefore he must have been lying ill in Beit She’arim. |
| Deuteronomy 16:20 | “Justice, justice, shall you follow” | Sanhedrin 32b:4 | This distinction is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: It <b>is written</b> in one verse: <b>“In justice shall you judge your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:20), with the repetition indicating that it is not enough to merely judge with justice. He continues: <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here, </b> this latter verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a possibly <b>fraudulent trial, </b> where the court must take extra care to judge with justice; and <b>there, </b> that former verse is stated <b>with regard to a trial that</b> does <b>not</b> appear <b>fraudulent. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:21 | as it is stated: “You shall not plant for yourself an ashera of any kind of tree beside the altar | Avodah Zarah52a:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Akiva, from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud answers: R' Akiva <b>derives it from</b> that <b>which Rav Ḥisda</b> says that <b>Rav says, as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship requires interment? </b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not plant for yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree beside the altar</b> of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 16:21). The verse juxtaposes an <i>ashera</i>, a tree used as part of idolatrous rites, to the altar. This indicates that <b>just as</b> the <b>altar requires interment, so too an <i>ashera</i> requires interment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 16:21 | “You shall not plant for yourself an ashera of any kind of tree | Avodah Zarah52a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Yishmael, how does he interpret this verse? The Talmud answers: R' Yishmael <b>requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Reish Lakish</b> says, <b>as Reish Lakish says: Anyone who appoints</b> over the community <b>a judge who is unfit</b> for the position, due to his lack of knowledge or wickedness, is considered <b>as though he plants an <i>ashera</i> among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Judges and officers you shall make for yourself in all of your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“You shall not plant for yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree</b> beside the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 16:21). |
| Deuteronomy 16:21 | “You shall not plant yourself an ashera of any kind of tree” | Sanhedrin 7b:8 | <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who appoints over the community a judge who is not fit, </b> it is <b>as though</b> he <b>plants a tree</b> used as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>] among the Jewish people, as it is stated: “You shall make judges and officers for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it, </b> it is written: <b>“You shall not plant yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:21).

| Deuteronomy 16:21 | courtyard? The verse states: “You shall not plant for yourself an ashera of any kind of tree beside the altar of the Lord your God” | Tamid 28b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the priests would walk along the portico surrounding the Temple courtyard. Since porticoes were usually made of wood, the Talmud asks: <b>And were there porticoes in the courtyard? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not build</b> wooden <b>porticoes in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard? The verse states: “You shall not plant for yourself an <i>ashera</i> of any kind of tree beside the altar of YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:21). |
| Deuteronomy 17:1 | as it is stated: “You shall not sacrifice to the Lord an ox, or a sheep, | Bekhorot 14b:5 | <b>As R' Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who slaughters a blemished animal upon</b> a private <b>altar of an individual at a time when</b> private <b>altars are permitted is in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not sacrifice to YHWH an ox, or a sheep, </b> in which is a blemish” (Deuteronomy 17:1). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>matter of a great</b> public <b>altar, </b> since that <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different verse, <b>as it is written: “Blind or broken</b>…you shall not sacrifice these unto YHWH” (Leviticus 22:22), <b>apply</b> the verse in Deuteronomy to the <b>matter of</b> a private <b>altar of an individual. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:1 | evil thing” | Zevachim 36a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And does R' Yehuda accept this reasoning</b> that it must be a place of threefold functionality? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> that the verse states: “You shall not sacrifice to YHWH your God an ox, or a sheep, that has a blemish, even any <b>evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:1). The verse <b>included here a sin offering that one slaughtered in the south</b> and not on the northern side of the Temple courtyard as required, <b>and</b> likewise <b>a sin offering whose blood entered inside, </b> i.e., it was slaughtered with the intent that its blood would be brought inside the Sanctuary, that they are <b>disqualified. </b> This indicates that an offering slaughtered with improper intent with regard to a place that lacks threefold functionality nevertheless renders the offering not valid. |
| Deuteronomy 17:1 | any evil thing” | Zevachim 36b:2 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says: </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that with regard to <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered in the south, he would be liable</b> for it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not sacrifice to YHWH your God an ox, or a sheep, </b> that has a blemish, even <b>any evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:1), to teach that <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>an evil thing, </b> such as a blemished offering, <b>you deem him liable</b> to receive lashes, <b>but you do not deem him liable for a sin offering that he slaughtered in the south. </b> The Talmud answers: Here too, there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, </b> and they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:2 | and is stated “your gates” above, | Ketubot 45b:7 | The Talmud answers: <b>It is stated “your gates” below, </b> in that verse, <b>and is stated “your gates” above, </b> in this verse: “If there is found in the midst of you, within any of your gates…a man or woman who does that which is evil in the sight of YHWH your God, in transgressing His covenant” (Deuteronomy 17:2). <b>Just as “your gates” stated above</b> is referring to the <b>gate where he worshipped, so too</b> the phrase <b>“your gates” stated below, </b> with regard to execution, means the <b>gate where he worshipped</b> idols. |
| Deuteronomy 17:3 | which I have not commanded” | Megillah 9b:2 | The verse: <b>“And has gone and served other gods, </b> and worshipped them, either the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, <b>which I have not commanded”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), could be understood as indicating that God did not command their existence, i.e., these entities created themselves. Therefore, when these Elders translated the verse they added a word to the end of the verse to make it read: Which I have not commanded <b>to serve them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:3 | the verse states: “And has gone and served other gods and bowed to them” | Sanhedrin 60b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “And has gone and served other gods and bowed to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), <b>and</b> a verse <b>near it</b> states: <b>“Then you shall bring forth that man</b> or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them with stones and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). It is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses that one who bows down to an idol is liable to be executed. |
| Deuteronomy 17:4 | “If it be told to you and you have heard it and inquired diligently” | Sanhedrin 40a:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source for these seven interrogations? <b>Rav Yehuda says: </b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to an idolatrous city: <b>“And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:15); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to one who worships idols: <b>“If it be told to you and you have heard it and inquired diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:4); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And the judges shall inquire diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18). Taken together, there are seven interrogations alluded to in these verses by each instance of the terms inquire, investigate, and diligently. |
| Deuteronomy 17:4 | certain” | Sanhedrin 40b:9 | <b>Rather, Rav Yehuda said: </b> There are an additional two phrases in the verses that are used to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the seven interrogations. The verse states with regard to the idolatrous city: “And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently <b>and behold it be truth, </b> the matter <b>certain”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:15). Additionally, the verse states with regard to idol worship: “You have inquired diligently <b>and behold it be truth, </b> the matter <b>certain”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:4). When one adds the two usages of “truth” and “certain” to the seven expressions stated earlier, <b>consequently, </b> there are <b>eleven</b> expressions; <b>seven</b> are used <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>seven interrogations, </b> and of the four that remain, <b>remove three, </b> one for each verse, <b>for</b> the purpose of the <b>verbal analogy, </b> and <b>one remains. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:4 | raises an objection | Sanhedrin 41a:19 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to testimony: “And behold it be truth, the matter certain” (Deuteronomy 17:4). The meaning of <b>“certain”</b> is that the testimony of the two witnesses <b>must be congruent. </b> If <b>one</b> witness <b>says: </b> The murderer <b>killed</b> the victim <b>with a sword, and one says: </b> The murderer <b>killed</b> the victim <b>with an <i>ariran</i>, </b> or if <b>one</b> of the witnesses <b>says: </b> The murderer’s <b>garments</b> were <b>black, and one</b> of the witnesses <b>says: </b> The murderer’s <b>garments</b> were <b>white, this is not congruent</b> testimony. This contradicts the ruling of Rav Ḥisda. The Talmud answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> that <i>baraita</i> as speaking <b>about a scarf with which</b> the murderer <b>strangled</b> the victim, <b>as this is</b> the same as a contradiction with regard to <b>a sword and an <i>ariran</i>. </b> As Rav Ḥisda himself ruled, a contradiction concerning details of the murder weapon renders the testimony incongruent. |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | As the Sages taught: | Ketubot 45b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that one stones an idol worshipper in the place where he worshipped? <b>As A baraita states: </b> It states with regard to one who worshipped an idol: “Then you shall bring forth that man or that women who have done this evil thing, to your gates…and you shall stone them with stones that they die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). <b>“Your gates, ” this is the gate where he worshipped</b> idolatry. The offender is taken there to be stoned. Do <b>you say</b> it is <b>the gate where he worshipped, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only the gate where he was sentenced, </b> i.e., the gate of the court? |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | “And you shall take that man or that woman out… | Sanhedrin 112a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t R' Ḥama bar Yosei say</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall take that man or that woman out…</b>to your gates” (Deuteronomy 17:5), from which it is derived: <b>You take a man and a woman out to your gates</b> and they are judged by the local court, <b>but you do not take the entire city out to your gates; </b> instead, they stand trial before the Great Sanhedrin. <b>Rather, </b> the procedure is that <b>one increases</b> the number of <b>courts for them and</b> those courts <b>analyze their cases, </b> and when they conclude that a majority of the inhabitants are guilty of idolatry they are not sentenced; instead, <b>we take them to the High Court [Sanhedrin] and</b> the court <b>issues</b> the <b>verdict of</b> the idolaters <b>and executes them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | “And you shall take out that man or that woman | Sanhedrin 16a:5 | Ravina continues: <b>Doesn’t R' Ḥama ben Yosei, say</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: </b> The verse that discuses an individual who serves idol worship states: <b>“And you shall take out that man or that woman</b> who did that evil thing to your gates, even the man or the woman, and you shall stone them until they die” (Deuteronomy 17:5), and it is inferred: <b>You take out a man or a woman to your gates</b> to judge them in the court that is located at the gates of the city, which is a lesser Sanhedrin, <b>but you do not take out an entire city to your gates; </b> rather they are to be judged by the large court. <b>Here also</b> with regard to a tribe that has sinned: <b>You take out a man or a woman to your gates, but you do not take out the entire tribe to your gates; </b> rather they are judged by a court of seventy-one. |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | “And you shall take out that man or that woman | Sanhedrin 16b:12 | § The Mishnah states that <b>a city may be designated</b> as <b>an idolatrous city</b> only in accordance with the ruling of the Great Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy-one judges. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: As the verse states</b> with regard to one who engages in idol worship: <b>“And you shall take out that man or that woman</b> who did that evil thing to your gates” (Deuteronomy 17:5), and it is inferred: <b>You take out a man or a woman to your gates</b> for the lesser Sanhedrin to judge them, <b>but you do not take out the entire city to your gates; </b> rather, they are to be judged by the Great Sanhedrin. |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | “And you shall bring forth that man or that woman | Sanhedrin 45a:3 | <b>If we say</b> that this serves to teach that they stone only <b>him, </b> the man, <b>but not her, </b> i.e., women are not punished with stoning, there is a difficulty. <b>As isn’t it written</b> explicitly: <b>“And you shall bring forth that man or that woman</b>…and stone them with stones until they die” (Deuteronomy 17:5)? <b>Rather, what</b> does the verse mean to teach when it stresses that they stone <b>“him”? </b> If he is a man, they stone just <b>him, without his clothes, but</b> if the condemned party is a woman, they stone <b>her with her clothing. R' Yehuda says: </b> The emphasis on the word <b>“him”</b> teaches that they stone him alone, i.e., <b>without his clothes, </b> but as is the case with all other punishments stated in the Torah, <b>there is no difference</b> for <b>a man and no difference</b> for <b>a woman, </b> meaning the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both men and women. |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | “Then you shall bring forth that man | Sanhedrin 60b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “And has gone and served other gods and bowed to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), <b>and</b> a verse <b>near it</b> states: <b>“Then you shall bring forth that man</b> or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them with stones and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). It is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses that one who bows down to an idol is liable to be executed. |
| Deuteronomy 17:5 | but isn’t it written: “And you shall take out that man or that woman, | Sotah 23b:10 | § The Mishnah states: <b>A man is stoned naked, </b> but a woman is not stoned naked. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Talmud answers: The verse states: <b>“And</b> let the entire congregation <b>stone him”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). <b>What</b> does the term <b>“him”</b> come to exclude? <b>If we say</b> this means that they stone <b>him but not her, </b> i.e., that a woman is not stoned at all, <b>but isn’t it written: “And you shall take out that man or that woman, </b> who did this evil thing, to your gates, that man or that woman; and you shall stone them with stones, and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). <b>Rather, </b> the term <b>“him”</b> excludes his garment, indicating that he is stoned <b>without his garment. And</b> a woman is excluded from this <i>halakha</i>, as one may infer from the term “him” that they do <b>not</b> stone <b>her without her garment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death” | Berakhot 18b:3 | In contrast to the righteous, who are referred to as living even after their death, the verse states explicitly: <b>“The dead know nothing. ” These are the wicked, who</b> even <b>during their lives are called dead, as</b> the prophet Ezekiel <b>said</b> in reference to a king of Israel who was alive: <b>“And you are a slain, wicked prince of Israel”</b> (Ezekiel 21:30). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). This is puzzling. As long as the accused has not been sentenced to death, he <b>is alive. Rather, </b> this person who is wicked is considered <b>dead from the outset. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | Abaye said to him: You say testimony? Testimony is different, as the Merciful One states: “From their mouths” | Gittin 71a:6 | <b>Abaye said to him: You say testimony? Testimony is different, as God states: “From their mouths”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), which emphasizes that testimony must come from the witnesses’ mouths <b>and not from their writing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | “At the mouth | Keritot 4a:2 | <b>R' Zeira raises an objection</b> from that which is taught in a different context. It is stated in a <i>baraita</i> that all who unwittingly transgress prohibitions punishable by death are liable to bring sin offerings, <b>except for conspiring witnesses, </b> who are not obligated to bring sin offerings, <b>as</b> their transgression <b>does not involve an action. But why</b> is that so? <b>It is written with regard to</b> such witnesses: <b>“At the mouth</b> of two witnesses” (Deuteronomy 17:6). They acted through speech, and the twisting of their lips should be considered an action, as they are liable for what they actually said, not for what was in their hearts. <b>Rava said: </b> The case of <b>conspiring witnesses is different, since their</b> transgression <b>is</b> primarily <b>through sight, </b> i.e., the important part of their testimony is what they saw, which is not an action. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he who is to die be executed” | Makkot 5b:21 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> It is written: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he who is to die be executed”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). The question is: <b>If the testimony is valid with two</b> witnesses, <b>why did the verse specify</b> that it is valid <b>with three? Rather, </b> it is <b>to juxtapose</b> and liken <b>three to two: Just as three</b> witnesses <b>can render the two</b> witnesses <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>so too, the two</b> witnesses <b>can render the three</b> witnesses <b>conspiring</b> witnesses. <b>And from where</b> is it derived that two witnesses can render <b>even one hundred</b> witnesses conspiring witnesses? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: </b> “Three <b>witnesses. ”</b> Since the verse is obviously discussing witnesses, the term witnesses is superfluous, as it could have stated: Two or three. The term “witnesses” teaches that two witnesses can render a set of witnesses conspiring witnesses irrespective of their number. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | forewarning him, as it is stated: “At the mouth of two witnesses… | Makkot 6b:2 | <b>R' Yosei says: </b> Transgressors <b>are never executed unless his two witnesses are</b> the ones <b>forewarning him, as it is stated: “At the mouth of two witnesses…</b>he who is to be put to death shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:6), from which it is derived that it is from the mouths of the two witnesses that the accused must be forewarned, and forewarning issued by someone else is insufficient. <b>Alternatively, </b> from the phrase <b>“at the mouth of two witnesses”</b> one derives <b>that</b> the judges must hear the testimony directly from the witnesses, and the <b>Sanhedrin will not hear</b> testimony <b>from the mouth of an interpreter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | as it is stated: “He shall not die at the mouth of one witness” | Makkot 6b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Zutra bar Tuvya says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to disjointed testimony, </b> in which each of the witnesses saw the incident independent of the other, <b>that it is not valid? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “He shall not die at the mouth of one witness”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). The exposition is as follows: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“one</b> witness”? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>one witness literally, we learn it from the first</b> portion of the verse: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses, ”</b> indicating that the testimony of fewer than two witnesses is not valid. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>“one</b> witness”? It means that the accused is not executed based on the testimony of people who witnessed an incident with <b>one</b> witness here and <b>one</b> witness elsewhere. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | monetary law, as it is written: “He shall not die at the mouth of one witness” | Makkot 6b:7 | <b>Rav Naḥman says: Disjointed testimony</b> of two witnesses, each of whom observed an incident independent of the other, <b>is valid in</b> cases of <b>monetary law, as it is written: “He shall not die at the mouth of one witness”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). This indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>capital law that</b> disjointed testimony <b>is not valid, but with regard to</b> cases of <b>monetary law</b> that testimony <b>is valid. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | “At the mouth of two witnesses, | Rosh Hashanah21b:13 | <b>And</b> the other <b>one said: Among the prophets there has not arisen one</b> like Moses, but <b>among the kings, one did arise, </b> Solomon, who was as wise as Moses. <b>How do I uphold</b> the words <b>“Kohelet sought to find words of delight”? Kohelet, </b> King Solomon, <b>sought to issue judgments of the heart, </b> based solely on his intuition, <b>without witnesses and without warning. </b> But <b>a bat kol issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth. ”</b> Which words is this referring to? <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses, </b> or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). Punishment can be administered only based on the testimony of two witnesses. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | shall he that is to die be put to death” | Sanhedrin 37b:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon ben Shataḥ said</b> as an oath: <b>I will</b> not <b>see the consolation</b> of Israel <b>if I did not</b> once <b>see one</b> person <b>pursue another into a ruin, and I pursued him and saw a sword in his hand, dripping</b> with <b>blood, and the one</b> who was ultimately <b>killed</b> was <b>convulsing. And I said to him: Wicked person, who has killed this man? Either you or I. But what can I do, since your blood is not given over to me, as the Torah states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, </b> or three witnesses, <b>shall he that is to die be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), and I did not witness you killing him. <b>The One Who knows</b> one’s <b>thoughts shall punish this man who killed another. </b> The rabbis <b>said: They did not move from there before a snake came and bit the</b> murderer, <b>and he died. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | the dead be put to death” | Sanhedrin 41a:9 | § The <i>baraita</i> teaches that one of the questions the court asks of the witnesses is: <b>Did he release himself to death, </b> i.e., did he acknowledge that he is aware that the court imposes capital punishment for murder? The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that he must release himself to death? <b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Ḥizkiyya</b> who said, that <b>the verse states: </b> “By the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall <b>the dead be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6). By referring to the transgressor as dead even before he is executed, the verse indicates that he is not executed <b>until he releases himself to death, </b> by stating that he is aware that he will be executed for his transgression. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | Rabbi Akiva says: | Sanhedrin 9a:3 | <b>Ravina says</b> a different explanation: The case in the Mishnah is discussing a situation <b>where one of the witnesses is found</b> to be a close <b>relative or a disqualified</b> witness, but two valid witnesses still remain. <b>And</b> R' Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between R' Yosei and R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva. As we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Makkot</i> 5b) that <b>R' Akiva says: </b> When the verse states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 17:6), <b>the 3rd</b> witness is mentioned <b>only to be stringent with him, to make his status like these</b> other two witnesses. If a group of three witnesses is found to be conspiring witnesses, the 3rd one might claim that his testimony was unnecessary and therefore did no harm. The Torah nevertheless imposes upon him the same strict punishment as his peers. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | warn him, as it is stated: “At the mouth of two witnesses, | Sanhedrin 9b:2 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The Mishnah discusses a case <b>where others warned her, and</b> the <b>witnesses</b> themselves <b>did not warn her. And</b> R' Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between R' Yosei and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Makkot</i> 6b), <b>R' Yosei says: </b> A defendant is <b>never executed unless the mouths of his two witnesses</b> are those who <b>warn him, as it is stated: “At the mouth of two witnesses, </b> or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). The verse’s emphasis on the phrase “at the mouth of” teaches that the witnesses must issue the warning themselves. R' Meir may agree with R' Yosei that the woman cannot be executed if others gave the warning. Therefore the trial of the defamer needs only three judges, whereas the Rabbis in the Mishnah agree with the Rabbis in <i>Makkot</i> who disagree with R' Yosei. Since she may be tried for adultery, the case requires twenty-three judges. |
| Deuteronomy 17:6 | as the Torah says: “On the basis of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is to die be put to death” | Shevuot 34a:19 | <b>But what can I do, as your blood is not given to my control</b> and I have no jurisdiction to execute you, <b>as the Torah says: “On the basis of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is to die be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), and there are no witnesses here. <b>Rather, God will exact retribution from you. </b> The rabbis <b>said: They did not move from there until a snake came and bit</b> the pursuer <b>and he died. </b> R' Aḥa would hold in that case that the pursuer could be executed by the court based on circumstantial evidence. Ostensibly, R' Yosei HaGelili disagrees, as he says that testimony based on knowledge without sight exists only in cases of monetary law. |
| Deuteronomy 17:7 | as it is stated: “The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people” | Sanhedrin 45a:11 | <b>And if</b> the condemned man does <b>not</b> die from his fall, <b>the second</b> witness <b>takes the stone</b> that has been prepared for this task <b>and places, </b> i.e., casts, <b>it on his chest. </b> And <b>if he dies with</b> the casting of <b>this</b> first stone, the obligation to stone the transgressor <b>is fulfilled. And if</b> he does <b>not</b> die with the casting of this stone, then <b>his stoning</b> is completed <b>by all of the Jewish people, </b> i.e., by all the people who assembled for the execution, <b>as it is stated: “The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:7). |
| Deuteronomy 17:7 | “The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death” | Sanhedrin 45b:7 | § <b>Shmuel says: </b> If <b>the witnesses’ hands were severed</b> after the transgressor was sentenced to be stoned, so that they can no longer stone him themselves, the transgressor is <b>exempt</b> from punishment and is not executed. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? This is <b>because I need</b> to fulfill what is stated in the verse: <b>“The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:7), <b>and</b> here this is <b>not</b> possible. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | “And you shall arise and go up to the place that the Lord, your God, shall choose” | Kiddushin 69a:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches: There were <b>ten</b> categories of <b>lineage</b> among the Jews who <b>ascended from Babylonia. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> the phrase: <b>Ascended from Babylonia? </b> Why was it important for the <i>tanna</i> to specify their place of origin? <b>Let him teach</b> that they <b>went to Eretz Yisrael. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>He teaches us a matter in passing, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall arise and go up to the place that YHWH, your God, shall choose”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the Temple is higher than all of Eretz Yisrael, </b> which is why the verse speaks of ascending from the cities of Eretz Yisrael to the Temple. <b>And</b> it teaches that <b>Eretz Yisrael is higher than all of the lands. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | “Matters of controversy within your gates, and you shall arise and go up | Kiddushin 69b:1 | <b>“Matters of controversy within your gates, and you shall arise and go up</b> to the place that YHWH, your God, shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8), indicating that the Temple, the place that God chose, is higher than all other cities in Eretz Yisrael. <b>But from where do we</b> derive the claim <b>that Eretz Yisrael is higher than all</b> other <b>lands? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “Therefore behold, the days are coming, says YHWH, when they shall no more say: As YHWH lives, Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but: As YHWH lives, Who brought up and Who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them”</b> (Jeremiah 23:7–8). The phrase “Who brought up” indicates that Eretz Yisrael is higher than all the other lands from where God will bring the Jewish people. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | “If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, | Niddah 19a:7 | <b>R' Ḥama bar Yosef says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: </b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to those who come before the court: <b>“If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, </b> between plea and plea, and between leprous mark and leprous mark, even matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and get up unto the place that YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). When the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means <b>between pure blood and impure blood, </b> which demonstrates that there must be types of pure blood that are emitted by a woman. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | the verse states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place | Sanhedrin 14b:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the case of a rebellious elder, a Sage who publicly teaches a <i>halakha</i> against the ruling of the Great Sanhedrin: If the rebellious elder <b>found</b> the members of the Sanhedrin <b>in Beit Pagei</b> outside of Jerusalem <b>and rebelled against them</b> by rejecting their decision, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>his rebellion</b> is deemed <b>a rebellion</b> and he will be liable to receive the death penalty if he instructs the public to follow his opinion. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place</b> that YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8), and this <b>teaches that the location determines</b> the authority of the Sanhedrin; to a certain extent this authority exists only when the Sanhedrin is situated in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, adjacent to the Temple. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | The Sages taught | Sanhedrin 86b:20 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to that which is stated: “If there shall be a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between mark and mark, even matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and ascend to the place that YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). <b>“If there shall be a matter too hard [<i>yippaleh</i>] for you”; </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | “If there shall be a matter too hard for you in judgment” | Sanhedrin 87a:7 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Meir? He derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>matter</b> written here and the term <b>matter</b> that is written elsewhere. <b>Here, </b> matter <b>is written</b> in the verse: <b>“If there shall be a matter too hard for you in judgment”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8), <b>and there, it is written: “And the matter shall be concealed from the eyes of the assembly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as there, </b> in the verse in Leviticus, the sin-offering of the congregation is brought only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here, </b> the rebellious elder is liable only for <b>a matter</b> for <b>whose intentional</b> violation one is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for <b>whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place” | Sotah 45a:5 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a rebellious Elder found</b> the Sanhedrin not in the Hewn Chamber, which was their usual place, but <b>in Beit Pagei, </b> near Jerusalem, <b>and he rebelled against them</b> there, by teaching in opposition to their ruling, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>his rebellion should be</b> considered <b>a rebellion, </b> rendering him liable to punishment. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8), which <b>teaches that</b> it is <b>the place</b> where the Sanhedrin resides that <b>causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | “And you shall arise and go up to the place” | Sotah 45a:9 | It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef, </b> that R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov disagrees even with regard to the number of judges: If the rebellious Elder <b>found</b> the Sanhedrin <b>in Beit Pagei and rebelled against them, for example, if they went out for the measurement</b> of the ritual <b>of the heifer or to expand</b> the area of <b>the city or</b> that of <b>the courtyards, </b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>his rebellion should be a rebellion. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the requirement to follow the rulings of the Sanhedrin: <b>“And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the place causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect, indicating that the entire Sanhedrin participates in the measurement of the distance from the corpse to the cities. |
| Deuteronomy 17:8 | said: It is written: “Then you shall arise, and get you up unto the place | Zevachim 54b:4 | David and Samuel <b>said: It is written: “Then you shall arise, and get you up unto the place</b> which YHWH your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the Temple is higher than all</b> places in <b>Eretz Yisrael. And Eretz Yisrael is higher than all countries. They did not know where</b> the highest <b>place</b> in Eretz Yisrael was. |
| Deuteronomy 17:9 | says: “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days” | Rosh Hashanah25b:3 | <b>And it</b> further <b>says: “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9). <b>But</b> can it <b>enter your mind that a person</b> can <b>go to a judge that is not</b> alive <b>in his days? </b> What, then, is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? It teaches that <b>you</b> need <b>to go only to the judge in one’s days, </b> i.e., he is authorized to judge and decide matters. <b>And it</b> also <b>says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these? </b> For it is not out of wisdom that you inquire concerning this” (Ecclesiastes 7:10). Instead, one must accept the rulings of the leaders of his generation. |
| Deuteronomy 17:9 | as it is written: “And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge | Sanhedrin 14b:2 | § The Talmud comments: <b>The Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> With regard to the breaking of the neck of the heifer, the verse states: <b>“And your elders and your judges shall go out”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:2). <b>“Your elders, ” this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanhedrin; “and your judges, ” this</b> is referring to the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest. </b> The <i>baraita</i> explains the assertion that the <b>king</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written: “The king by justice establishes the land”</b> (Proverbs 29:4), and the <b>High Priest</b> is also called a judge, <b>as it is written: “And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge</b> that will be in those days” (Deuteronomy 17:9), referring to the High Priest. |
| Deuteronomy 17:9 | “And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who will be in those days” | Sanhedrin 28b:26 | <b>There are those who teach</b> this ruling <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei HaGelili interpreted this</b> verse: <b>“And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who will be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9). R' Yosei HaGelili asks: What is the meaning of the phrase “who will be in those days”? <b>But will</b> it <b>enter your mind that a person</b> would <b>go to a judge that was not in his days? Rather, this</b> is referring to one <b>who was a relative</b> of one of the litigants due to marriage, <b>and</b> then <b>became not related. </b> The litigant can therefore come before him only in those days that they are not related, and not while they are still related. |
| Deuteronomy 17:9 | “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge that will be in those days” | Sanhedrin 52b:3 | <b>Rav Yosef says: </b> Rav Ḥama bar Toviyya <b>erred with regard to two</b> <i>halakhot</i>. <b>He erred with regard to</b> the ruling <b>of Rav Mattana, </b> i.e., that burning is performed using a wick of lead, <b>and he erred with regard to that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge that will be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9), that <b>at a time when there is a priest</b> serving in the Temple, i.e., when the Temple is built, <b>there is judgment</b> of capital cases. By inference, <b>at a time when there is no priest, there is no judgment</b> of capital cases. |
| Deuteronomy 17:10 | As it is written: “And you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall declare to you from that place” | Avodah Zarah8b:18 | The Talmud explains why a court may not adjudicate capital cases once the Sanhedrin has left the Chamber of Hewn Stone. <b>As it is written: “And you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall declare to you from that place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:10). This verse <b>teaches that</b> it is <b>the place</b> where the Sanhedrin resides that <b>causes</b> the judgment to take place. In other words, if the Sanhedrin has abandoned its proper place, the Chamber of Hewn Stone, all courts must cease judging capital cases. |
| Deuteronomy 17:10 | rebellion. | Sanhedrin 16a:8 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But when presumptuousness is written</b> with regard to a rebellious elder, <b>it is written with regard to</b> the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>and a death</b> sentence may <b>be</b> issued <b>by</b> a court of <b>twenty-three</b> judges. <b>Rather, Reish Lakish said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy, with the meaning of the term <b>word</b> stated in the context of a false prophet learned <b>from</b> the term <b>word, </b> used when describing the rebellious elder’s <b>rebellion. </b> The rebellious elder transgresses by violating the mitzva: “And you shall do according to the word that they will tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:10), and with regard to the false prophet the verse states: “Who shall speak a word presumptuously in My name” (Deuteronomy 18:20). Just as the rebellious elder rebels against a court of seventy-one judges, so too, a false prophet who speaks a word that is not in the name of God is sentenced to death by a court of seventy-one judges. |
| Deuteronomy 17:10 | from that place that the Lord shall choose | Sanhedrin 86b:18 | <b>And if not, these</b> judges <b>and those</b> judges <b>come to the High Court, </b> the Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges <b>that is in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, from which Torah emerges to the entire Jewish people, as it is stated: </b> “And you shall do according to the matter that they shall declare unto you <b>from that place that YHWH shall choose</b> and you shall observe to perform according to all that they shall teach you” (Deuteronomy 17:10). They are the ultimate arbiters who establish the <i>halakha</i> that is binding. If they ruled contrary to the ruling of the elder and the elder then <b>returned to his city, </b> and nevertheless, <b>he taught in the manner that he was teaching</b> previously, he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment. <b>But if he instructed</b> others <b>to act</b> on the basis of his ruling that stands contrary to the ruling of the Sanhedrin, he is <b>liable</b> to be executed, <b>as it is stated: “And the man that shall do so intentionally</b> not to listen” (Deuteronomy 17:12), meaning that <b>one is not liable unless he instructs</b> others <b>to act. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:10 | “That they shall declare unto you from that place” | Sanhedrin 87a:9 | <b>And</b> what is the reason for the opinion of <b>R' Shimon? </b> It is as it is written with regard to the rebellious elder: <b>“That they shall declare unto you from that place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:10), from which R' Shimon derives that one is liable <b>even</b> if he deviates from the ruling of the Sanhedrin to any degree <b>whatsoever. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | you shall not deviate | Berakhot 19b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why? Let us</b> also <b>say</b> here: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against YHWH. ” Rav bar Shaba interpreted this</b> prohibition, which is overridden by human dignity, <b>before Rav Kahana</b> as referring <b>to the prohibition of: </b> “According to the Torah taught to you and the ruling handed down to you, you shall do, <b>you shall not deviate</b> to the left or the right from that which they tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). The Yeshiva students <b>laughed at him, </b> as the <b>prohibition of “you shall not deviate” is by Torah law, </b> like all other Torah prohibitions. Why should human dignity override it any more than any other Torah prohibition? |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | “According to the Torah, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment, | Megillah 20b:17 | <b>And</b> with regard <b>to giving the <i>sota</i> to drink</b> from the bitter waters, this <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“Torah”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“Torah. ” It is written here</b> with respect to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this Torah”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to judgment: <b>“According to the Torah, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment, </b> which they shall tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate | Menachot 38a:1 | He stated this <b>with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate</b> to the left or the right of that which they tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). A prohibition by rabbinic law is overridden by human dignity, but not a prohibition by Torah law. Therefore, Mar bar Rav Ashi would have removed his garment had he known about the tear. |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | “According to the Torah that they shall instruct you” | Sanhedrin 87a:8 | <b>And</b> what is the reason for the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda? </b> It is as it is written with regard to the rebellious elder: <b>“According to the Torah that they shall instruct you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:11), indicating that there is no liability <b>until it is</b> a matter that consists of elements of both the Written <b>Torah and</b> in that the rabbis <b>shall instruct you</b> in interpretation of the Written Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | You shall not turn aside | Shabbat 23a:7 | And <b>what blessing</b> does one <b>recite? He recites: Who has made us holy through His commandments and has commanded us to light the Hanukkah light. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And where did He command us? </b> The mitzva of Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Torah, so how is it possible to say that it was commanded to us by God? The Talmud answers that <b>Rav Avya said: </b> The obligation to recite this blessing is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “<b>You shall not turn aside</b> from the sentence which they shall declare unto you, to the right, nor to the left” (Deuteronomy 17:11). From this verse, the mitzva incumbent upon all of Israel to heed the statements and decrees of the rabbis is derived. Therefore, one who fulfills their directives fulfills a divine commandment. <b>Rav Neḥemya said</b> that the mitzva to heed the voice of the Elders of Israel is derived from the verse: <b>“Ask your father, and he will declare unto you, your Elders, and they will tell you”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:7). |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah: | Shabbat 94b:2 | The Talmud relates: There was <b>a corpse in</b> the city of <b>Derokera</b> and <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak permitted carrying it out into a <i>karmelit</i></b> on Shabbat because, for some reason, it could not remain where it was. <b>R' Yoḥanan, brother of Mar, son</b> of <b>Rabbana, said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: In accordance with whose</b> opinion did you permit moving the corpse to the <i>karmelit</i>? If it was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Shimon, say that</b> in that case <b>R' Shimon exempted</b> one <b>from</b> the <b>obligation</b> to bring a <b>sin-offering. </b> However, <b>there</b> remains <b>a rabbinic prohibition. </b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: By God, have you entered into</b> an understanding of the matter? <b>Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda it is permitted</b> to carry out the corpse, <b>as did I say</b> they may carry it out <b>to the public domain? I said</b> that it may be carried out <b>into a <i>karmelit</i>, </b> which is only prohibited by rabbinic law. With regard to prohibitions by rabbinic law, the principle states: <b>Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah: </b> “You shall not deviate from that which they tell you to the right or to the left” (Deuteronomy 17:11). |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | “According to the law, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment, | Sotah 17b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rava says: A scroll of a <i>sota</i> that one wrote at night is unfit. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“law”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“law. ” It is written here, </b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this law”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to judgment: <b>“According to the law, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment, </b> which they shall tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). <b>Just as judgment</b> may be done only <b>by day, so too the scroll of a <i>sota</i></b> may be written only <b>by day. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | “According to the law [ tora ] that they shall teach you” | Sotah 7b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks concerning the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>sota</i> is brought before the Sanhedrin: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Gamda says</b> that <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says: </b> This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the words <b>“<i>tora</i>”</b> and <b>“<i>tora</i>. ”</b> It <b>is written here, </b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this law [<i>tora</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there, </b> with regard to a rebellious Elder, who must go to the place chosen by God and follow the ruling of the Sanhedrin: <b>“According to the law [<i>tora</i>] that they shall teach you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:11). <b>Just as there</b> the verse is referring to what occurs <b>in</b> the presence of the Sanhedrin of <b>seventy-one</b> judges, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the verse is referring to what occurs <b>in</b> the presence of the Sanhedrin of <b>seventy-one</b> judges. |
| Deuteronomy 17:11 | “You shall not turn aside | Sukkah 46a:9 | The Talmud asks: And <b>what</b> is the first <b>blessing</b> that one <b>recites? </b> He recites: <b>Blessed…Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and has commanded us to light the Hanukkah light. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And where did He command us? </b> The mitzva of Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Torah, so how can one say that it was commanded to us by God? The Talmud answers: The obligation to recite this blessing is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not turn aside</b> from the sentence which they shall declare unto you, to the right, nor to the left” (Deuteronomy 17:11). From this verse, the mitzva incumbent upon all Jews to heed the statements and decrees of the rabbis is derived. Therefore, one who fulfills their directives fulfills a mitzva by Torah law. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the mitzva to heed the voice of the Elders is derived from the verse: <b>“Ask your father, and he will declare unto you, </b> your Elders, and they will tell you” (Deuteronomy 32:7). |
| Deuteronomy 17:12 | as it is stated: “And the man that shall do so intentionally | Sanhedrin 86b:18 | <b>And if not, these</b> judges <b>and those</b> judges <b>come to the High Court, </b> the Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges <b>that is in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, from which Torah emerges to the entire Jewish people, as it is stated: </b> “And you shall do according to the matter that they shall declare unto you <b>from that place that YHWH shall choose</b> and you shall observe to perform according to all that they shall teach you” (Deuteronomy 17:10). They are the ultimate arbiters who establish the <i>halakha</i> that is binding. If they ruled contrary to the ruling of the elder and the elder then <b>returned to his city, </b> and nevertheless, <b>he taught in the manner that he was teaching</b> previously, he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment. <b>But if he instructed</b> others <b>to act</b> on the basis of his ruling that stands contrary to the ruling of the Sanhedrin, he is <b>liable</b> to be executed, <b>as it is stated: “And the man that shall do so intentionally</b> not to listen” (Deuteronomy 17:12), meaning that <b>one is not liable unless he instructs</b> others <b>to act. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:13 | executes him during the pilgrimage Festival, as it is stated: “And all the nation shall hear, and fear, and no longer sin intentionally” | Sanhedrin 89a:3 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>One does not execute</b> the rebellious elder, <b>neither in the court that is in his city, nor in the court that is in Yavne, </b> although that was the seat of the Sanhedrin after the destruction of the Second Temple. <b>Rather, one takes him up to the High Court in Jerusalem. And they guard him</b> in incarceration <b>until the pilgrimage Festival, and</b> the court <b>executes him during the pilgrimage Festival, as it is stated: “And all the nation shall hear, and fear, and no longer sin intentionally”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:13); this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. R' Yehuda says: One does not delay</b> administering <b>justice</b> to <b>this</b> individual. <b>Rather, </b> the court <b>executes him immediately, and</b> the judges <b>write</b> reports <b>and dispatch agents to all the places, </b> informing them: <b>So-and-so is liable</b> to be punished with the <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalty for disobeying the court. |
| Deuteronomy 17:13 | executes him during the pilgrimage Festival, as it is stated: “And all the nation shall hear, and fear” | Sanhedrin 89a:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:3): <b>One does not execute</b> the rebellious elder, <b>neither in the court that is in his city, nor in the court that is in Yavne. Rather, one takes him up to the High Court that is in Jerusalem. And they guard him</b> in incarceration <b>until the pilgrimage Festival, and</b> the court <b>executes him during the pilgrimage Festival, as it is stated: “And all the nation shall hear, and fear”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:13); this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:13 | it is written concerning them: “And all the nation” | Sanhedrin 89a:6 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There are <b>four</b> transgressors condemned to be executed whose verdicts <b>require a proclamation</b> to inform the public: <b>One who instigates</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>and the stubborn and rebellious son, and the rebellious elder, and conspiring witnesses. In all of these</b> cases, <b>it is written concerning them: “And all the nation”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:13), or: <b>“And all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:12, 21:21), except <b>with regard to conspiring witnesses, </b> where <b>it is written: “And those who remain</b> shall hear and fear” (Deuteronomy 19:20), <b>as not everyone is fit for</b> providing <b>testimony. </b> Therefore, rather than saying that all of the nation or all of Israel must be informed, only those remaining who are not disqualified from providing testimony are those who must heed the verse: “Hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more such evil in the midst of you” (Deuteronomy 19:20). |
| Deuteronomy 17:14 | after inheritance and settlement | Kiddushin 37b:5 | This is <b>as</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of R' Yishmael taught: Since</b> instances of <b>coming</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>are mentioned in the Torah</b> in connection to several mitzvot, <b>without specifying</b> precisely when the Jewish people are considered to have arrived there, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references that it applies only <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael, in the mitzva of appointing a king: “When you come to the land…and you inherit it and settle it” (Deuteronomy 17:14), <b>so too, wherever</b> coming to the land is mentioned without qualification, it means <b>after inheritance and settlement. </b> According to this opinion, there is no need for the verse to also mention the term dwelling. |
| Deuteronomy 17:14 | and shall say: I will set a king over me, | Sanhedrin 20b:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>R' Nehorai says: This</b> biblical <b>passage</b> about appointing a king <b>was stated only in response to</b> the Jewish people’s <b>complaint, as it is stated: </b> “When you come unto the land that YHWH your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, <b>and shall say: I will set a king over me, </b> like all the nations that are around me” (Deuteronomy 17:14). The verse indicates that appointing a king is not a mitzva and that when Samuel spoke to them, he intended to frighten them so that they might regret their complaint and retract their request for a king. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | “One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you” | Bava Batra3b:16 | Herod <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who expounds</b> the verse: <b>“One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15) as meaning that he who is appointed as king must come from a Jewish family and cannot be an emancipated slave or a convert? It is <b>the rabbis</b> who expound the verse in this manner, insisting that a king must have Jewish roots. <b>He</b> then <b>rose up and killed all the rabbis, </b> but <b>spared Bava ben Buta in order to take counsel with him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | slave should be fit for kingship, | Bava Kamma88a:5 | The Talmud raises another challenge: <b>If that is so, </b> then <b>according to the rabbis, </b> who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <b>slave should be fit for kingship, </b> as it is written: “One from among your brothers shall you set a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15). The rabbis <b>say</b> in response: <b>But according to your reasoning, </b> the <i>halakha</i> disqualifying <b>a convert</b> from being king <b>should pose a difficulty for you according to all</b> opinions, both according to the opinion of the rabbis and of R' Yehuda: Why is a convert not fit to be a king, as he is certainly in the category of brother? The Talmud answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “One from among your brothers</b> shall you set a king over you,” which indicates that the king must be <b>from the choicest among your brothers, </b> which disqualifies both converts and slaves. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | “You shall place a king over you” | Ketubot 17a:10 | The Talmud asks: The rabbis <b>praised him; </b> is that to say <b>by inference that he did well</b> in yielding? <b>But didn’t Rav Ashi say: Even</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> with regard to <b>a <i>Nasi</i> who relinquishes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him</b> that <b>his honor is relinquished, </b> i.e., he may do so, with regard to <b>a king who relinquishes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not relinquished. As the Master said</b> that the meaning of the verse <b>“You shall place a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15) is <b>that his awe shall be upon you. </b> The Torah established that the subjects’ awe is an essential component of kingship and it is not the prerogative of the king to waive it. The Talmud answers: <b>It was</b> at <b>a crossroads</b> that he encountered the wedding procession, and the fact that he yielded to the bride was not obvious to onlookers. Therefore, the honor due the king was not compromised. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | him, his honor is not forgone. As it is stated: “You shall set a king over you” | Kiddushin 32b:7 | <b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows: Rav Ashi said: Even according to the one who says</b> that if <b>a <i>Nasi</i> forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is forgone, </b> if <b>a king forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not forgone. As it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), which indicates <b>that his fear should be upon you. </b> The people are commanded to fear a king, and therefore it is not permitted for him to forgo the honor due to him. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | one from among your brothers” | Kiddushin 76b:10 | The Talmud relates: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava’s host was</b> the son of <b>a convert, and he and Rav Beivai were quarreling. One said: I</b> will <b>perform the service of the city, </b> i.e., I will be appointed to a position of authority, <b>and one said: I</b> will <b>perform the service of the city. They came before Rav Yosef</b> to decide between them. Rav Yosef <b>said to them: We learned: “You shall set him king over you, </b> whom YHWH your God shall choose; <b>one from among your brothers”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15). The repetition of the verb “set” in the verse [<i>som tasim</i>] indicates: <b>All appointments that you appoint may be only from among your brothers. </b> Therefore, a convert may not serve in any official position. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | him, his honor is not relinquished, as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you” | Sanhedrin 19b:2 | The Mishnah teaches that the king <b>does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his brother’s widow <b>and</b> his brother <b>does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with his wife, and R' Yehuda says that he may do so if he wishes. The Talmud challenges R' Yehuda’s opinion: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Ashi say: Even according to the one who says</b> that with regard to <b>a <i>Nasi</i> who relinquished</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is relinquished, </b> nevertheless, with regard to <b>a king who relinquished</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not relinquished, as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning <b>that his fear should be upon you. </b> The preservation of a king’s honor is mandated by the Torah. How could R' Yehuda allow him to waive it? The Talmud answers: <b>A mitzva is different; </b> a king is not disgraced if he relinquishes his honor to perform a mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you” | Sanhedrin 20b:6 | With regard to the king’s rights, the rabbis engaged in a dispute: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: </b> Concerning <b>all</b> the actions <b>that are stated in the</b> biblical <b>passage about</b> the <b>king</b> (see I Samuel 8:11–17), it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a king to</b> perform <b>them. Rav says: This</b> biblical <b>passage was stated only</b> in order <b>to threaten</b> the Jewish people, so that they would accept the king’s sovereignty with reverence, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning, it is necessary <b>that his fear should be upon you. </b> But the king is not actually permitted to perform the actions stated there. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you” | Sanhedrin 20b:7 | The Talmud comments that this dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, </b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says: </b> Concerning <b>all</b> the actions <b>that are stated in the</b> biblical <b>passage about</b> the <b>king, </b> it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a king to</b> perform <b>them. R' Yehuda says: This</b> biblical <b>passage was stated only</b> in order <b>to threaten</b> the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning, it is necessary <b>that his fear should be upon you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | horse, and one may not sit on his throne, and one may not use his scepter, and one may not see him when he is having his hair cut, nor when he is naked, nor when he is in the bathhouse, as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you” | Sanhedrin 22a:11 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>One may not ride on</b> the king’s <b>horse, and one may not sit on his throne, and one may not use his scepter, and one may not see him when he is having his hair cut, nor when he is naked, nor when he is in the bathhouse, as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning, ensure <b>that his fear should be upon you. </b> All of these actions would lessen one’s fear of and reverence for the king. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | “You may not appoint a foreigner over you” | Sotah 41a:17 | <b>King Agrippa arose, and received</b> the Torah scroll, <b>and read</b> from it while <b>standing, and the rabbis praised him</b> for this. <b>And when</b> Agrippa <b>arrived at</b> the verse in the portion read by the king that states: <b>“You may not appoint a foreigner over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), <b>tears flowed from his eyes, </b> because he was a descendant of the house of Herod and was not of Jewish origin. The entire nation <b>said to him: Fear not, Agrippa. You are our brother, you are our brother. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | him, his honor is not relinquished, as it is stated: “You shall place a king over you” | Sotah 41b:4 | It is stated in the Mishnah that King Agrippa read from the Torah while standing, <b>and the rabbis praised him</b> for this. The Talmud asks: <b>From the fact</b> that <b>they praised him, </b> can it be concluded <b>that he acted appropriately? Didn’t Rav Ashi say: Even according to the one who says</b> with regard to <b>a <i>Nasi</i> who relinquished</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is relinquished, </b> i.e., he may do so, with regard to <b>a king who relinquished</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not relinquished, as it is stated: “You shall place a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15). This is interpreted to mean <b>that his awe shall be upon you. </b> The Torah establishes that awe is an essential component of kingship, and it is not the prerogative of the king to relinquish it. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | “You may not appoint | Sotah 41b:6 | The Mishnah continues: <b>And when</b> Agrippa <b>arrived at</b> the verse: <b>“You may not appoint</b> a foreigner over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15), tears flowed from his eyes because he was a descendant of the house of Herod and was not of Jewish origin. The entire nation said to him: You are our brother. It is <b>taught in the name of R' Natan: At that moment the enemies of the Jewish people, </b> a euphemism for the Jewish people, <b>were sentenced to destruction for flattering Agrippa. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you, whom the Lord your God shall choose; one from among your brothers you shall set king over you” | Yevamot 102a:1 | <b>By Torah law a convert may judge his fellow</b> convert, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you, whom YHWH your God shall choose; one from among your brothers you shall set king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15). The Talmud deduces from the terminology of the phrase <b>“over you, ”</b> i.e., when presiding over Jews by birth either as a king, a judge, or any other official, that from here it <b>is where we require</b> that the official must be: <b>“From among your brothers, ”</b> meaning a Jew by birth. <b>However, a convert may judge his fellow convert, </b> as the requirement of “one from among your brothers” doesn’t apply when presiding over fellow converts. |
| Deuteronomy 17:15 | “You shall place a king over you | Yevamot 45b:9 | The Talmud cites a related <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rava ruled</b> that <b>Rav Mari bar Raḥel, </b> who was the son of a non-Jew father and a Jewish mother, was <b>fit</b> to marry into the congregation of Israel, <b>and</b> furthermore <b>he appointed him as one of the officials [<i>pursei</i>] of Babylonia. And although the Master said</b> that from the verse, <b>“You shall place a king over you</b> whom YHWH your God shall chose; from among your brethren shall you place a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15) it is derived that not only with regard to the kingship but also with regard to <b>all positions</b> of authority <b>that you appoint, </b> the incumbents <b>may be</b> selected <b>only from among your brethren</b> who share your Jewish lineage. Nevertheless, with regard to <b>this one, </b> i.e., Rav Mari bar Raḥel, <b>since his mother is of Jewish</b> lineage, <b>we call him “from among your brethren, ”</b> and so he is eligible. |
| Deuteronomy 17:16 | he shall not accumulate many horses for himself | Sanhedrin 21b:17 | <b>And it is</b> also <b>written: </b> “Only <b>he shall not accumulate many horses for himself</b> nor return the people to Egypt for the sake of accumulating horses” (Deuteronomy 17:16), <b>and Solomon said: I will accumulate many, but I will not return. And it is written: “And a chariot</b> came up <b>and went out of Egypt for six</b> hundred shekels of silver” (I Kings 10:29), teaching that not only did Solomon violate the Torah, but he also failed in applying the rationale given for its commandments. This demonstrates the wisdom in the Torah’s usual silence as to the rationale for its mitzvot, as individuals will not mistakenly rely on their own wisdom to reason that the mitzvot are inapplicable in some circumstances. |
| Deuteronomy 17:16 | “shall not accumulate many horses for himself” | Sanhedrin 21b:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The king <b>“shall not accumulate many horses for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:16), but <b>only</b> enough <b>for his chariot</b> in war and in peace. <b>“Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), but <b>only enough to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance [<i>aspanya</i>]. And</b> the king <b>writes himself a Torah scroll for his sake, </b> as stipulated in Deuteronomy 17:18. When <b>he goes out to war, he brings it out with him. </b> When <b>he comes in</b> from war, <b>he brings it in with him. </b> When <b>he sits in judgment, it is with him. </b> When <b>he reclines</b> to eat, <b>it is opposite him, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19). |
| Deuteronomy 17:16 | “He shall not accumulate many horses [ susim ] for himself | Sanhedrin 21b:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“He shall not accumulate many horses [<i>susim</i>] for himself</b> nor return the people to Egypt for the sake of accumulating horses [<i>sus</i>]” (Deuteronomy 17:16): One <b>might</b> have thought that he shall not have <b>even</b> enough horses <b>for his chariot and riders. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For himself, ”</b> teaching that only if the horses are <b>for himself, </b> for personal pleasure, <b>he shall not accumulate</b> them, <b>but he may accumulate</b> horses <b>for his chariot and riders. How, then, do I realize</b> the meaning of <b>“horses [<i>susim</i>]”</b> in the verse? It is referring to <b>idle horses, </b> which serve no purpose other than glorifying the king. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that even</b> if the king has <b>one horse that is idle, that he</b> transgresses <b>“he shall not accumulate”? The verse states: “For the sake of accumulating horses [<i>sus</i>], ”</b> with the term for horses written in the singular. |
| Deuteronomy 17:16 | this verse: “You shall henceforth return no more that way” | Sukkah 51b:8 | After depicting the glory of the synagogue, the Talmud relates that <b>Abaye said: All of</b> the people who congregated in that synagogue <b>were killed by Alexander</b> the Great <b>of Macedonia. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>they were punished</b> and killed? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they violated</b> the prohibition with regard to Egypt in <b>this verse: “You shall henceforth return no more that way”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:16), <b>and they returned. </b> Since they established their permanent place of residence in Egypt, they were punished. |
| Deuteronomy 17:17 | “And he should not multiply wives for himself, | Bava Metzia115a:12 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 21a) concerning the mitzvot of a king: <b>“And he should not multiply wives for himself, </b> that his heart not turn away” (Deuteronomy 17:17). <b>R' Yehuda says: He</b> may <b>accumulate many</b> wives <b>for himself, provided that they are not</b> like those who <b>turn his heart</b> from reverence for God. <b>R' Shimon says: Even one who turns his heart away, he should not marry her. If so, why is it stated: “He shall not multiply wives for himself”? </b> This teaches that <b>even</b> with regard to wives <b>like Abigail, </b> who was righteous and prevented David from sin (see I Samuel chapter 25), he is forbidden to have many. In this case, R' Shimon does not interpret the rationale of the verse, while R' Yehuda does interpret its rationale. |
| Deuteronomy 17:17 | “shall not add many wives for himself” | Sanhedrin 21a:3 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The king <b>“shall not add many wives for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), <b>but</b> only <b>eighteen. R' Yehuda says: He</b> may <b>add many</b> wives <b>for himself, provided that they are not</b> like those who <b>turn his heart</b> away from reverence for God. <b>R' Shimon says: Even</b> if he wants to marry only <b>one</b> wife, if <b>she turns his heart away, he should not marry her. If so, why is it stated: “He shall not add many wives for himself”? </b> This teaches <b>that even</b> if his wives are <b>like Abigail, </b> who was righteous and prevented David from sin (see I Samuel, chapter 25), it is prohibited for him to have many wives. |
| Deuteronomy 17:17 | “Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself” | Sanhedrin 21b:10 | The Mishnah teaches: <b>“Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), but <b>only enough to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance. A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the command <b>“neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself, ”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that he should not have <b>even enough to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance. </b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “For himself, ”</b> teaching that only if the silver and gold is <b>for himself, </b> for personal pleasure, <b>he shall not accumulate</b> it, <b>but he may accumulate enough</b> silver and gold <b>to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:17 | “He shall not add many wives for himself, | Sanhedrin 21b:16 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>were the rationales of Torah</b> commandments <b>not revealed? </b> It was <b>because the rationales of two verses were revealed, </b> and <b>the greatest in the world, </b> King Solomon, <b>failed in</b> those matters. <b>It is written</b> with regard to a king: <b>“He shall not add many wives for himself, </b> that his heart should not turn away” (Deuteronomy 17:17). <b>Solomon said: I will add many, but I will not turn away, </b> as he thought that it is permitted to have many wives if one is otherwise meticulous not to stray. <b>And</b> later, <b>it is written: “For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart</b> after other gods” (I Kings 11:4). |
| Deuteronomy 17:17 | “Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself” | Sanhedrin 21b:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The king <b>“shall not accumulate many horses for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:16), but <b>only</b> enough <b>for his chariot</b> in war and in peace. <b>“Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), but <b>only enough to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance [<i>aspanya</i>]. And</b> the king <b>writes himself a Torah scroll for his sake, </b> as stipulated in Deuteronomy 17:18. When <b>he goes out to war, he brings it out with him. </b> When <b>he comes in</b> from war, <b>he brings it in with him. </b> When <b>he sits in judgment, it is with him. </b> When <b>he reclines</b> to eat, <b>it is opposite him, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19). |
| Deuteronomy 17:18 | “That he shall write for himself a second | Sanhedrin 21b:20 | The Talmud dismisses Abaye’s objection: <b>No, </b> the ruling of that <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> to teach that the king is commanded to write <b>two Torah</b> scrolls; he writes one scroll as does any Jew, and he writes an additional scroll because he is king. <b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That he shall write for himself a second</b> Torah in a scroll, out of that which is before the priests the Levites” (Deuteronomy 17:18). This teaches that <b>he writes for his sake two Torah</b> scrolls, <b>one that goes out and comes in with him</b> at all times, <b>and one that is placed in his treasury. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:18 | And it is written: “That he shall write for himself a second [ mishne ] Torah” | Sanhedrin 22a:1 | <b>“And the writing of the letter [<i>hannishtevan</i>] was written in the Aramaic script, and set forth in the Aramaic tongue”</b> (Ezra 4:7). The term “<i>hannishtevan</i>” is similar to the word <i>nishtana</i>, meaning changed, alluding to the fact that the script had been changed. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to the writing on the wall of Belshazzar’s palace: <b>“Then came in all the king’s wise men. But they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation”</b> (Daniel 5:8), and the reason they could not read it is that it was written in the new script that Ezra would transmit. <b>And it is written: “That he shall write for himself a second [<i>mishne</i>] Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:18), where “second [<i>mishne</i>]” teaches that it is written in <b>a script that is apt to be changed [<i>lehishtannot</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:18 | “a second [ mishne ] Torah” | Sanhedrin 22a:6 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if the script was in fact not changed, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“a second [<i>mishne</i>] Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:18)? This serves <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>two Torah scrolls</b> that the king writes, <b>one that goes out and comes in with him, and one that is placed in his treasury. </b> With regard to <b>the one that goes out and comes in with him, he makes it</b> very small, <b>like an amulet, and he hangs</b> it <b>on his arm. As it is stated</b> by King David: <b>“I have set YHWH always before me; </b> He is at my right hand, that I shall not be moved” (Psalms 16:8). This verse alludes to the two Torah scrolls, one that is before him and one that is in his right hand. |
| Deuteronomy 17:19 | states: “That he may learn to fear the Lord his God” | Horayot 11a:20 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>Who is</b> the <b><i>nasi</i>? This is a king, </b> as it is stated: “When a <i>nasi</i> sins, and performs any one of all the mitzvot of YHWH his God that shall not be performed, unwittingly, and he is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22), referring to one who has only YHWH his God over him and no other authority. <b>A baraita states: The verse states: “<i>nasi</i>. ”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the reference is to <b>the prince of a tribe, like Naḥshon, son of Amminadab. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “And performed <b>any</b> one <b>of all the mitzvot of YHWH his God. ” Later, </b> in the passage with regard to the king, the verse <b>states: “That he may learn to fear YHWH his God”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19). |
| Deuteronomy 17:19 | He does not go into the bathhouse with it, nor into the bathroom, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read from it” | Sanhedrin 21b:21 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the one that goes out and comes in with him, he makes it</b> very small, <b>like an amulet, and he hangs</b> it <b>on his arm, as it is stated: “I have set YHWH always before me; He is at my right hand, that I shall not be moved”</b> (Psalms 16:8). This alludes to the small Torah scroll that is always on his right hand. <b>He does not go into the bathhouse with it, nor into the bathroom, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read from it”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19), meaning, it shall remain in <b>a place that is appropriate for reading from it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 17:19 | it is opposite him, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life” | Sanhedrin 21b:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The king <b>“shall not accumulate many horses for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:16), but <b>only</b> enough <b>for his chariot</b> in war and in peace. <b>“Neither shall he greatly accumulate silver and gold for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), but <b>only enough to provide</b> his <b>soldiers’ sustenance [<i>aspanya</i>]. And</b> the king <b>writes himself a Torah scroll for his sake, </b> as stipulated in Deuteronomy 17:18. When <b>he goes out to war, he brings it out with him. </b> When <b>he comes in</b> from war, <b>he brings it in with him. </b> When <b>he sits in judgment, it is with him. </b> When <b>he reclines</b> to eat, <b>it is opposite him, as it is stated: “And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:19). |
| Deuteronomy 17:20 | as it is written: “So that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, | Horayot 11b:12 | <b>The Master said: But one does not anoint a king, son of a king. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “So that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, </b> he and his sons, in the midst of Israel” (Deuteronomy 17:20). His children are mentioned in the verse in order to teach them: The kingdom <b>is an inheritance for you. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that when there is a dispute</b> with regard to succession, the king <b>requires anointing, and</b> it is <b>not</b> that <b>whenever the king wishes</b> he can <b>bequeath the kingdom to his son</b> without anointing him? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: “He and his sons, in the midst of Israel. ” When there is peace in Israel we read concerning him: “He and his sons, ” even without anointing; </b> but when there is dispute, anointing is required. |
| Deuteronomy 17:20 | in the midst of Israel” | Keritot 5b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> further taught: <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did they anoint King Solomon? Due to the dispute</b> over the throne instigated by his older brother <b>Adonijah. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> in a situation <b>where there is a dispute</b> the new king <b>requires anointing, and the</b> current <b>king cannot</b> simply <b>grant the kingship as an inheritance to whomever he desires? Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “He and his children <b>in the midst of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:20). <b>At a time when there is peace in Israel</b> the monarchy transfers smoothly to the king’s son, but not when there is a dispute. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due | Chullin 130a:16 | The Talmud responds that the <b>verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due</b> from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be an ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The verse indicates that <b>“this, ”</b> the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>yes, </b> is given to the priests, but <b>another item, </b> i.e., the breast and thigh, is <b>not</b> given to the priests from non-sacred slaughtered animals. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | “This | Chullin 130b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“This</b> shall be the priests’ due” (Deuteronomy 18:3)? The Talmud answers: The verse is necessary <b>for that which Rav Ḥisda</b> taught, <b>as Rav Ḥisda said: One who causes damage</b> to <b>gifts of the priesthood, or who consumed them</b> before they were given to the priests, is <b>exempt from</b> having <b>to pay</b> to the priest, as the verse states: “This shall be the priests’ due,” which indicates that only the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw themselves, not their replacements, are given to the priests. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | “And this shall be the priests’ due [ mishpat ]” | Chullin 130b:4 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And this shall be the priests’ due [<i>mishpat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:3), which <b>teaches that the gifts</b> given to the priests are considered <b>a judgment, </b> as <i>mishpat</i> can mean judgment. The Talmud continues: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> are the gifts a judgment? Is it <b>not with regard to extracting</b> them <b>through judges, </b> i.e., a priest may claim them in court and the court will order the individual to give the gifts to that priest? If so, the gifts are considered to be money that has claimants. The Talmud rejects this suggestion: <b>No, </b> they are a judgment <b>with regard to distributing them through judges, </b> i.e., the court dictates to the owner to which type of priests he should give the gifts. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | from them as well, | Chullin 131a:9 | Rav’s comment indicates that in his opinion there are grounds to take the gifts from Levites, but nevertheless they are not taken. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> maintain in this regard? <b>If</b> he maintains that Levites <b>are called</b> part of the <b>“people, ”</b> then <b>let one take</b> the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw <b>from them as well, </b> as the verse states: “From the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | “people.” | Chullin 131b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>other gifts of the priesthood, such as the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw, </b> the court <b>does not remove them, neither from a priest</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>priest nor from a Levite</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>Levite. </b> Rav Idi bar Avin now explains his objection: It may be inferred that the court does <b>remove</b> the gifts <b>from a Levite</b> to give <b>to a priest. Evidently, </b> Levites <b>are called</b> part of the <b>“people. ”</b> Accordingly, since the verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people” (Deuteronomy 18:3), the gifts of the priesthood may be removed from the possession of Levites. Why, then, was Rav uncertain with regard to their status? |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | As it is taught | Chullin 132a:14 | The Talmud relates that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: According to the Rabbis, a <i>koy</i> is obligated to</b> have <b>all of the gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the gifts of the priesthood: “Whether it be an ox or sheep” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Since the verse needed to state only <b>“ox, ” why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Whether it be an ox”? </b> This phrase serves <b>to include a hybrid</b> in the obligation to give the gifts of the priesthood. And since the verse needed to state only <b>“sheep, ” why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Or sheep”? </b> This phrase serves <b>to include the <i>koy</i></b> in the obligation to give the gifts. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | “From them that perform a slaughter” | Chullin 132a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer, </b> who deems the owners of a <i>koy</i> and the offspring of a hybrid exempt from giving gifts of the priesthood from these animals, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“Whether</b> it be an ox or sheep”? The Talmud responds: <b>He requires it to divide</b> between an ox and a sheep, indicating that one is obligated with regard to either animal alone. Were it not for this phrase, one might have concluded that he is obligated to give the gifts only after slaughtering both an ox and a sheep. The Talmud asks: <b>And the Rabbis, </b> who derive other <i>halakhot</i> from this phrase, <b>from where do they</b> derive <b>to divide</b> between an ox and a sheep? The Talmud responds: <b>They derive it</b> from the phrase: <b>“From them that perform a slaughter”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:3), which indicates that the obligation to give the gifts applies even to one animal. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | even a female priest. | Chullin 132a:3 | <b>The school of R' Eliezer ben Yaakov taught: </b> In general, the reference to a priest in a verse serves to exclude a priest’s daughter. But when the verse mentions <b>a priest</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood, it means to include <b>even a female priest. </b> This is because the verse mentions priests twice: “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Since each reference to a priest excludes the daughter of a priest, this verse <b>is</b> a case of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases, in this instance, the daughter of a priest. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | gifts | Chullin 132a:7 | § The Talmud cites a dispute with regard to the gifts of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The obligation to give <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies</b> even <b>to a hybrid</b> animal <b>and to</b> the animal known as <b>a <i>koy</i>. R' Eliezer says: A hybrid</b> that <b>results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a ewe is obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it, while a hybrid that results <b>from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a doe is exempt from</b> having <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it. This is because the verse states with regard to gifts of the priesthood: “Whether it be an ox or sheep” (Deuteronomy 18:3), i.e., a domesticated animal, and a doe is not a domesticated animal. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | bull. | Chullin 132b:12 | The Talmud explains: <b>There, </b> in the case dealt with in Eretz Yisrael, the gifts were <b>of a</b> large <b>bull. </b> The Torah states: “That they shall give to the priest” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The use of the term “give” indicates that the gift given should be a substantial one. Even when one limb of the large bull was divided between two priests, each received a substantial portion. This is not the case with regard to the gifts of smaller animals, where each limb is not large enough to provide two substantial portions. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | interpreted | Chullin 132b:3 | The Talmud adds: <b>Rava</b> also <b>interpreted</b> the verse in such a manner. The verse states: “This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The verse specifies that the gifts are taken <b>“from the people, ” and not from the priests. When</b> the verse <b>states: “From them that perform a slaughter, ”</b> indicating that the gifts are given by anyone who slaughters an animal, <b>you must say</b> that this teaches that <b>even a butcher</b> who is <b>a priest is included</b> in the obligation to give the gifts. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | for him | Chullin 133a:5 | § With regard to the manner in which a priest takes gifts of the priesthood from their owners, <b>Rava said: Rav Yosef examined us, </b> his students, with the following question: <b>A priest who seizes gifts</b> of the priesthood from their owners, is <b>he demonstrating fondness</b> for the <b>mitzva or is he demonstrating contempt for the mitzva? And I resolved</b> this question <b>for him</b> from the verse: “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The term <b>“that they shall give”</b> indicates that the owner should give the gifts, <b>and not that</b> a priest <b>should take them by himself. </b> Accordingly, a priest who seizes the gifts from their owners is demonstrating contempt for the mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | “That they shall give | Chullin 134b:11 | § In relation to the discussion of a case where the owner of a field takes gifts left for the poor for himself, the Talmud relates that there was <b>a certain sack of dinars that was brought to the study hall</b> to provide financial assistance for the students. <b>R' Ami rushed and acquired them. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And how can he act in this</b> manner? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood: <b>“That they shall give</b> to the priest” (Deuteronomy 18:3), and the rabbis derived from the verse that a priest should receive the gifts <b>and he should not take</b> them <b>by himself. </b> The same applies to gifts for the poor as well. The Talmud responds: <b>R' Ami too</b> did not take the gifts for himself. Rather, <b>he acquired them for the poor. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | The Sages taught | Chullin 134b:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the gifts of the priesthood: “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). <b>“The foreleg”; this is</b> the <b>right foreleg</b> of the animal. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>right foreleg, or is it only the left foreleg? The verse states: “The foreleg. ”</b> The definite article indicates that the verse is referring to the right foreleg. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | giving is written with regard to it: | Chullin 134b:8 | The Talmud responds: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different</b> in the case of <b>gifts of the priesthood, as</b> a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it: </b> “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). This teaches that one must actively give the gifts to a priest, whereas no equivalent term is written with regard to gleanings. The Talmud adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation with regard to gifts of the priesthood, one can likewise explain that the reason <b><i>teruma</i></b> must be brought to a locale where there is a priest is <b>likewise</b> due to the fact that a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it: </b> “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first sheared wool of your sheep you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), not because <i>teruma</i> renders the crop untithed. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies to cattle and to sheep, | Chullin 135a:2 | There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> (see 130a) <b>than</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the first sheared wool</b> in <b>that</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies to cattle and to sheep, </b> as it is written: “Whether it be ox or sheep, that he shall give unto the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3); and it applies <b>to numerous</b> animals <b>and to few</b> animals. <b>But</b> by contrast, the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies only to sheep</b> and not to goats and cattle, <b>and applies only to numerous</b> animals. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | and giving from the first sheared wool. | Chullin 136a:15 | <b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura</b> also <b>said: These principles</b> stated by Rava <b>are not</b> accepted, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal</b> owned by <b>partners is obligated, </b> i.e., renders its owners obligated, <b>to</b> take <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood from it, <b>and R' Ilai exempts</b> the partners from the obligation. <b>What is the reason</b> for R' Ilai’s statement? He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned in this context <b>and giving from the first sheared wool. </b> The Torah states: “He shall give” (Deuteronomy 18:3), with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, and: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool. <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to the first sheared wool, in the case of sheep owned <b>in partnership</b> the owners are <b>not</b> obligated according to R' Ilai, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, if the animal is owned <b>in partnership</b> the owners are <b>not</b> obligated. |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | and he shall give | Chullin 136a:3 | Likewise, with regard to the <b>gifts</b> to which members of the priesthood are entitled, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, R' Ilai concedes that the joint owners of an animal are obligated, <b>even though God writes: </b> “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who slaughter an animal, whether it be ox or sheep; <b>and he shall give</b> to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). |
| Deuteronomy 18:3 | is not so with regard to the gifts | Chullin 136b:14 | § The Mishnah states: There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, </b> the jaw, and the maw than in the mitzva of the first sheared wool. The Mishnah then proceeds to list a number of these stringent elements. The Talmud objects: <b>But let</b> the Mishnah <b>teach</b> that there is a more <b>stringent</b> element <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool, as</b> it <b>is in effect with regard to animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>], </b> but that <b>is not so with regard to the gifts</b> of the priesthood, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, which are not given to the priest from a <i>tereifa</i>. This is because the Torah states: “He shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3), whereas in the case of a <i>tereifa</i> the gifts are effectively not given to the priest himself but to his dog, as it is prohibited for the priest to eat them. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | become grain. | Berakhot 47b:1 | <b>“From all of that is given to you, you shall set apart</b> that which is YHWH’s <i>teruma</i>” (Numbers 18:29). God’s <i>teruma</i>, <i>teruma gedola</i>, must be taken from all of the Levites’ gifts. The Talmud asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to require <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This, </b> after it was threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that, </b> which remained on the stalk, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain. </b> The verse regarding <i>teruma gedola</i> states: “The first of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4), is given to the priest. Once it is considered grain, the right of the priest takes effect and the Levite is required to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | the first sheared | Chullin 131b:11 | The Talmud persists: One can <b>say that Ezra penalized them</b> and decreed <b>that we should not give them</b> first tithe, but <b>did he say</b> that first tithe should even be <b>taken from them</b> and given to the priests? <b>Rather, </b> explain instead that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a gift that is <b>like</b> the <b>foreleg, </b> the jaw, and the maw, <b>but</b> is <b>not</b> actually the <b>foreleg, </b> the jaw, or the maw. <b>And what is this? </b> It is <b>the first sheared</b> wool, with regard to which the verse states: “And the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). Since the verse does not state that the first fleece is taken from the “people,” even Levites are obligated to give their first shearing to the priest, and it may be removed from their possession to that end. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | giving is written with regard to it: | Chullin 134b:8 | The Talmud responds: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different</b> in the case of <b>gifts of the priesthood, as</b> a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it: </b> “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). This teaches that one must actively give the gifts to a priest, whereas no equivalent term is written with regard to gleanings. The Talmud adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation with regard to gifts of the priesthood, one can likewise explain that the reason <b><i>teruma</i></b> must be brought to a locale where there is a priest is <b>likewise</b> due to the fact that a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it: </b> “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first sheared wool of your sheep you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), not because <i>teruma</i> renders the crop untithed. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | the first sheared wool | Chullin 135a:1 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool</b> that every Jew must give to the priest, as stated in the verse: “And the first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>] shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple, </b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals. <b>But</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | of your flock, shall you give him” | Chullin 135a:20 | Therefore, the <b>verse states: </b> “The first sheared wool <b>of your flock, shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), which indicates that there should be no additional action between shearing and giving the first sheared wool to the priest. In other words, the mitzva of first sheared wool applies to a sheep <b>that is lacking only shearing and giving, </b> which <b>excludes this</b> sheep <b>that is lacking shearing, redeeming, and giving. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | “The first fruits of your grain, | Chullin 135a:23 | The Talmud answers: He <b>derives it from the beginning of</b> this <b>verse, </b> which states with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“The first fruits of your grain, </b> of your wine, and of your oil” (Deuteronomy 18:4), using the singular pronoun. This indicates that only in the case of produce owned by a Jew is one obligated to separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> with regard to that which is owned <b>in partnership</b> with <b>a non-Jew. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | the first sheared wool | Chullin 135a:24 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> why do the <b>Rabbis, </b> who derive the exemption of sheep owned in partnership with a non-Jew from the term “your flock,” not derive this from the term “your grain”? The Talmud answers that the repetition of the term “the first” with regard to the first sheared wool: “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and <b>the first sheared wool</b> of your flock, shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), is an indication that the verse <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>the</b> previous <b>matter. </b> The superfluous mention of “first” signals that the two issues discussed in this verse, which are the first fruits, i.e., <i>teruma</i>, and the first sheared wool, are two separate matters. Therefore, one cannot derive the <i>halakhot</i> of one from the other. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | enough to fashion a small garment from it, as it is stated: “Shall you give him” | Chullin 135a:5 | <b>And how much</b> of the sheared wool <b>does one give to</b> the priest? One gives him sheared wool of the <b>weight</b> of <b>five <i>sela</i> in Judea, which are</b> the equivalent of <b>ten <i>sela</i> in the Galilee, </b> as the weight of the Galilean <i>sela</i> is half that of the Judean <i>sela</i>. Furthermore, although one may give the wool to the priest without laundering it, this must be the weight of the wool once <b>laundered and not</b> when <b>sullied, </b> as is characteristic of wool when sheared. The measure that must be given to the priest is <b>enough to fashion a small garment from it, as it is stated: “Shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), indicating <b>that</b> the sheared wool <b>must contain enough for</b> a proper <b>gift. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | verse states: “Your flock” | Chullin 135a:8 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah states that the mitzva of the first sheared wool does not apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that it does <b>not</b> apply? The Talmud answers that the <b>verse states: “Your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), indicating that the mitzva applies to non-sacred animals, which belong to a private individual, <b>and not</b> to <b>a flock</b> that is <b>consecrated</b> property. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | “Your grain” | Chullin 135b:7 | § <b>Rava said</b> with regard to the dispute between the Rabbis and R' Ilai: Although <b>R' Ilai</b> holds that two partners who own a sheep are exempt from the first sheared wool, he <b>concedes</b> that jointly owned produce is obligated <b>in <i>teruma</i>. </b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“Your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), using the singular pronoun, from which one may infer that with regard to <b>yours, yes, </b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership, </b> the partners are <b>not</b> obligated. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | giving from the first sheared wool. | Chullin 136a:4 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>It is possible to say</b> that one should <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned in the context of gifts to the priesthood and <b>giving from the first sheared wool. </b> The Torah states: “He shall give,” with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, and it states: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool; <b>just as there, </b> with regard to the first sheared wool, sheep owned <b>in partnership</b> do <b>not</b> render their owners obligated, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, an animal owned <b>in partnership</b> does <b>not</b> render the owners obligated. But <b>God writes: “From those who slaughter an animal, ”</b> in the plural, indicating that even the owners of an animal owned in partnership are obligated to give the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | giving from the gifts | Chullin 136b:15 | <b>Ravina said: </b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> Mishnah? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon deems <i>tereifot</i> exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool. What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>R' Shimon? </b> The reason is that he <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from the gifts</b> of the priesthood. The Torah states: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool, and it states: “He shall give,” with regard to the gifts of the priesthood. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, one is <b>not</b> obligated to give them from <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, <b>so too, </b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool, </b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to give them from <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | giving from teruma . | Chullin 136b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>If</b> R' Shimon <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from the gifts</b> of the priesthood, let him also <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from <i>teruma</i>. </b> The Torah states: “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first sheared wool of your flock shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>, </b> produce grown <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes, </b> it is obligated, whereas produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> obligated, <b>so too</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool: In Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes, </b> it applies, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael it does <b>not</b> apply. <b>Why, </b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in the Mishnah that the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | tithe. | Chullin 136b:17 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason for</b> the ruling of <b>R' Shimon, as he derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]” from</b> the animal <b>tithe. </b> With regard to the first sheared wool, the verse states: “And the first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>], shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), and with regard to the animal tithe it states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<i>tzon</i>], whichever passes under the rod, the 10th shall be holy unto YHWH” (Leviticus 27:32). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>tithe, </b> one is <b>not</b> obligated in the case of an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, so too, </b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool, </b> one is <b>not</b> obligated in the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | written here: “The first sheared wool of your flock [ tzonekha ], shall you give him” | Chullin 137a:3 | § The Mishnah states: <b>The first sheared wool is in effect only with regard to sheep. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>shearing</b> mentioned in this context and <b>shearing</b> mentioned elsewhere. It is <b>written here: “The first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>], shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>and</b> it is <b>written there</b> that Job says concerning the needy: <b>“And he was warmed with the shearing of my sheep [<i>kevasai</i>]”</b> (Job 31:20). <b>Just as there, </b> the verse is referring specifically to the shearing of <b>sheep, </b> as the term <i>keves</i> is used only with regard to a sheep, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the first sheared wool, the verse is referring to <b>sheep, </b> despite the fact that the term <i>tzon</i> can be interpreted as referring also to goats. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | sheared | Chullin 138a:11 | The Talmud clarifies the two opinions. <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that he is <b>obligated, as</b> he <b>sheared</b> five sheep that he owned at the time of shearing, and therefore the term: “Your flock” (Deuteronomy 18:4), applies to this case. <b>R' Natan bar Hoshaya says</b> that he is <b>exempt, </b> as <b>at the time that the measure</b> of five fleeces <b>is completed, we require</b> the term <b>“your flock”</b> to apply, since the obligation takes effect at that stage, <b>and</b> in this case it does <b>not</b> apply. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | shall you give to him” | Pesachim 33a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that a worthless item cannot be designated as <i>teruma</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “The first fruits of your grain, your wine, your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, <b>shall you give to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>and not to his fire. </b> One must give the priest something that he can use for any purpose, and not something that the priest will be forced to burn as fuel. Even those who permit one to derive benefit from leavened bread during Passover agree that it may not be eaten, and therefore leavened bread cannot be consecrated as <i>teruma</i> in this case. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | first fruits | Pesachim 33b:1 | <b>he said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “The <b>first fruits</b> of your grain, your wine, your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), implying <b>that its remnants are recognizable for an Israelite, </b> as the notion of a first part indicates that there is another portion remaining which is fit to be consumed by the Israelite. <b>This</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>is excluded as there is no recognizable remnant</b> left that may be consumed by the Israelite, because it is leavened bread. Since even after this portion has been separated the remainder of the produce may not be eaten, that which was separated does not become <i>teruma</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | become grain. | Shabbat 127b:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>What did you see</b> that led you to require <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles, and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This, </b> stalks that were threshed and placed into piles, are completely processed and <b>have become grain, and that, </b> grains that have remained on the stalk, <b>have not</b> yet <b>become grain. </b> The verse states the following with regard to <i>teruma gedola</i>: “The first of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4) is given to the priest. Once it is considered grain, the rights of the priest take effect and the Levite is required to separate <i>teruma gedola. </i> |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | shall you give him” | Shabbat 25b:2 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason, without counting the number of stringencies: <b>Consecrated items are</b> more <b>stringent because</b> one who eats them while ritually impure is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>, </b> while in the case of <i>teruma</i> the punishment is death at the hand of Heaven. In this regard, the Torah is more stringent vis-à-vis consecrated items than it is vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is a different proof that one is permitted to benefit from <i>teruma</i> while it is burning. As <b>the verse said: </b> “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep <b>shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4). The rabbis derived from this verse: Give the priest <i>teruma</i> that is ritually pure, that is fit for <b>him</b> to consume, <b>and</b> do <b>not</b> give the priest <i>teruma</i> that is suitable only <b>for his fire, </b> to be burned. <b>By inference, </b> ritually impure <i>teruma</i> <b>is suitable for his fire, </b> i.e., a priest may derive benefit from it. |
| Deuteronomy 18:4 | it is included in the category of grain, | Temurah 5b:18 | Rav Pappa asked: <b>What did you see</b> that leads you <b>to include</b> the first tithe taken from <b>the pile</b> in the category: “All that is given,” <b>and to exclude</b> that which is taken from <b>the stalks? </b> Abaye answered: <b>I include</b> a tithe taken from <b>the pile, as</b> it has been processed to the point where <b>it is included in the category of grain, </b> since it is written: “The first fruits of your grain…you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4); <b>and I exclude</b> a tithe taken from <b>the stalks, as</b> it <b>is not included in the category of grain</b> and is not yet obligated in <i>teruma</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | to stand to serve | Chullin 137a:9 | <b>Rather, </b> the Talmud provides a different source for the Mishnah’s statement. The reason that the mitzva of first sheared wool applies only to sheep is <b>as R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> It is stated in the verse following the source for the mitzva of first sheared wool: “For YHWH your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to serve</b> in the name of YHWH, he and his sons forever” (Deuteronomy 18:5). The term “to serve” indicates that the first sheared wool that is given to the priest must consist of <b>a matter fit for</b> the Temple <b>service, </b> i.e., its size must be large enough for use for the priestly garments. <b>Here too, </b> the first sheared wool must be of <b>a matter fit for</b> Temple <b>service, </b> i.e., sheep’s wool, from which the priestly garments are woven. |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | to stand to serve | Chullin 138a:4 | The Mishnah states: The measure that must be given to the priest is <b>enough to fashion a small garment</b> from it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> The <b>verse</b> that follows the mention of the first sheared wool <b>states: </b> “For YHWH your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to serve</b> in the name of YHWH, he and his sons forever” (Deuteronomy 18:5). The term “to serve” indicates that the first sheared wool given to the priest must be <b>a matter that is fitting for service</b> in the Temple, i.e., an amount of wool sufficient to fashion one of the priestly garments. <b>What is</b> the garment in question? It is the <b>belt, </b> which is made from wool weighing five <i>sela</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | he and his sons” | Chullin 138a:7 | The Talmud answers that the <b>verse states: </b> “To stand to serve in the name of YHWH, <b>he and his sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5), which indicates that the verse is referring to <b>a matter, </b> i.e., a garment, <b>that is equal for Aaron and for his sons. </b> The wool given to the priest must be of sufficient size for fashioning a garment worn both by the High Priest and by common priests, whereas the woolen cap is worn only by the High Priest. |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | Rav Naḥman says: The verse states: “For him has the Lord chosen from among all your tribes, to stand and minister | Sanhedrin 84a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> it is prohibited for a priest who is <b>seated</b> to perform the Temple service? <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: The verse states: “For him has YHWH chosen from among all your tribes, to stand and minister</b> in the name of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 18:5). God states in the verse that <b>I chose him for</b> service while he is <b>standing, but not for</b> service while <b>seated. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | As it is written: “To stand to minister | Sotah 38a:5 | <b>R' Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this from a verbal analogy, as <b>it says</b> in the verse: “At that time YHWH separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, to stand before YHWH <b>to minister to Him and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8). <b>Just as</b> a priest <b>performs the</b> Temple <b>service while standing, so too, he blesses while standing. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>he performs the service itself</b> while standing? <b>As it is written: “To stand to minister</b> in the name of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 18:5). |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | him and his sons forever” | Sotah 38a:8 | <b>R' Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive from a verbal analogy that the Priestly Benediction is recited with lifted hands, as <b>it says</b> with regard to Aaron: “To stand to minister in the name of YHWH, <b>him and his sons forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5). In this verse, <b>his sons are juxtaposed with him. Just as</b> Aaron recited the Priestly Benediction <b>with lifted hands, so too, his sons</b> recite the benediction <b>with lifted hands. And</b> furthermore, <b>it is written “forever, ”</b> which indicates that it is referring not only to special occasions. <b>And</b> although the verse is not referring to the Priestly Benediction, the <b>benediction is juxtaposed to</b> the Temple <b>service</b> in another verse: “To minister to Him and to bless in His name” (Deuteronomy 10:8). |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | standing, | Zevachim 19b:15 | <b>Rav Samma, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina: And let him sit and sanctify</b> his hands and feet while seated, and in this manner he may sanctify them all at once. Ravina said to him: <b>The verse states: </b> “When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar <b>to minister”</b> (Exodus 30:20), <b>and ministration is</b> performed while <b>standing, </b> as the verse states: “To stand to minister” (Deuteronomy 18:5). Therefore, sanctification must also be performed while standing. |
| Deuteronomy 18:5 | to stand to minister” | Zevachim 23b:8 | § The Mishnah teaches that a priest who is <b>sitting</b> disqualifies the rites that he performs. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: The verse states</b> with regard to the priests: “For YHWH your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to minister”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5). The verse indicates that <b>I have chosen him for standing and not for sitting. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:7 | “Then he shall serve with the name of the Lord his God” | Arakhin 11a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>basic</b> requirement to accompany communal offerings with <b>song</b> applies <b>by Torah law? As it is stated</b> with regard to a Levite who serves in the Temple: <b>“Then he shall serve with the name of YHWH his God”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:7). <b>What is</b> this <b>service</b> that is performed <b>with the name</b> of God? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>song, </b> in which the Levites mention and praise the name of God. |
| Deuteronomy 18:7 | who stand | Zevachim 23b:9 | <b>A baraita states: “To stand to minister, ”</b> indicates that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to perform the service while standing. <b>When it says: </b> “Then he shall minister in the name of YHWH his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, <b>who stand</b> there before YHWH” (Deuteronomy 18:7), <b>the verse repeats</b> the matter <b>to invalidate</b> rites that are performed while not standing. |
| Deuteronomy 18:8 | The verse states: “They shall have like portions to eat” | Sukkah 56a:1 | <b>The verse states: “They shall have like portions to eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:8); just <b>as</b> all the watches receive an equal <b>portion of the service, so too</b> all the watches receive an equal <b>portion</b> in the <b>eating. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>eating</b> mentioned in this verse? <b>If you say</b> it is the eating of <b>offerings, </b> the verse is superfluous, as it is <b>derived from there: </b> “And every meal-offering…<b>shall be the priest’s that offers it”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), which, although it was written with regard to meal-offerings, applies to all offerings. Moreover, it teaches that a priest who participates in the sacrifice of the offering shares in eating the offering. <b>Rather, </b> the verse is referring to <b>the shewbread</b> that was not part of the service this Shabbat, as it was baked the previous Shabbat. |
| Deuteronomy 18:8 | the verse states: “Besides the transactions of their fathers’ houses” | Sukkah 56a:2 | One <b>might</b> have thought that all the watches should be equal <b>even with regard to obligations that come not due to the Festival</b> but are brought <b>on the Festival</b> nevertheless, as there were many vow-offerings and free-will offerings brought to the Temple that were not part of the Festival rite, but simply the result of people taking advantage of their presence in Jerusalem to fulfill their outstanding obligations. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Besides the transactions of their fathers’ houses”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:8). <b>What did the forefathers</b> of each watch <b>sell each other? </b> They agreed with regard to the service of the watches: <b>I</b> will serve <b>during my week, and you</b> will serve <b>during your week. </b> Each watch has the right to perform the Temple service during its appointed weeks and to receive all priestly gifts offered during those weeks. |
| Deuteronomy 18:9 | “You shall not learn to do” | Avodah Zarah18a:2 | The Talmud answers: R' Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>did it to teach himself, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against sorcery: <b>“You shall not learn to do”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:9); this indicates: <b>But you may learn to understand and to teach. </b> In other words, certain prohibitions do not apply when one is acting only in order to acquire knowledge of the subject. |
| Deuteronomy 18:9 | “You shall not learn to do | Avodah Zarah43b:15 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> there is yet another answer: Fashioning figures in order <b>to teach oneself is different, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall not learn to do</b> like the abominations of those nations” (Deuteronomy 18:9): <b>But you may learn</b> in order <b>to understand</b> the matter yourself <b>and teach</b> it to others. In other words, it is permitted to perform certain acts for the sake of Torah study that would otherwise be prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 18:9 | it is written: “You shall not learn to do | Rosh Hashanah24b:13 | The Talmud suggests yet another answer: <b>If you wish, say: </b> Rabban Gamliel <b>did</b> this <b>to teach himself, </b> which is not prohibited, as <b>it is written: “You shall not learn to do</b> after the abominations of those nations” (Deuteronomy 18:9), which indicates: <b>However, you may learn to understand and to teach. </b> In other words, it is permitted to do certain things for the sake of Torah study which would otherwise be prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 18:10 | The verse states: “There shall not be found among you | Sanhedrin 64b:14 | <b>Ulla says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Elazar ben Shimon, </b> who deems one who passes himself over to Molekh liable? <b>The verse states: “There shall not be found among you</b> one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire” (Deuteronomy 18:10), and the term <b>“among you”</b> is interpreted homiletically to mean: <b>Among yourself. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:10 | “There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire” | Sanhedrin 64b:3 | If one <b>handed over</b> his child <b>and passed</b> him <b>over to the</b> priests of <b>Molekh, but</b> he did <b>not</b> pass him <b>through the fire, </b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable. It is stated here, </b> in the verse: <b>“To pass, ” and it is stated there, </b> in another verse: <b>“There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:10). <b>Just as there, </b> the verse is referring to passing one’s child <b>through the fire, so too here, </b> the reference is to passing one’s child <b>through the fire. And just as here, </b> the verse is referring to one who passes his child over to the priests of <b>Molekh, so too there, </b> the reference is to <b>Molekh</b> alone, excluding any other object of idol worship. |
| Deuteronomy 18:10 | soothsayer | Sanhedrin 65b:19 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> What is the definition of the <b>soothsayer</b> mentioned in the verse: “There shall not be found among you…a soothsayer” (Deuteronomy 18:10)? <b>R' Shimon says: This is one who applies seven types of semen [<i>zekhur</i>] to</b> one’s <b>eye</b> in order to perform sorcery. <b>And the Rabbis say: This is one who deceives the eyes, </b> as though he is performing sorcery. <b>R' Akiva says: This is one who calculates</b> the fortune of <b>times and hours, and says, </b> for example: <b>Today is</b> a <b>propitious</b> day <b>for going away</b> on a journey; <b>tomorrow is propitious for purchasing</b> property successfully. Or he says that <b>on the eve of the Sabbatical</b> Years, the <b>wheat</b> harvest <b>is generally good; uprooting legumes</b> rather than cutting them from above the ground prevents them <b>from going bad. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:10 | enchanter | Sanhedrin 65b:20 | <b>A baraita states: </b> The <b>enchanter</b> mentioned in the verse (Deuteronomy 18:10) <b>is</b> one who relies on superstitious signs, e.g., <b>one who says: </b> If one’s <b>bread fell from his mouth, </b> that is a bad sign for him; or: If one’s <b>staff fell from his hand, </b> it is a bad sign; or: If one’s <b>son calls him from behind, </b> it is a sign that he should return from his journey; or: If <b>a raven calls to him, </b> or if <b>a deer blocks him on the way, </b> or if <b>a snake is to his right, or</b> if <b>a fox is to his left, </b> all of these are bad signs. An enchanter is one who relies on these as bad signs and consequently changes his course of action. |
| Deuteronomy 18:11 | a ḥover ḥever , | Keritot 3b:28 | <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, </b> one who gathers together, which is stated in the Torah as a separate prohibition (Deuteronomy 18:11) and which is a prohibition that does not carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>. Rava <b>said to him: </b> It is true that such an individual is also a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, but <b>the Torah stated: A <i>ḥover ḥever</i> such as this, </b> who gathers demons together, is included in the category of a necromancer and therefore his punishment is death <b>by stoning, </b> and transgressing this prohibition also results in <i>karet</i>. Abaye inquired: <b>But</b> then the case of <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, which</b> is <b>a prohibition</b> that does not entail <i>karet</i>, <b>what</b> is <b>it? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:11 | “And a ḥover ḥaver ” | Keritot 3b:29 | Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And a <i>ḥover ḥaver</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:11), this is referring to both <b>one</b> who uses sorcery and thereby <b>gathers large</b> beasts into one place, <b>and</b> also to <b>one</b> who <b>gathers small</b> beasts into one place, <b>and even</b> to one who <b>gathers</b> into one place <b>snakes and scorpions; </b> all of these individuals are <b>liable. </b> With regard to this prohibition <b>Abaye says: </b> In the case of <b>this one, who</b> through sorcery <b>wants to gather</b> together <b>a hornet and a scorpion, </b> this is <b>prohibited. But if they are pursuing him</b> and he merely seeks to defend himself, it is <b>permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:11 | “Or directs inquiries to the dead” | Sanhedrin 65b:13 | § The Talmud asks: <b>Isn’t</b> one who <b>inquires</b> about the future from <b>a necromancer</b> the same as what is described in the verse: <b>“Or directs inquiries to the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:11)? Why are they mentioned separately in the verse? |
| Deuteronomy 18:13 | not consult astrologers? As it is stated: “You shall be wholehearted with the Lord your God” | Pesachim 113b:15 | <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Shmuel bar Marta said</b> that Rav said, citing <b>R' Yosei of Hutzal: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> may <b>not consult astrologers? As it is stated: “You shall be wholehearted with YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:13). The Torah demands absolute faith in God and acceptance of His justice, without attempting to predict the future. |
| Deuteronomy 18:15 | “To him you shall listen” | Yevamot 90b:5 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof. The verse states with regard to a true prophet: <b>“To him you shall listen”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:15). From here it is derived that <b>even</b> if the prophet <b>says to you: Transgress one of the mitzvot of the Torah, for example, </b> as in the case of <b>Elijah at Mount Carmel, </b> who brought an offering to God on that mountain during a period when it was forbidden on pain of <i>karet</i> to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple, with regard to <b>everything</b> that he permits <b>for</b> the requirement of the <b>hour, </b> you must <b>listen to him. </b> This indicates that a Torah mitzva can indeed be uprooted in an active manner. |
| Deuteronomy 18:19 | whosoever shall not hearken [ yishma ] unto My words | Sanhedrin 89a:14 | <b>One who suppresses his prophecy, and one who</b> contemptuously <b>forgoes the statement of a prophet, and a prophet who violated his own statement, their execution is at the hand of Heaven, as it is written: </b> “And it shall come to pass, that <b>whosoever shall not hearken [<i>yishma</i>] unto My words</b> that he shall speak in My name, I will exact from him” (Deuteronomy 18:19). The reference is to one who forgoes the statement of a prophet. <b>Read into</b> the verse: Who <b>shall not voice [<i>yashmia</i>]; </b> the reference is to one who suppresses the prophecy. <b>And read into</b> the verse: <b>Shall not heed [<i>yishama</i>]; </b> the reference is to one who violated his own statement. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to all of these: <b>“I will exact from him, ”</b> meaning he is liable to receive death <b>at the hand of Heaven. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 18:19 | I will exact it of him” | Sanhedrin 89a:8 | <b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who suppresses his prophecy</b> because he does not want to share it with the public, <b>and one who</b> contemptuously <b>forgoes the statement of a prophet</b> and refuses to heed it, <b>and a prophet who violated his own statement</b> and failed to perform that which he was commanded to do, <b>his death is at the hand of Heaven, as it is stated: </b> “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not hearken unto My words that he shall speak in My name, <b>I will exact it of him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:19). |
| Deuteronomy 18:20 | a rebellious elder. | Sanhedrin 16a:7 | <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy, with the meaning of <b>presumptuousness</b> stated in the context of a false prophet learned <b>from presumptuousness</b> stated in the context of <b>a rebellious elder. </b> With regard to a false prophet the verse states: “But the prophet who shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die” (Deuteronomy 18:20), and with regard to a rebellious elder it states: “And the man that acts presumptuously, by not listening to the priest that stands to minister there before YHWH your God, or to the judge, that man shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:12). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to a rebellious elder, he is presumptuous <b>against</b> a court of <b>seventy-one</b> judges, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to a false prophet, he is judged <b>by</b> a court of <b>seventy-one</b> judges. |
| Deuteronomy 18:20 | as the verse states: | Sanhedrin 89a:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that it is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: </b> “But the prophet who shall sin intentionally to speak a word in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die” (Deuteronomy 18:20). The Talmud analyzes the verse: <b>“But the prophet who shall sin intentionally to speak a word in My name”; this</b> is a reference to <b>one who prophesies that which he did not hear. </b> The verse then states: <b>“That I have not commanded him, ”</b> from which it is inferred: <b>But I did command another. This</b> is a reference to <b>one who prophesies that which was not stated to him. “Or who shall speak in the name of other gods”; this</b> is a reference to <b>one who prophesies in the name of idol worship. And it is written</b> with regard to all of these: <b>“That prophet shall die. ” And every death stated in the Torah without specification</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than strangulation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:3 | “You shall prepare for yourself the way, | Bava Batra100b:1 | The standard width of <b>a public thoroughfare</b> is <b>sixteen cubits. A road</b> leading to one of the <b>cities of refuge</b> must be at least <b>thirty-two cubits</b> wide. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the cities of refuge: <b>“You shall prepare for yourself the way, </b> and divide the borders of your land that YHWH, your God, caused you to inherit, into three parts, so that every manslayer may flee there” (Deuteronomy 19:3). Instead of simply stating: <b>A way, </b> the verse states: <b>“The way, ”</b> to indicate that the road must be twice as wide as a standard public thoroughfare. |
| Deuteronomy 19:3 | “Prepare for you the road” | Makkot 10b:1 | <b>Refuge was written on</b> signs at every <b>crossroads</b> marking the path to a city of refuge, <b>so that the</b> unintentional <b>murderer would identify</b> the route to the city of refuge <b>and turn to</b> go <b>there. Rav Kahana said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>“Prepare for you the road”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:3), meaning: <b>Perform for you preparation of the road. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:3 | as it is stated: “Prepare for you the road, and divide | Makkot 9b:15 | The Mishnah continues: <b>And roads were aligned for them from this</b> city, i.e., all cities, <b>to that</b> city, i.e., they would pave and straighten the access roads to the cities of refuge, <b>as it is stated: “Prepare for you the road, and divide</b> the borders of your land, which YHWH your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every murderer may flee there” (Deuteronomy 19:3). |
| Deuteronomy 19:3 | “And you shall divide [ veshilashta ]” | Makkot 9b:18 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states: Moses designated three cities</b> of refuge <b>in the</b> east <b>bank of the Jordan, and corresponding to them, Joshua designated</b> three cities of refuge <b>in the land of Canaan. And the cities were aligned like two rows</b> of vines <b>in a vineyard: </b> In Eretz Yisrael there was <b>Hebron in Mount Judea, corresponding to Bezer in the wilderness; Shechem in Mount Ephraim, corresponding to Ramoth in the Gilead; </b> and <b>Kadesh in Mount Naphtali, corresponding to Golan in the Bashan. </b> From the term <b>“And you shall divide [<i>veshilashta</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:3), it is derived <b>that</b> the three cities in Eretz Yisrael will serve as <b>three [<i>meshulashin</i>]</b> lines of demarcation dividing the length of the land into four equal parts, in a manner <b>that</b> the distance <b>from the southern</b> border of Eretz Yisrael <b>to Hebron, </b> the southernmost city of refuge, <b>will be like</b> the distance <b>from Hebron to Shechem, and</b> the distance <b>from Hebron to Shechem</b> will be <b>like</b> the distance <b>from Shechem to Kadesh, and</b> the distance <b>from Shechem to Kadesh</b> will be <b>like</b> the distance <b>from Kadesh to the northern</b> border. |
| Deuteronomy 19:3 | “That every manslayer may flee there” | Sanhedrin 18b:1 | With regard to <b>one who kills a High Priest or a High Priest who killed a person, </b> he <b>never departs from</b> the city of refuge. Therefore, <b>I will say</b> that a High Priest <b>is not exiled</b> at all. For that reason, the <i>baraita</i> above <b>teaches us</b> that he is exiled. The Talmud suggests: Why not <b>say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indeed</b> that the High Priest would not be exiled, since he would not be able to return home? The Talmud responds: The <b>verse states</b> concerning the city of refuge: <b>“That every manslayer may flee there”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:3), and <b>even a High Priest is indicated</b> by the inclusive term “every. ” |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | unawares” | Bava Kamma86b:19 | <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>R' Meir? God wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), apparently <b>to exclude</b> one who happened to not see the one he killed; <b>and God wrote</b> in the Torah: “Who kills his neighbor <b>unawares”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), apparently <b>to exclude</b> a blind person, who is not aware of where others are standing. <b>This is a restriction following a restriction, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restriction following a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Therefore, a blind person is included in the <i>halakha</i> of those liable to be exiled for unintentional killing. |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | as it is stated: “And this is the matter [ devar ] of the murderer, | Makkot 10b:11 | The Talmud rejects this proof: <b>No, </b> the statement of the Torah scholars to the blood redeemer can be explained <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they will speak to him</b> about <b>matters appropriate to him. They say to</b> the blood redeemer: <b>Do not accord him treatment</b> appropriate for <b>murderers, </b> as it was <b>unintentionally</b> that <b>he came to be involved in the incident. R' Meir says: </b> The unintentional murderer too <b>speaks [<i>medabber</i>] on his own behalf</b> to dissuade the blood redeemer, <b>as it is stated: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the murderer, </b> who shall flee there and live” (Deuteronomy 19:4), indicating that the murderer himself apologizes and speaks to the blood redeemer. The rabbis <b>said to</b> R' Meir: <b>Many</b> matters <b>are performed</b> more effectively through <b>agency. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | “And he did not hate him from before” | Makkot 10b:8 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And for him there is no sentence of death”; the verse is speaking with regard to the</b> unintentional <b>murderer, </b> teaching that the unintentional murderer is not liable to be executed. That is why the Jewish people were commanded to establish cities of refuge to protect him. The <i>baraita</i> proceeds to prove that the verse is written with regard to the murderer. <b>Do you say</b> that it is speaking <b>with regard to the</b> unintentional <b>murderer, or</b> is it speaking <b>only with regard to the blood redeemer? When it states</b> in an earlier verse: <b>“And he did not hate him from before”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), it is clear that the reference is to the unintentional murderer, and therefore, <b>you must say</b> that in the phrase: “And for him there is no sentence of death,” <b>the verse is speaking with regard to the</b> unintentional <b>murderer. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | from them, as it is stated: “And this is the matter [ devar ] of the murderer” | Makkot 12b:10 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>Similarly, </b> in the case of <b>a murderer who was exiled to a city of refuge and the people of the city sought to honor him</b> due to his prominence, <b>he shall say to them: I am a murderer. </b> If the residents of the city <b>say to him: </b> We are aware of your status and <b>nevertheless, </b> we wish to honor you, <b>he may accept</b> the honor <b>from them, as it is stated: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the murderer”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), from which it is derived that the murderer is required to say [<i>ledabber</i>] to them that he is a murderer. He is not required to tell them any more than that. |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | intentionally. “Unawares” | Makkot 7b:3 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> derivations from verses written with regard to the unintentional murderer: <b>“Unintentionally”</b> (Numbers 35:11); to <b>exclude</b> from exile <b>the</b> one who kills <b>intentionally. “Unawares”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4); to <b>exclude</b> from exile <b>the</b> one who kills <b>with intent. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | as it is stated: “And this is the matter [ devar ] of the murderer, | Makkot 9b:16 | <b>And</b> the court <b>would provide</b> the unintentional murderers fleeing to a city of refuge with <b>two Torah scholars, </b> due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the blood redeemer, i.e., a relative of the murder victim seeking to avenge his death, <b>will</b> seek to <b>kill him in transit, and</b> in that case <b>they, </b> the scholars, <b>will talk to</b> the blood redeemer and dissuade him from killing the unintentional murderer. <b>R' Meir says: </b> The unintentional murderer <b>also speaks [<i>medabber</i>] on his own behalf</b> to dissuade the blood redeemer, <b>as it is stated: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the murderer, </b> who shall flee there and live” (Deuteronomy 19:4), indicating that the murderer himself speaks. |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | “without knowledge” | Makkot 9b:7 | <b>And R' Meir</b> interprets the verses differently: <b>“Without seeing”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a blind person, and <b>“without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4) also serves <b>to exclude</b> a blind person. <b>This is</b> an example of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. In this case, it includes a blind person in the <i>halakhot</i> of exile as well. |
| Deuteronomy 19:4 | without knowledge” | Nedarim 88a:2 | By contrast, <b>R' Meir maintains: It is written</b> in that same section: “One who strikes his neighbor <b>without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>anyone who is capable of knowing</b> the precise location of the people standing about him, <b>but a blind person is not capable of knowing</b> this. <b>And if you say</b> that the phrase <b>“without seeing”</b> serves <b>to exclude a blind person, </b> this <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the words <b>“without knowledge. ” Rather, learn from it</b> that the phrase <b>“without seeing”</b> serves <b>to include a blind person</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of exile, not to exclude him. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | raise a contradiction | Arakhin 30b:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the term <b>“finds” indicates</b> that the means were found <b>now</b> and were not previously available? <b>But</b> you can <b>raise a contradiction</b> to this premise from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to an unintentional killer: “And one who goes into the forest with another to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the blade slips off the wood, and finds another person, and he dies, he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). The term <b>“and finds” excludes one who introduces himself</b> into the area of danger. <b>From here R' Eliezer said: If, after the stone departed from</b> one’s <b>hand, the other</b> person <b>stuck his head out and received</b> a blow from <b>it</b> and died, the killer <b>is exempt</b> from exile. <b>Evidently, </b> the term <b>“finds” indicates an item that is</b> there <b>from the outset. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | a fortiori | Bava Kamma32a:5 | <b>Rava</b> disagreed with Rav Huna’s opinion and <b>said: </b> The husband is liable due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to manslaughter, as it is stated in the Torah: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood…and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). <b>And just as</b> in the <b>forest, where this</b> person <b>entered his domain and that</b> person <b>entered his domain, </b> as it is the domain of the public, and nevertheless the one who kills unintentionally is <b>considered like one who entered another’s domain and</b> is therefore <b>liable</b> to be exiled to a city of refuge, then with regard to <b>this</b> husband, <b>who</b> actually <b>enters another’s domain, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that he should be liable for the injury he causes her? |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | a forest, | Bava Kamma32b:8 | The Talmud explains that he is exempt <b>because</b> this case <b>is not similar to</b> the case of <b>a forest, </b> which is the archetypal case stated in the Torah requiring one who kills unintentionally to be exiled, as it is written: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5). This is because in the case of the <b>forest, </b> both <b>this one entered his domain and that one entered his domain, </b> as anyone may use the public domain, whereas in <b>this</b> case, the victim <b>entered another’s property. </b> Therefore, the carpenter is not exiled. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | and finds | Bava Kamma33a:2 | <b>Rav Zevid taught in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this</b> aforementioned statement of R' Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the above <i>baraita</i> but is <b>in reference to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the verse concerning one who kills unintentionally: “And the head slips off the helve, <b>and finds</b> his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5); this serves to <b>exclude</b> one <b>who introduces himself</b> into an area of danger, in which case the one who kills unintentionally is exempt from exile. <b>From here R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> With regard to <b>one whom a stone departed from his hand, and another</b> person <b>stuck out his head and received</b> a blow from <b>it</b> and died, the one who threw the stone is <b>exempt</b> from exile. It is in reference to this statement that <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He is exempt from exile</b> for killing him. <b>But</b> if the victim was merely injured, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | “As when one goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood” | Bava Kamma86b:18 | The Talmud explains the dispute: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Yehuda? </b> He would <b>say to you: </b> The verse states with regard to an unintentional killing, without any further limiting clause: <b>“As when one goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), <b>and</b> this includes <b>even a blind person; </b> therefore, <b>God wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), <b>to exclude</b> a blind person. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | “And he shall flee to one of the cities” | Makkot 2b:2 | § The Mishnah teaches that in a case where two witnesses came before the court and said: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so that he is liable to</b> be punished with <b>exile, </b> one does not say that these witnesses shall be exiled in his stead; rather, they receive forty lashes. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to an unwitting killer: <b>“And he shall flee to one of the cities”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), and the Talmud infers: <b>He</b> shall flee, <b>but conspiring</b> witnesses shall <b>not. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | from the wood” | Makkot 7b:18 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to the Rabbis: Is it stated</b> in the verse: <b>And the blade displaces from its wood</b> handle? <b>But isn’t it stated: </b> “And the blade displaces <b>from the wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), indicating that it is a wood chip from the tree that causes the death of the person? <b>And furthermore: <i>Etz</i> is stated below: </b> “And the blade displaces from the <i>etz</i>,” <b>and <i>etz</i> is stated above, </b> earlier in the same verse: “And his hand wields the ax to cut down the <i>etz</i>. ” <b>Just as</b> the term <b><i>etz</i> stated above</b> is referring to wood <b>from the tree that is being split, so too, </b> the term <b><i>etz</i> stated below</b> is referring to wood <b>from the tree that is being split, </b> not to the wood of the ax handle. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | “And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest” | Makkot 7b:7 | And it is written with regard to an unintentional murderer: <b>“And who did not lie in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13); this serves to <b>exclude</b> one who <b>had intent to throw</b> a stone <b>two</b> cubits <b>and he</b> inadvertently <b>threw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits and killed a person. And it is written concerning an unintentional murderer: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is derived: <b>Just as a forest</b> is ownerless property, and there is <b>permission for the victim and for the assailant to enter there, so too, </b> unintentional murder that occurs in <b>any</b> place where there is <b>permission for the victim and for the assailant to enter there, </b> is punishable with exile. The unintentional murder of one who entered the assailant’s property without his permission is not cause for the murderer to be exiled. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | The Sages taught | Makkot 8a:10 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> If after the stone left his hand the other person placed his head out into the public domain and received a blow from the stone, he is exempt. The Talmud cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>A baraita states</b> that it is written: “And the blade displaces from the wood and finds his neighbor and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is inferred: <b>“And finds”; </b> this serves <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>presents himself</b> and is thereby killed by the stone. <b>From here R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: If after the stone left his hand the other</b> person <b>placed his head out</b> into the public domain <b>and received</b> a blow from the stone, the murderer is <b>exempt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | One who throws a stone, etc. | Makkot 8a:13 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>One who throws a stone, etc.</b> Abba Shaul derives from the verse: “And as when one goes with his neighbor into the forest” (Deuteronomy 19:5): Just as the cutting of wood mentioned in the verse is optional, so too, all those liable to be exiled are in cases where the unintentional murderer was engaged in an activity that is optional. <b>One of the rabbis said to Rava: From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the derivation is <b>from the cutting of wood</b> for a purpose <b>that</b> is <b>optional? Perhaps</b> the derivation is <b>from the cutting of wood for</b> the purpose of building <b>a <i>sukka</i> or from cutting wood for the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, both of which are obligatory, since they are mitzvot, <b>and even so God states: Let him be exiled. </b> Rava <b>said to him: Since if one found</b> wood already <b>cut he does not cut</b> other wood, as in that case it is <b>not a mitzva</b> to cut, <b>now, </b> when there is no wood cut <b>as well, </b> although he is cutting wood to facilitate fulfillment of a mitzva, the act of cutting the wood itself is <b>not a mitzva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | “And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest” | Makkot 8a:5 | In the case of one who <b>threw the stone into his courtyard and killed</b> a person, <b>if the victim had permission to enter into there, </b> the murderer is <b>exiled, but if not, he is not exiled, as it is stated</b> with regard to the cities of refuge: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a forest, the victim and the assailant</b> both <b>have</b> equal <b>permission to enter there, so too, </b> with regard to <b>all</b> places that <b>the victim and the assailant have permission to enter there, </b> the killer is liable. This serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>courtyard of the homeowner, where the victim and the assailant do not</b> both <b>have permission to enter there. </b> Since the victim had no right to enter his courtyard, the unintentional murderer is exempt from exile. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | “And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest” | Makkot 9b:6 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda? </b> It is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to those who are exiled: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), which is stated in general terms, applying <b>even</b> to <b>a blind person. </b> The phrase <b>“without seeing” comes</b> and <b>excludes</b> a blind person from this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 19:5 | killer it is written: “And a man who goes into the forest with his neighbor | Nedarim 88a:1 | <b>Rava said: </b> There is no contradiction here, as the dispute with regard to an unintentional killing is based on divergent interpretations of the verse. <b>Here, </b> the ruling follows <b>from the context of the verse, and there, </b> the ruling follows <b>from the context of the verse. R' Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>with regard to</b> the exile of an unintentional <b>killer it is written: “And a man who goes into the forest with his neighbor</b> to hew wood” (Deuteronomy 19:5), which serves to include <b>anyone</b> who <b>is capable of entering a forest, and a blind person is also capable of entering a forest. And if you say</b> that the phrase <b>“without seeing”</b> serves <b>to include a blind person, </b> this <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the word <b>“forest, ”</b> as he too can enter a forest. <b>Rather, learn from it</b> that the phrase <b>“without seeing”</b> serves <b>to exclude a blind person</b> from the category of unintentional killers who are exiled to a city of refuge. |
| Deuteronomy 19:6 | and for him there is no sentence of death, | Makkot 10b:7 | § The Talmud resumes its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of exile. <b>Rav Huna says: </b> In the case of an unintentional <b>murderer who was exiled to a city of refuge, and the blood redeemer found him</b> on the way <b>and killed him, </b> he is <b>exempt. </b> The Talmud notes: <b>Rav Huna holds</b> that the verse: “Lest the blood redeemer pursue the murderer…and strike him fatally…<b>and for him there is no sentence of death, </b> as he did not hate him from before” (Deuteronomy 19:6), <b>is written with regard to the blood redeemer, </b> teaching that the blood redeemer is not liable to be executed for killing the murderer. |
| Deuteronomy 19:10 | and so blood be upon you” | Moed Katan5a:11 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> agents of the court <b>did not go out and do all these</b> repairs, <b>that</b> with regard to <b>any blood that is shed there</b> on account of their negligence, <b>the verse ascribes to them</b> guilt <b>as if they had shed it? The verse states</b> with regard to the cities of refuge that offer protection to someone who committed inadvertent manslaughter: “That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which YHWH your God gives you for an inheritance, <b>and so blood be upon you”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:10). The Talmud maintains that the Mishnah uses the word all to allude to the cases mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>, and not to the digging of public cisterns. |
| Deuteronomy 19:11 | as the verse states: “And he lay in wait for him, and rose against him, | Bava Kamma44b:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the owner himself, from where do we</b> derive that he is not liable unless he killed the one whom he intended to kill? It is <b>as the verse states: “And he lay in wait for him, and rose against him, </b> and struck him mortally and he died” (Deuteronomy 19:11). From the term “for him,” R' Shimon derives that the killer is not liable <b>unless he intends</b> to kill <b>him, </b> i.e., the one whom he ultimately killed. |
| Deuteronomy 19:11 | as it is written: “And he lies in wait for him, and rises up against him” | Bava Kamma86a:17 | The Talmud explains R' Shimon’s statement: <b>What is the reason</b> for exempting one who humiliated a person whom he did not intend to humiliate? The <i>halakha</i> of humiliation is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>killing. Just as</b> in a case of <b>killing, </b> the murderer is not executed <b>unless he intended</b> to kill the victim specifically, <b>as it is written: “And he lies in wait for him, and rises up against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:11), which means he is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to kill <b>him</b> specifically, so <b>too, </b> in a case of <b>humiliation, </b> the one who humiliated is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically, <b>as it is written: “And she put forth her hand, and took him by his genitals”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11); this teaches that one is not liable for humiliation <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically. |
| Deuteronomy 19:11 | “And lie in wait for him, and rise up against him” | Ketubot 15a:13 | After citing a tannaitic source for R' Zeira’s opinion, the Talmud asks: <b>And from where in the Torah do we</b> derive that the legal status of any item fixed in its place is like that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced, both when it leads to leniency and when it leads to stringency? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states</b> with regard to a murderer: <b>“And lie in wait for him, and rise up against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:11), indicating that one is liable <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he intends to</b> kill <b>him. </b> One who intended to kill one person and inadvertently killed another is exempt from punishment. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis, </b> who hold that one is liable in that case, interpret that verse? The rabbis <b>of the school of R' Yannai say: </b> It <b>excludes</b> the case <b>of</b> one who <b>throws a stone into a crowd</b> and did not intend to kill a specific person. |
| Deuteronomy 19:11 | of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states: “But if there will be a man who hates his neighbor, and he lies in wait for him and rises up against him, | Sanhedrin 79a:7 | The Talmud seeks to clarify the rationale underlying the opinions of the Rabbis and R' Shimon, and asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Shimon? The verse states: “But if there will be a man who hates his neighbor, and he lies in wait for him and rises up against him, </b> and strikes him mortally and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:11). Based on the repeated use of pronouns in the phrase: “And lies in wait for him and rises up against him,” R' Shimon derives: One is not liable to be executed <b>until he intends to</b> kill specifically <b>him, </b> the actual victim. The Talmud asks: <b>And the Rabbis, </b> what do they derive from the repetitive pronouns in that phrase? The Talmud answers: The rabbis of <b>the school of R' Yannai say</b> that one derives: This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> one who <b>casts a stone into the midst</b> of a group of people and one of them is killed. Since he did not intend to kill any specific individual, he is not executed. |
| Deuteronomy 19:11 | equally balanced, | Sanhedrin 79a:9 | The Talmud explains: <b>No, </b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have this derivation only in a case <b>where there are nine Jews and one non-Jew among them, as</b> this is a case where the <b>non-Jew is a fixed</b> presence in the group, <b>and</b> the principle is: The legal status of <b>any</b> item <b>fixed</b> in its place <b>is like</b> that of an uncertainty that is <b>equally balanced, </b> and one does not follow the majority. This is what the Rabbis derive from the phrase: “And he lies in wait for him” (Deuteronomy 19:11). |
| Deuteronomy 19:12 | would execute him, as it is stated: “And the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hands of the blood redeemer and he shall die” | Makkot 10b:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>one who was</b> found <b>liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty for intentional murder, after the trial the court <b>would execute him, as it is stated: “And the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hands of the blood redeemer and he shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:12). And with regard to <b>one who was not</b> found <b>liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, e.g., if they deemed that it was due to circumstances beyond his control, <b>they freed him, as it is stated: “And the congregation shall rescue the murderer from the hands of the blood redeemer”</b> (Numbers 35:25). With regard to <b>one who was</b> found <b>liable to be exiled, </b> the court would <b>restore him to his place</b> in the city of refuge, <b>as it is stated: </b> “And the congregation shall judge between the murderer and the blood redeemer…<b>and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, that he fled there”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25). |
| Deuteronomy 19:14 | “You shall not remove your fellow’s boundary marker, which was bounded by the first ones, in your inheritance | Niddah 57a:1 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the Samaritans do not observe burial customs for stillborn children. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret</b> as a source for this practice? The Talmud replies that they interpreted the verse: <b>“You shall not remove your fellow’s boundary marker, which was bounded by the first ones, in your inheritance</b> that you shall inherit, in the land that YHWH your God gives you to possess it” (Deuteronomy 19:14). |
| Deuteronomy 19:14 | which is written: “You shall not cross your neighbor’s border, which they of the old times have set | Shabbat 85a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> when <b>the rabbis</b> have <b>an accepted</b> tradition it <b>is a</b> substantial <b>matter, </b> meaning that the tradition is reliable? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You shall not cross your neighbor’s border, which they of the old times have set</b> in your inheritance that you shall inherit” (Deuteronomy 19:14)? It means that <b>you shall not cross the border that the early</b> generations <b>set, </b> establishing the parameters necessary for each plant. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>The early</b> generations <b>set? R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which was written: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabit the land, </b> Lotan and Shoval and Zibeon and Ana” (Genesis 36:20)? <b>And is everyone</b> else <b>inhabitants of the heavens, </b> that it was necessary for the verse to emphasize that these inhabit the land? <b>Rather, </b> it means <b>that they were experts in the settlement of the land, as they would say: This</b> tract of land that is the <b>full</b> length <b>of a rod</b> is fit <b>for olive</b> trees; <b>this full</b> length <b>of a rod</b> is fit <b>for grapes, this full</b> length <b>of a rod</b> is fit <b>for figs. And</b> the members of this tribe were called <b>Horites [<i>ḥori</i>]</b> since <b>they smelled [<i>heriḥu</i>] the earth</b> to determine what is fit to be grown there. The allusion is based on a transposition of the letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>reish</i>. <b>And</b> in explanation of why the early inhabitants of Seir were called <b>Hivites [<i>ḥivi</i>]</b> (see Genesis 36:2), <b>Rav Pappa said: </b> Because <b>they would taste the earth like a snake [<i>ḥivya</i>]</b> and determine what should be grown there according to the taste. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that they were called <b>Horites [<i>ḥori</i>]</b> because <b>they became free [<i>benei ḥorin</i>] of their possessions</b> when the children of Esau drove them from their lands. Their primary name was actually Hivites. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” | Bava Batra160b:6 | <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel said</b> that there is a different source for two sets of <i>halakhot</i> for two types of documents <b>from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>If</b> witnesses’ <b>testimony is established with two</b> witnesses, <b>why</b> did the verse <b>specify for you</b> that it is also established <b>with three, </b> which is self-evident? Rather, this verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that there is a requirement for <b>two</b> witnesses <b>for an ordinary</b> document, and a requirement for <b>three</b> witnesses <b>for a tied</b> document. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses | Bava Batra160b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>these</b> verses <b>are coming for this</b> purpose, to teach that there are two types of documents? But <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>comes for its</b> own <b>purpose. </b> The first verse comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, </b> and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44), it is merely to <b>teach us good advice, </b> that people should carefully document their purchases in order to provide permanent proof of purchase. When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), <b>this was</b> merely how that <b>incident</b> occurred, and the phrase is not intended to teach any <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses</b> shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), this is stated in order <b>to juxtapose three</b> witnesses <b>with two</b> witnesses for several reasons, as delineated <b>in the dispute between R' Akiva and the Rabbis</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 5b). |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | said to him: I say this as well, but Rabbi Akiva disagrees with regard to this matter, as Rabbi Akiva would say | Bava Batra56b:4 | The latter <b>said to him: I say this as well, but R' Akiva disagrees with regard to this matter, as R' Akiva would say</b> that since the verse states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), one can derive that testimony is accepted only with regard to a complete <b>matter, and not</b> with regard to <b>half</b> of <b>a matter. </b> In this Mishnah, although presumptive ownership requires testimony that the property had been worked and profited from for three years, testimony is accepted from each pair of witnesses with regard to one year. Consequently, the ruling of the Mishnah does not accord with the opinion of R' Akiva. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | Rabbi Akiva, | Bava Kamma70a:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that if two witnesses testify about the theft of an animal and two others testify about its slaughter or sale, the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us say that the Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, </b> in his exposition of the verse: “Based on the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | a matter and not half of a matter, | Bava Kamma70b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, </b> who disagree with R' Akiva that the Torah stipulates that testimony must be about <b>a matter and not half of a matter, </b> the term “matter” (Deuteronomy 19:15) serves <b>to exclude what? </b> The Talmud answers: It serves <b>to exclude</b> a case involving testimony that a girl has reached majority, in which <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair on <b>her</b> lower <b>back, and one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair on <b>her</b> lower <b>abdomen. </b> A girl is considered to have reached maturity when she has two pubic hairs. In this case, two witnesses separately testify that they have each seen one hair, and therefore each testimony is halakhically meaningless on its own. The Rabbis derive from the verse that these testimonies do not combine. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | and it says over there: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established” | Gittin 89a:4 | <b>R' Yoḥanan ben Nuri said to him: If so, you have not allowed</b> any <b>daughter of Abraham our forefather to remain with her husband, </b> i.e., all wives will be forced to leave their husbands, as it is common for women to slander their peers. <b>And the Torah said: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her, </b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it says over there: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as there, </b> the word “matter” is referring to <b>a clear matter, </b> as it is established through witnesses, <b>so too here, </b> the unseemly matter that is considered a cause for divorce is also referring to <b>a clear matter</b> that was not established merely through a rumor. Rava’s statement is in accordance with this opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established” | Gittin 90a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what do Beit Shammai do with this</b> word <b>“matter”? </b> How do they interpret it? It seems superfluous, as in their opinion the verse refers specifically to a wife who engaged in forbidden sex. The Talmud answers: The word <b>“matter” is stated here, </b> with regard to divorce, <b>and</b> the word <b>“matter” is stated there, </b> with regard to testimony: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as there, </b> it is stated that a matter is established only <b>through two witnesses, so too here, </b> a matter of forbidden sex justifies divorce only if it is established <b>through two witnesses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | on the testimony of a single witness. | Ketubot 21a:4 | <b>That</b> is due to the fact that <b>if</b> it is <b>so</b> that the witnesses are testifying about the sum of one hundred dinars that is in the document and only one other witness joined the surviving witness in testifying with regard to that signature, the result would be that the entire sum <b>of money, less one-quarter, is collected</b> based <b>on the testimony of a single witness. </b> The surviving signatory authenticates his signature and thereby facilitates collection of half the sum. In addition, his testimony together with the testimony of the witness from the street authenticating the signature of the deceased signatory facilitates collection of the other half. Based on the verse: “At the mouth of two witnesses…shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), each witness is responsible for half the sum. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin” | Ketubot 87b:12 | § The Mishnah teaches that if <b>one witness testifies that</b> the marriage contract <b>was paid</b> she must take an oath. <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that this is <b>an oath</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). From here it is inferred: <b>It is for any iniquity or for any sin that he may not rise up, </b> i.e., the testimony of one witness is not enough for these purposes, <b>but he may rise up for an oath. And the Master said: </b> In <b>any place, </b> i.e., situation, <b>where two</b> witnesses are able to <b>deem one liable</b> to pay <b>money, </b> the testimony of <b>one</b> witness <b>obligates him to take an oath. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | The Merciful One states: “At the mouths of two witnesses, | Kiddushin 65b:9 | The Talmud relates: <b>Mar Zutra and Rav Adda the Elder, the sons of Rav Mari bar Issur, divided their</b> shared <b>property between them. They came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him</b> that they had the following dilemma. <b>God states: “At the mouths of two witnesses, </b> or at the mouths of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). Why do we say that two witnesses are required? So <b>that if</b> the parties involved <b>wish to retract</b> from their agreement and say that it never happened, <b>they cannot retract</b> from their agreement. <b>And</b> as <b>we will not retract</b> from our agreement, we do not require witnesses to establish our division of the property. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | shall a matter be established” | Makkot 6a:7 | Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Although it is possible to construct a scenario where the victim did not witness the act, it is difficult to construct a scenario where the perpetrator did not witness the act. Therefore, the <b>murderer and the one who sodomizes should spare</b> themselves from execution and void the testimony because they witnessed the act, and they are disqualified from bearing witness on the grounds that a person is not capable of testifying about himself. Abaye <b>was silent</b> and was unable to respond. <b>When</b> Rav Pappa <b>came before Rava</b> with this question, Rava <b>said to him: </b> It is written: “According to two witnesses or three witnesses <b>shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15); it is <b>with regard to</b> those who <b>establish a matter</b> as legal fact in court that <b>the verse is speaking. </b> It is only witnesses who are relatives or otherwise disqualified who void the entire testimony, not subjects of the matter. Therefore, there is no basis for the questions of Rav Pappa. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man” | Pesachim 113b:3 | The Talmud comments: This is <b>like</b> that incident <b>where Tuveya sinned</b> with immorality, <b>and Zigud came alone to testify about him before Rav Pappa. </b> Rav Pappa instructed that <b>Zigud be lashed. </b> Zigud <b>said to him: Tuveya sinned and Zigud is lashed, </b> an objection that became a popular saying. <b>He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>and you testified against him alone. You have merely given him a bad reputation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | And it is taught | Sanhedrin 30a:27 | The Talmud explains: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15); <b>by inference, from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>A witness shall not rise up</b> against a man, even without the word “one,” <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness? After all, the verse is written in the singular. Therefore, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness”? |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | Rabbi Akiva, who said | Sanhedrin 86a:19 | The Talmud elaborates: It is <b>Ḥizkiyya who said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, who said</b> one derives from the verse: “On the basis of two witnesses…shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), that the testimony of witnesses is valid only when they attest to an entire <b>matter, but not</b> to <b>half a matter. </b> Since each pair of witnesses provides testimony concerning only half the transgression for which the perpetrator would be liable, i.e., they each testify to only the abduction or the sale, the testimony of each pair is not valid. Therefore, when they are deemed conspiring witnesses, they are not executed. <b>And R' Yoḥanan says</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who said</b> that one derives from the verse that the testimony is valid when they testify with regard to an entire <b>matter, and even</b> when they testify with regard to <b>half a matter. </b> Since the testimony of the two pairs of witnesses together constitutes a complete testimony, if they are rendered conspiring witnesses, they are executed. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | two | Shevuot 30a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to witnesses, or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to litigants</b> that the verse is speaking? <b>When it states: “Between whom the controversy is”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17), <b>the litigants are</b> already <b>stated</b> in the verse. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“then the two men shall stand”? </b> Apparently, it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking. And if it is your wish to say</b> that this is not a proof, another proof may be cited. <b>It is stated here: </b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there: </b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses” (Deuteronomy 19:15); <b>just as there, </b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here, </b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | As it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin” | Shevuot 40a:10 | <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>As it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). It is inferred from here that <b>it is for any iniquity or for any sin that he may not rise up, </b> as the testimony of one witness is not enough for this purpose, <b>but he may rise up to</b> render one liable to take <b>an oath. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>any place where two</b> witnesses <b>render</b> a defendant <b>liable</b> to pay <b>money, </b> the testimony of <b>one witness renders him liable</b> to take <b>an oath. </b> Therefore, since two witnesses render the defendant liable to pay if the claim is worth at least one <i>peruta</i>, so too, one witness renders him liable to take an oath with regard to a claim of this value. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | the verse states: “One witness [ ed ] shall not rise up against a man | Sotah 2a:13 | The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: <b>Or</b> perhaps the verse is referring <b>only</b> to a case where there was not <b>even one</b> witness to the act of sex, as the singular usage of the word <i>ed</i> would seem to indicate? The <i>baraita</i> now proves that elsewhere the word <i>ed</i> is used to indicate two witnesses, as <b>the verse states: “One witness [<i>ed</i>] shall not rise up against a man</b> for any iniquity or any sin that he sins; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “A witness shall not rise up against a man” | Sotah 2b:1 | The <i>baraita</i> infers a general principle from this verse by asking: <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse, even with the omission of the word “one”: <b>“A witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness, as the term “rise up [<i>yakum</i>]” is written in the singular form? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness,” since it is obviously referring to only one witness? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>This established a paradigm</b> that <b>every place</b> where the word <b>“witness [<i>ed</i>]” is stated</b> in the Torah without specifying a number, <b>there are two</b> witnesses <b>here, unless the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to only one witness by writing the word <b>“one. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “One witness shall not rise up against a man” | Sotah 2b:3 | The Talmud questions this reasoning: <b>But</b> this would seem to indicate that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> to interpret the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> as referring to a case where there is only one witness is <b>that it is written</b> in the other verse: <b>“One witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), indicating that any unspecified usage of the word <i>ed</i> in the Torah refers to two witnesses, <b>but</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> inference, <b>I would say</b> that when the term <b>witness</b> is employed in the verse <b>concerning a <i>sota</i></b> it <b>is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness. However, this would mean that the woman is forbidden to her husband even if there is not even one witness who saw the alleged sex, <b>and if there is not even one</b> witness to testify, <b>then with what</b> testimony <b>does she become forbidden</b> to her husband? Obviously, even without another verse, it must be understood that the verse is indicating that there are not two witnesses but there is one, or else there would be no testimony to her actions. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | the verse states: “One witness [ ed ] shall not rise up against a man | Sotah 31b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: Do <b>you say</b> that the verse refers <b>only</b> to a case where there was not <b>even one</b> witness to the act of sex, as the singular usage of the word <i>ed</i> would seem to indicate? The <i>baraita</i> now proves that the singular usage notwithstanding, elsewhere the word <i>ed</i> is used to indicate two witnesses, as <b>the verse states: “One witness [<i>ed</i>] shall not rise up against a man</b> for any iniquity or any sin that he sins; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “A witness shall not rise up | Sotah 31b:12 | The <i>baraita</i> infers a general principle from this verse by asking: <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse, even with the omission of the word “one”: <b>“A witness shall not rise up</b> against a man” (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness, as the verse is written in the singular form? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness,” being that it is obviously referring to only one witness? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>This established a paradigm</b> for the principle that <b>every place</b> where the word <b>“witness [<i>ed</i>]” is stated</b> in the Torah without specifying a number, <b>there are two</b> witnesses <b>here, until the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to only one witness, by writing the word <b>“one. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | shall a matter [ davar ] be established” | Sotah 31b:2 | Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: </b> “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] in her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there, </b> in the laws concerning monetary matters, <b>it states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, </b> or at the mouth of three witnesses, <b>shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the “matter” stated <b>there</b> is established <b>“at the mouth of two witnesses, ” so too, here</b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>“at the mouth of two</b> witnesses. ” |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | a matter [ davar ] | Sotah 31b:8 | The Talmud continues to explain the Mishnah: <b>And</b> concerning <b>an ordinary</b> accusation of <b>defilement without a</b> previous <b>warning and without</b> an act of <b>seclusion</b> with another man, <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>a single witness is not deemed credible? </b> It is for this <i>halakha</i> that the Mishnah cites the verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here: </b> “Because he has found some unseemly <b>matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> concerning monetary matters: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall <b>a matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as</b> the “matter” stated <b>there</b> with regard to monetary matters is clarified specifically <b>by</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses, so too, here</b> with regard to adultery the “matter” of her defilement must be established <b>by</b> the testimony of at least <b>two witnesses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [ davar ] be established” | Sotah 3b:19 | Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: </b> “If a man marries a woman and lives with her and it will be that she not find favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there, </b> in the verses concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters, <b>it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established <b>by the mouth of two witnesses, so too here, </b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>by the mouth of two</b> witnesses. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” | Sotah 3b:22 | The Talmud comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>defilement in general, without</b> a prior <b>warning and without</b> witnesses to <b>seclusion, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established by <b>two witnesses, so too here, </b> with regard to defilement it is established by <b>two witnesses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | “By the mouth of two witnesses | Yevamot 101b:17 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> to him: <b>I would exact payment based on the word of</b> someone <b>such as Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, </b> as he has shown that he is upright and honest by revealing this unknown fact about himself. The Talmud questions: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that <b>one can</b> actually <b>exact</b> payment based on the word of one man, no matter how honest he seems to be? Doesn’t <b>God state</b> in the Torah: <b>“By the mouth of two witnesses</b> or by the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), indicating that one can exact payment based only on the evidence of at least two witnesses? <b>Rather, </b> the Talmud explains that Rav Yehuda’s intention was to say: <b>I would declare a bill</b> of indebtedness <b>invalid based on his word, </b> accepting his claim that the debt had been collected. |
| Deuteronomy 19:15 | And the Merciful One states: | Yevamot 31b:10 | If <b>we leave it with the witnesses</b> who signed the document, <b>if they remember</b> themselves the date when the deed was given to the woman, the date need not be written in the document itself, for <b>let them come forth and testify</b> from their memory. <b>And if</b> they do <b>not</b> remember by themselves, then <b>there are times when they see</b> the date <b>that is written and come forth to testify</b> on that basis. <b>And God states: </b> “By the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). From this verse it is derived: <b>From their mouths, and not from their writings, </b> indicating that testimony is proper only if the individual stated it of himself, and not on the basis of what is written. |
| Deuteronomy 19:16 | to bear perverted witness against him” | Makkot 5a:9 | <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught</b> a different source for this <i>halakha</i>. It is stated in that passage: “If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man <b>to bear perverted witness against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:16), indicating that the witnesses are not rendered conspiring witnesses <b>until the body of the testimony is rendered perverted, </b> but not through contradiction of any aspect of the testimony. |
| Deuteronomy 19:17 | “Then the two men shall stand” | Bava Batra155b:11 | <b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: </b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is movable property different</b> from land?

Mar Zutra <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>There, </b> with regard to testimony, <b>I require</b> the witnesses to be men, as the verse states: <b>“Then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17), which is interpreted as referring to witnesses, <b>and</b> this requirement is <b>not</b> fulfilled in the case of young children. |
| Deuteronomy 19:17 | you are standing, as it is stated: “Then both the people, between whom the controversy is, shall stand | Sanhedrin 19a:17 | The Talmud continues to narrate the incident: Yannai <b>came and sat down.

| Deuteronomy 19:17 | man. And the witnesses should know about whom they are testifying, and before Whom they are testifying, and Who will ultimately exact payment from them, as it is stated: “Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord” | Sanhedrin 6b:13 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a student who is sitting before his teacher and</b> he <b>sees</b> a point of <b>merit for a poor person or liability for a wealthy person, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he should not be silent?

| Deuteronomy 19:17 | When it states: “Between whom the controversy is” | Shevuot 30a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to witnesses, or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to litigants</b> that the verse is speaking? <b>When it states: “Between whom the controversy is”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17), <b>the litigants are</b> already <b>stated</b> in the verse. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“then the two men shall stand”? </b> Apparently, it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.

| Deuteronomy 19:17 | while standing, as it is written: “Then the two men shall stand” | Shevuot 30b:2 | § <b>Ulla says: </b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and R' Yehuda with regard to the obligation to stand in court is only <b>with regard to the litigants; but with regard to the witnesses, everyone agrees</b> that they testify <b>while standing, as it is written: “Then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17). <b>Rav Huna says: </b> The <b>dispute</b> whether the litigants are required to stand is only <b>at the time of the deliberation, but at the time of the verdict, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>judges</b> issue the verdict <b>while sitting and the litigants</b> receive the verdict <b>while standing, as it is written: “And Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood”</b> (Exodus 18:13). |
| Deuteronomy 19:18 | slave should be fit to bear witness, as it is written: “And behold, the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother” | Bava Kamma88a:6 | The Talmud challenges further: <b>If that is so, </b> then <b>according to the rabbis, </b> who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <b>slave should be fit to bear witness, as it is written: “And behold, the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18). If a slave is considered a brother, why is he not eligible to testify in court? |
| Deuteronomy 19:18 | “And the witness is a false witness; he testified falsely | Makkot 5a:8 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that witnesses are rendered conspiring witnesses only if the second set testifies that the first set was with them elsewhere at that time, and not if they directly contradict the testimony of the first set, the Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Adda said: </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And the witness is a false witness; he testified falsely</b> against his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:18), indicating that they are not rendered conspiring witnesses <b>until the body of the testimony is rendered false, </b> i.e., the testimony with regard to the actual witnesses was proven wrong, as they were not there at the time of the event in question. |
| Deuteronomy 19:18 | “And the judges shall inquire diligently” | Sanhedrin 40a:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source for these seven interrogations? <b>Rav Yehuda says: </b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to an idolatrous city: <b>“And you shall inquire, and investigate, and ask diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:15); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to one who worships idols: <b>“If it be told to you and you have heard it and inquired diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:4); <b>and</b> it <b>states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And the judges shall inquire diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18). Taken together, there are seven interrogations alluded to in these verses by each instance of the terms inquire, investigate, and diligently. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | the full | Bava Batra56a:10 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If <b>there were two</b> witnesses <b>testifying on his behalf that</b> he, the possessor of the land, worked and <b>profited</b> from a field for <b>three years, </b> and therefore has presumptive ownership, <b>and they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, as it was proven that they were not present to witness the matter about which they had testified, they must <b>pay</b> the true owner of the field <b>the full</b> value of the field that they attempted, through their testimony, to remove from his possession, as it is written in the Torah: “Then shall you do to him, as he had planned to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If <b>two</b> witnesses testify that he worked and profited from the field <b>during the first</b> year, another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the second</b> year, <b>and</b> another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the 3rd, </b> and all were found to be conspiring witnesses, |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | And concerning this it is stated: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired to do | Bava Kamma24a:14 | If <b>the 3rd group</b> of witnesses was also <b>determined to be conspiring witnesses, all</b> the witnesses become <b>liable. </b> The 3rd group is liable to pay the owner of the animal the payment for half the cost of the damage they tried to make him pay for the 3rd incident of goring, and all three groups must share in the payment of the other half of the damage for the final incident that they tried to charge him for by classifying his ox as forewarned. <b>And concerning this it is stated: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired to do</b> unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | an action, as it is written: “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do unto his brother” | Bava Kamma5a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the case of <b>conspiring witnesses</b> a case of <b>speech that involves no action, </b> as they are liable for their testimony, <b>and</b> R' Ḥiyya <b>teaches</b> it and includes it in his list? The Talmud answers: <b>There, although it involves no action, God characterizes it</b> as <b>an action, as it is written: “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19). |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | pay everything, | Bava Kamma72b:4 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>and</b> these witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, these witnesses <b>pay everything, </b> i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment. This is in accordance with the Torah’s decree with regard to conspiring witnesses: “You shall do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). Since these witnesses attempted to obligate the alleged thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, they themselves must pay that full amount. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | verse. Now, it is written: “And you shall do to him as he purposed to do to his brother” | Bava Kamma84a:8 | The rabbis <b>say: </b> The rabbis of <b>the school of R' Ḥiyya are interpreting a superfluous</b> phrase in the <b>verse.

| Deuteronomy 19:19 | as it is written: “You shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother” | Bava Kamma88a:4 | The Talmud challenges: <b>If that is so, </b> then <b>according to R' Yehuda, </b> who holds that slaves are not in the category of brothers, <b>conspiring witnesses</b> who testify that a Canaanite <b>slave</b> committed a sin punishable by capital punishment <b>should not be put to death</b> by the court, <b>as it is written: “You shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), and the slave is not considered a brother. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: The</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall put away the evil from your midst, ”</b> indicating that the punishment for conspiring witnesses should be applied <b>in any case, </b> including when they testified about a slave. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | whom the Merciful One states: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired | Chullin 11b:7 | <b>Ravina said: </b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses, </b> with regard to <b>whom God states: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired</b> to do unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If the witnesses testified falsely that a person is guilty of a capital offense, they are liable to receive the death penalty. <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps that</b> person <b>against whom they testified was a <i>tereifa</i>, </b> and they should not be executed for conspiring to have a <i>tereifa</i> executed. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of people, who are not <i>tereifot</i>? |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother” | Ketubot 32b:6 | <b>And</b> with regard to that Mishnah, the Talmud asks: <b>Let us say, </b> on the contrary, that <b>anyone who is flogged does not pay. R' Ile’a said: The Torah explicitly amplified</b> the case of <b>conspiring witnesses for payment, </b> not lashes. The Talmud asks: <b>Where did the Torah amplify</b> the case of conspiring witnesses? The Talmud explains: <b>Now, since it states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19); <b>why do I</b> require the Torah to state in his punishment: <b>“A hand for a hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? This indicates that the punishment that takes precedence is one in which there is <b>an item that is given from hand to hand, and what is that</b> item? It is <b>money. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother” | Ketubot 33a:6 | <b>Abaye then said: That which I stated is not</b> a significant <b>matter. </b> Instead, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <b>conspiring witnesses require forewarning, when we do not forewarn them we do not kill them. </b> However, <b>is there a matter in which they sought to kill</b> the defendant <b>without forewarning</b> him, as their testimony was false, <b>and</b> in order to punish them <b>they require forewarning? Don’t we require</b> that their punishment reflect the verse <b>“And you shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19)? <b>And</b> if they require forewarning that <b>is not</b> the case. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | as the verse states: “And you shall do to him as he conspired” | Makkot 2a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that the court does not punish the witnesses with the punishment they sought to have inflicted and disqualify them from the priesthood? <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), from which the Talmud infers: It is done <b>“to him, ” but not to his offspring. </b> Rendering the witness a <i>ḥalal</i> would disqualify his offspring as well. The Talmud challenges: <b>Let</b> the court <b>invalidate</b> the witness <b>and not invalidate his offspring. </b> The Talmud explains: That too would not accord with the directive in the verse, as based on the verse <b>we require</b> that the punishment be <b>“as he conspired to do”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>and</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here, as the witness conspired to disqualify the subject of his testimony and his offspring. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do to him as he conspired” | Makkot 2b:5 | § <b>Ulla says: From where</b> is <b>an allusion in the Torah to conspiring witnesses</b> derived? The Talmud asks: Is <b>an allusion to conspiring witnesses</b> required? <b>But isn’t it written</b> explicitly: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19)? <b>Rather, </b> Ulla’s question is: <b>From where</b> is <b>an allusion in the Torah to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that conspiring witnesses are flogged</b> in certain cases derived? It is derived from that <b>which is written: </b> “If there is a quarrel between people and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them, <b>and they vindicated the righteous and condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:1–2). Ostensibly, this verse is difficult: Is it <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>“they vindicated the righteous”</b> that they <b>“condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes”? </b> In most disputes, the fact that one party is vindicated does not necessarily lead to lashes for the other party. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do to him as he conspired” | Makkot 4a:12 | Likewise, if witnesses said: <b>We testify with regard to a man</b> called <b>so-and-so that he is liable</b> to receive <b>forty lashes, and they were discovered</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>they are flogged</b> with <b>eighty</b> lashes; one set of lashes <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor”</b> (Exodus 20:13), <b>and</b> one set of lashes <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), which is the punishment for conspiring witnesses; this is <b>the statement of R' Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are flogged</b> with <b>only forty</b> lashes, due to the verse “And you shall do to him as he conspired. ” |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | MISHNA: | Makkot 5a:2 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> When punishing conspiring witnesses based on the verse: “As he conspired to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>one divides</b> the punishment <b>of money</b> among them, <b>but one does not divide</b> the punishment <b>of lashes</b> among them; each receives thirty-nine lashes. The Mishnah elaborates: <b>How so? </b> If the witnesses <b>testified about</b> someone <b>that he owes another</b> person <b>two hundred dinars and they were</b> then <b>found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, the witnesses <b>divide</b> the sum <b>among themselves</b> and pay a total of two hundred dinars. <b>But if they testified about</b> someone <b>that he was liable</b> to receive <b>forty lashes and they were</b> then <b>found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>each and every one</b> of the witnesses <b>receives forty lashes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “As he conspired to do to his brother” | Makkot 5a:4 | <b>Rava said: </b> The reason the punishment of lashes is not divided is that <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: <b>“As he conspired to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>and</b> were the conspiring witness to receive fewer than thirty-nine lashes, the verse would <b>not</b> be fulfilled. The Talmud asks: <b>If so, </b> in the case of <b>money too, </b> one should not divide the sum between them, as each sought to cause the defendant loss of the entire sum. The Talmud answers: Sums of <b>money</b> paid by the witnesses can <b>combine, </b> as the person against whom they testified receives the entire sum that they sought to cause him to lose, but <b>lashes</b> administered to the witnesses <b>cannot combine. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | But wasn’t it already stated: “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do to his brother” | Makkot 5b:9 | <b>The Rabbis said to</b> the Sadducees: <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), <b>and</b> this latter verse indicates that <b>his</b> accused <b>brother is alive? And if so, why is it stated: “A life for a life”? </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if they are rendered conspiring witnesses <b>from the moment</b> the judges <b>accepted their testimony</b> in court, <b>they will be executed, </b> even though no verdict was concluded. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A life for a life, ”</b> teaching that <b>they are executed only</b> if they are rendered conspiring witnesses after <b>the verdict</b> of the accused <b>will be concluded, </b> from the moment that the court is on the verge of taking his life. |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | as he had planned | Sanhedrin 10a:8 | The Talmud interrupts with a question: <b>An allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses? But it is written</b> explicitly: “Then you shall do to him <b>as he had planned</b> to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). Why would there be a need for an allusion? <b>Rather, </b> Ulla meant: <b>From where</b> in the Torah is there <b>an allusion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>conspiring witnesses are flogged? </b> Ulla answers: <b>As it is written: “And they shall justify the just, and they shall condemn the wicked. </b> Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face. ” |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do to him as he conspired | Sanhedrin 51b:11 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The conspiring witnesses</b> concerning the daughter of a priest, <b>and</b> the <b>paramour of</b> the daughter of a priest, <b>are included in</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired</b> to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). |
| Deuteronomy 19:19 | “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do to his brother” | Sanhedrin 90a:12 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And conspiring</b> witnesses who testified that <b>the daughter of a priest</b> and her paramour committed adultery are executed by strangulation. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says: </b> It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yosei says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19)? The verse is formulated in this manner <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> in <b>all</b> cases involving those <b>rendered conspiring</b> witnesses <b>who are</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah, </b> e.g., forbidden relatives, the sentences of <b>their conspiring</b> witnesses <b>and their paramours are similar</b> to their own sentences, and the witnesses are executed by strangulation. |
| Deuteronomy 19:20 | any more | Makkot 4b:11 | The Talmud answers: <b>They require that</b> verse <b>as a prohibition against conspiring witnesses. </b> Every punishment enumerated in the Torah, including that of conspiring witnesses, is accompanied by an explicit verse prohibiting the action that results in the punishment. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>R' Meir, </b> who holds that conspiring witnesses are flogged for violating this prohibition, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>a prohibition for conspiring witnesses? R' Yirmeya said: He derives it from</b> the verse written in the context of conspiring witnesses: <b>“And those who remain shall hear and fear, and shall not continue</b> to perform <b>any more</b> evil of this kind in your midst” (Deuteronomy 19:20). The verse warns that conspiring witnesses should not continue with their sinful conduct. |
| Deuteronomy 19:20 | it is written: “And those who remain | Sanhedrin 89a:6 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There are <b>four</b> transgressors condemned to be executed whose verdicts <b>require a proclamation</b> to inform the public: <b>One who instigates</b> others to engage in idol worship, <b>and the stubborn and rebellious son, and the rebellious elder, and conspiring witnesses. In all of these</b> cases, <b>it is written concerning them: “And all the nation”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:13), or: <b>“And all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:12, 21:21), except <b>with regard to conspiring witnesses, </b> where <b>it is written: “And those who remain</b> shall hear and fear” (Deuteronomy 19:20), <b>as not everyone is fit for</b> providing <b>testimony. </b> Therefore, rather than saying that all of the nation or all of Israel must be informed, only those remaining who are not disqualified from providing testimony are those who must heed the verse: “Hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more such evil in the midst of you” (Deuteronomy 19:20). |
| Deuteronomy 19:21 | a hand for a hand, | Bava Kamma84a:7 | The Talmud presents another derivation: <b>The school of R' Ḥiyya taught</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: “And your eye shall not pity; a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, <b>a hand for a hand, </b> a foot for a foot” (Deuteronomy 19:21). This teaches that the witnesses pay compensation with <b>that which is given from hand to hand. And what</b> type of compensation <b>is that? Monetary restitution. </b> The Talmud challenges: <b>But if that is so, is</b> the phrase: <b>“A foot for a foot”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21), <b>also like that, </b> i.e., is it teaching that the witnesses pay compensation with an item passed from foot to foot? |
| Deuteronomy 19:21 | “A hand for a hand” | Bava Kamma84a:8 | The rabbis <b>say: </b> The rabbis of <b>the school of R' Ḥiyya are interpreting a superfluous</b> phrase in the <b>verse. Now, it is written: “And you shall do to him as he purposed to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19). <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse means this <b>literally, why do I</b> need the Torah to specify: <b>“A hand for a hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? The punishment will be whatever he purported to do to his brother. <b>Learn from</b> the extra phrase that the punishment is <b>monetary restitution. </b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“A foot for a foot”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? <b>Since it is written: “A hand for a hand, ”</b> God <b>also wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“A foot for a foot. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 19:21 | from: “Your eye | Bava Kamma86b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Yehuda? </b> He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy to: <b>“Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 25:12), stated with regard to humiliation, <b>from: “Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 19:21), stated with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses. </b> The analogy teaches that <b>just as there, </b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of conspiring witnesses, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included, as blind people cannot see events occur in order to testify, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of compensation for humiliation, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included. |
| Deuteronomy 19:21 | “A hand for a hand” | Ketubot 32b:6 | <b>And</b> with regard to that Mishnah, the Talmud asks: <b>Let us say, </b> on the contrary, that <b>anyone who is flogged does not pay. R' Ile’a said: The Torah explicitly amplified</b> the case of <b>conspiring witnesses for payment, </b> not lashes. The Talmud asks: <b>Where did the Torah amplify</b> the case of conspiring witnesses? The Talmud explains: <b>Now, since it states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19); <b>why do I</b> require the Torah to state in his punishment: <b>“A hand for a hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? This indicates that the punishment that takes precedence is one in which there is <b>an item that is given from hand to hand, and what is that</b> item? It is <b>money. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:2 | “And speak” | Sotah 42a:12 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud clarifies an ambiguous point in the Mishnah: <b>What is it saying</b> when the Mishnah derives from the verse that the priest must address the people in Hebrew? The Talmud answers: <b>This is what</b> the Mishnah <b>is saying: </b> The ruling is derived from a verbal analogy, <b>as it is stated</b> here: <b>“And speak”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:2), <b>and there, </b> concerning the giving of the Torah, <b>it is stated: “Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). <b>Just as there, </b> the voice spoke <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the priest speaks <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:2 | The Sages taught: “The priest shall approach and speak to the people” | Sotah 42a:13 | <b>A baraita states: “The priest shall approach and speak to the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:2). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>any priest who would want</b> to address the people may assume this role. To counter this idea, <b>the verse states: “And the officers shall speak”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:5). <b>Just as the officers</b> described are those who have been <b>appointed</b> to discharge their responsibilities, <b>so too, the priest</b> described is one who has been <b>appointed</b> for this role. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, why not <b>say</b> that <b>the High Priest</b> should deliver this address, as he is also appointed? The Talmud replies: The appointed priest must be <b>similar to</b> an appointed <b>officer. Just as an officer</b> is one <b>who has</b> someone else, i.e., a judge, with greater authority <b>appointed above him, so too, the priest</b> described must be one <b>who has</b> someone else, i.e., the High Priest, <b>appointed above him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:2 | as it is stated: “And it shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach | Sotah 42a:8 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> With regard to <b>the</b> priest who was <b>anointed for war, at the time that he</b> would <b>speak to the nation, he would speak</b> to them <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> Hebrew, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach</b> and speak to the people” (Deuteronomy 20:2). <b>This</b> priest identified in the verse is <b>the priest anointed for war, </b> the priest who is inaugurated specifically to serve this function. <b>“And speak to the people”; </b> he addresses them <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> Hebrew. |
| Deuteronomy 20:2 | shall approach” | Sotah 43a:10 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A priest speaks, and an officer calls out</b> his words; <b>and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A priest speaks and a priest calls out.

| Deuteronomy 20:3 | “Let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, | Sotah 42a:10 | The priest continues: <b>“Let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, </b> and do not be terrified of them” (Deuteronomy 20:3). <b>“Let not your heart faint” due to the neighing of horses and the sharpening of</b> the enemy’s <b>swords. “Fear not” due to the knocking of shields [<i>terisin</i>] and the noise of</b> their <b>boots [<i>calgassin</i>]. “Nor be alarmed” by the sound of trumpets. “Do not be terrified” due to the sound of shouts. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:3 | “And he shall say to them: Hear Israel” | Sotah 42a:15 | § The Torah says about the priest anointed for war: <b>“And he shall say to them: Hear Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:3). The Talmud asks: <b>What is different</b> in this setting that necessitates the usage of the phrase: <b>“Hear Israel”? R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: God said to the Jewish people: Even if you have not fulfilled</b> any mitzva <b>except reciting <i>Shema</i> of the morning and the evening, you</b> will <b>not be delivered into the hands</b> of your enemies. As an allusion to this promise, the priest’s address borrows the phrase “Hear Israel,” a phrase most familiar from the beginning of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 20:3 | “Let not your heart faint; fear not, | Sotah 42a:16 | With respect to the Mishnah’s comments about the verse: <b>“Let not your heart faint; fear not, </b> nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them” (Deuteronomy 20:3), <b>A baraita states</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18): The priest <b>speaks with them twice, one</b> time when they are gathered for war <b>at the border, and one</b> time when they are <b>on the battlefield</b> itself. When they are <b>at the border, what does he say? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:3 | shall say to them: Hear Israel, | Sotah 42a:9 | The Torah dictates the priest’s address: <b>“And</b> he <b>shall say to them: Hear Israel, </b> you draw near today to battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them” (Deuteronomy 20:3). The priest expounds: <b>“Against your enemies” and not against your brothers. </b> This is <b>not</b> a war of the tribe of <b>Judah against Simon and not Simon against Benjamin, </b> such <b>that if you fall into their hands</b> your brothers <b>will have mercy on you, as it is stated</b> with regard to a war between Judah and Israel: <b>“And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto their brethren; then they returned to Samaria”</b> (II Chronicles 28:15). Rather, <b>you are marching</b> to war <b>against your enemies, and if you fall into their hands, they</b> will <b>not have mercy on you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:3 | What does he say on the battlefield? “Let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them” | Sotah 42b:1 | <b>Hear my words, the regulations of war, </b> and consider who is fit to participate in the battle. <b>And return</b> home, all of you who are exempt from combat. <b>What does he say on the battlefield? “Let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, and do not be terrified of them”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:3). These four cautions <b>correspond</b> to <b>four actions done by the nations of the world: </b> They <b>clash</b> their weapons, <b>and</b> they <b>blast</b> horns, they <b>shout, and</b> they <b>trample</b> heavily with their horses to frighten their adversaries. |
| Deuteronomy 20:4 | “For the Lord your God is He that goes with you, | Sotah 42a:11 | The priest explains why the soldiers need not be terrified. <b>“For YHWH your God is He that goes with you, </b> to fight for you against your enemies, to save you” (Deuteronomy 20:4). Remember that <b>they come</b> to war <b>championed by flesh and blood, and you are coming championed by God. The Philistines came championed by Goliath. What was his end? In the end, he fell by the sword, and they fell with him</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 17). <b>The Ammonites came championed by Shobach. What was his end? In the end, he fell by the sword, and they fell with him</b> (see II Samuel, chapter 10). <b>But</b> as for <b>you, you are not so, </b> reliant upon the strength of mortals: <b>“For YHWH your God is He that goes with you, to fight for you</b> against your enemies, to save you”; <b>this</b> verse is referring to the <b>camp of the Ark</b> of the Covenant that accompanies them out to war. |
| Deuteronomy 20:4 | But you are not like them, | Sotah 42b:15 | The Mishnah recounts the priest’s address: <b>But you are not like them, </b> because, as the verse states: “For YHWH your God is He that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you” (Deuteronomy 20:4). <b>And why</b> does the verse elaborate <b>so much</b> in spelling out the nature of God’s attendance in battle? It is <b>because the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God <b>and all of His appellations</b> that are written on the tablets |
| Deuteronomy 20:5 | the verse states: “And the officers shall speak” | Sotah 42a:13 | <b>A baraita states: “The priest shall approach and speak to the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:2).

| Deuteronomy 20:5 | “What man is there that has built a new house, | Sotah 43a:11 | § The Mishnah teaches that the officers announce: <b>“What man is there that has built a new house, </b> and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it” (Deuteronomy 20:5). <b>A baraita states: </b> From the phrase <b>“That has built, ” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies to one <b>who has</b> literally <b>built</b> a house. <b>From where</b> do I derive that it includes one who <b>purchased, or inherited, or has been given</b> a house <b>as a gift? The verse states</b> broadly: <b>“What man is there that has built. ”</b> By not merely stating: One that has built, but using the expanded “what man is there that has built,” the verse includes any of these circumstances. |
| Deuteronomy 20:5 | “And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, | Sotah 43a:4 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The Mishnah continues its discussion of the speech given before battle. <b>“And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it?

He is sent home if he is <b>one who builds a storehouse for straw, a barn for cattle, a shed for wood, </b> or <b>a warehouse. </b> Similarly, it applies if he is <b>one who builds, or</b> if he is <b>one who purchases, or</b> if he is <b>one who inherits, or</b> if he is <b>one to whom</b> it <b>is given</b> as <b>a gift. </b> In all these instances, the man returns from the war encampment. |

| Deuteronomy 20:5 | that has built” | Sotah 44a:6 | § <b>A baraita states</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:20-21): The Torah states: “What man is there <b>that has built”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:5), and then <b>“that has planted”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6), and finally <b>“that has betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). <b>The Torah</b> has <b>taught</b> a person <b>the desired mode of behavior: A person should build a house, </b> then <b>plant a vineyard, and afterward marry a woman. And even</b> King <b>Solomon said in his wisdom: “Prepare your work outside, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterward build your house”</b> (Proverbs 24:27). The rabbis explained: <b>“Prepare your work outside”; this</b> is <b>a house. “And make it fit for yourself in the field”; this</b> is <b>a vineyard. “And afterward you shall build your house”; this</b> is <b>a wife. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:6 | “And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used the fruit | Sotah 43a:5 | The next verse states: <b>“And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used the fruit</b> thereof? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man use the fruit thereof” (Deuteronomy 20:6). He is sent home if he is <b>one who plants</b> a whole <b>vineyard</b> of many vines, <b>or</b> if he is <b>one who plants</b> as few as <b>five fruit trees</b> of another variety, <b>and even</b> if these five are <b>from the five species. </b> The produce need not be all of one species. The same applies if he is <b>one who plants, or</b> if he is <b>one who layers</b> the vine, bending a branch into the ground so that it may take root and grow as a new vine, <b>or</b> if he is <b>one who grafts</b> different trees onto one another. <b>And</b> it applies if he is <b>one who purchases</b> a vineyard, <b>or</b> if he is <b>one who inherits</b> a vineyard, <b>or</b> if he is <b>one to whom</b> the vineyard <b>is given</b> as <b>a gift. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:6 | ” | Sotah 43b:3 | § The Talmud continues its discussion of those who return from the ranks. <b>“And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, </b> and has not used the fruit thereof<b>”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6). <b>A baraita states: </b> From the phrase <b>“that has planted, ” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it applies to one who actually <b>planted</b> a vineyard. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the military exemption likewise includes one who <b>purchased</b> it, one who <b>inherited</b> it, <b>and</b> one <b>to whom</b> it <b>was given as a gift? The verse states: “And what man is there that has planted. ”</b> By not merely stating: One that has planted, but using the expanded “what man is there that has planted,” the verse includes any of these circumstances. |
| Deuteronomy 20:6 | “that has planted” | Sotah 44a:6 | § <b>A baraita states</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:20-21): The Torah states: “What man is there <b>that has built”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:5), and then <b>“that has planted”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6), and finally <b>“that has betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). <b>The Torah</b> has <b>taught</b> a person <b>the desired mode of behavior: A person should build a house, </b> then <b>plant a vineyard, and afterward marry a woman.

The rabbis explained: <b>“Prepare your work outside”; this</b> is <b>a house. “And make it fit for yourself in the field”; this</b> is <b>a vineyard. “And afterward you shall build your house”; this</b> is <b>a wife. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:7 | the verse states: “Lest he die in battle and another man take her” | Kiddushin 13b:15 | <b>Rather, </b> the source that a widow may remarry is <b>from that</b> which <b>the verse states: “Lest he die in battle and another man take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). This indicates that a man may marry a widow. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this: </b> One can <b>say: Who is</b> this <b>other</b> man mentioned by the verse? It is <b>a <i>yavam</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:7 | “And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, | Sotah 43a:6 | The next verse states: <b>“And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, </b> and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her” (Deuteronomy 20:7). He is sent home if he is <b>one who betroths a virgin, or</b> if he is <b>one who betroths a widow. </b> This applies <b>even</b> if his <i>yevama</i>, his late brother’s wife, is a <b>widow waiting for</b> him as <b>her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage; <b>and even</b> if <b>he heard that his brother died in the war</b> and the widow begins to wait for him only then, <b>he returns and goes</b> home. <b>Each of these</b> men, although they are exempt, still <b>hear the address of the priest</b> and <b>the regulations of war</b> at the local camp, <b>and</b> thereafter <b>they return</b> to their respective homes. However, they still support the war effort, <b>and</b> they <b>provide water and food</b> for the soldiers <b>and repair the roads. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:7 | “What man is there that has betrothed a wife | Sotah 44a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches among the statements that were said before battle: <b>“What man is there that has betrothed a wife</b> and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house” (Deuteronomy 20:7). <b>A baraita states: “That has betrothed”</b> is referring to <b>one who betroths a virgin, and</b> to <b>one who betroths a widow, and</b> to <b>one</b> whose <i>yevama</i> is <b>a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, </b> i.e., this man in the military ranks, to perform levirate marriage. <b>And even</b> if there are <b>five brothers, and one of them dies in the war, they all return</b> for the widow. In addition, the verse could have singled out one who has <b>not taken</b> a wife. When the verse specifies: <b>“and has not taken her, ”</b> this <b>excludes</b> men in forbidden marriages: <b>A widow</b> who is betrothed <b>to a High Priest; </b> either <b>a divorcée or a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>], </b> who is betrothed <b>to a common priest; a <i>mamzeret</i> or a Gibeonite woman</b> who is betrothed <b>to an Israelite; </b> or <b>an Israelite woman</b> who is betrothed <b>to a <i>mamzer</i> or to a Gibeonite. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:7 | “that has betrothed” | Sotah 44a:6 | § <b>A baraita states</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:20-21): The Torah states: “What man is there <b>that has built”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:5), and then <b>“that has planted”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6), and finally <b>“that has betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). <b>The Torah</b> has <b>taught</b> a person <b>the desired mode of behavior: A person should build a house, </b> then <b>plant a vineyard, and afterward marry a woman.

| Deuteronomy 20:8 | war. | Menachot 36a:4 | Concerning this, it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>spoke between</b> donning the <b>tefillin</b> of the arm <b>and</b> the <b>tefillin</b> of the head, <b>he has a sin, and due to</b> that sin <b>he returns from the ranks of</b> soldiers waging <b>war. </b> This is referring to the preparation for war, when the officers announce: “What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house” (Deuteronomy 20:8). The rabbis explained that this is referring to one who is fearful due to his transgressions. |

With regard to the house for which a man may be sent back from the camp, since the verse does not state merely: <b>“And has not dedicated, ”</b> but rather: <b>“And has not dedicated it, ”</b> specifying the particular house to which the man is connected, the verse therefore <b>excludes a robber</b> who does not own his house. The Talmud asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this opinion is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili?

| Deuteronomy 20:8 | “And the officers shall speak further to the people, | Sotah 44a:11 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> The Mishnah continues its discussion of the speech given before battle. <b>“And the officers shall speak further to the people, </b> and they shall say: What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?

| Deuteronomy 20:8 | “fearful and fainthearted” | Sotah 44a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this opinion is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili?

| Deuteronomy 20:8 | lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart” | Sotah 44b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one heard the sound of trumpets and trembled; </b> or he heard <b>the knocking of shields and</b> he <b>trembled; </b> or he heard <b>the sharpening of swords, and urine</b> was <b>trickling down his knees</b> in fear, <b>he returns</b> from the battlefront. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, </b> who interprets “fearful and fainthearted” literally, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>In this</b> case <b>even R' Yosei HaGelili</b> would <b>concede</b> that he should return, <b>because it is written: </b> “What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return…<b>lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:8). Someone so clearly frightened invariably spreads his fear to those around him. |
| Deuteronomy 20:9 | “And it shall be, when the officers conclude speaking to the people, that captains of legions shall be appointed at the head of the people” | Sotah 44a:13 | The Mishnah continues its discussion. The verse states: <b>“And it shall be, when the officers conclude speaking to the people, that captains of legions shall be appointed at the head of the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:9). The Mishnah adds: <b>As well as at the rear of the people. </b> The officers <b>station guards [<i>zekifin</i>] in front of them, and other</b> guards <b>behind them, and</b> they have <b>iron rods [<i>kashilin</i>] in their hands. And</b> with regard to <b>anyone who attempts to turn back</b> and flee from the war, the guard <b>has license to beat [<i>lekape’aḥ</i>] his legs</b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:9 | “And it shall be, when the officers conclude | Sotah 44b:6 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>“And it shall be, when the officers conclude</b> speaking to the people, that captains of legions shall be appointed at the head of the people” (Deuteronomy 20:9), and that the guards have the license to beat the legs of anyone who attempts to turn back and flee from the war, because the beginning of fleeing is a downfall. The Talmud is puzzled by the language of the Mishnah: <b>This</b> phrase: <b>Because the beginning of fleeing</b> is <b>a downfall, </b> appears to be backward. The Mishnah <b>should have</b> said the opposite: <b>Because the beginning of the downfall</b> is the act of <b>fleeing. </b> The Talmud concedes: Indeed, <b>say</b> that the Mishnah means: <b>Because the beginning of the downfall</b> is the act of <b>fleeing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:16 | “You shall allow nothing that breathes to live” | Sanhedrin 67a:20 | <b>In what</b> manner is <b>their death</b> sentence administered? <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated here: “You shall not allow a witch to live, ” and it is stated there, </b> with regard to the conquest of the Canaanites: <b>“You shall allow nothing that breathes to live”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16). <b>Just as there, </b> the Canaanites were to be killed <b>by</b> the <b>sword</b> (see Numbers 21:24), <b>so too here, </b> the execution of a witch is administered <b>by</b> the <b>sword. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:16 | Rabbi Shimon, | Sotah 36a:1 | <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Shimon, </b> who holds that the verse: “You shall keep alive no one who breathes” (Deuteronomy 20:16), is not referring to the non-Jews living outside of Eretz Yisrael, because there is no concern that the Jewish people will learn “to do like all their abominations” (Deuteronomy 20:18), as these Canaanites are not located in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 20:16 | “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” | Sotah 3b:4 | <b>What is the reason of R' Yishmael? Since it is written</b> with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall save alive nothing that breathes”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16), <b>it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), <b>as well, </b> in order <b>to permit one from any of the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who had sex with a Canaanite woman and she bore him a child. </b> This verse teaches <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites. Therefore, this verse cannot be teaching that it is mandatory. |
| Deuteronomy 20:18 | “Lest they teach you to do like all | Sotah 35b:10 | <b>R' Shimon says: </b> That is not what happened. Rather, the Jewish people <b>wrote</b> the text of the Torah <b>on top of</b> the <b>plaster, and they wrote below for</b> the non-Jews to read that the verse commands the Jewish people to destroy the non-Jew inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“Lest they teach you to do like all</b> their abominations” (Deuteronomy 20:18). <b>You derive</b> from the fact that they wrote this verse <b>that if</b> the non-Jews who lived in Eretz Israel <b>would have repented, </b> the Jews <b>would have accepted them, </b> i.e., allowed them to live in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | prohibited to cut it down, | Bava Batra26a:11 | Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: I</b> myself <b>will not cut them down, as Rav said: </b> With regard to <b>this palm tree that produces one <i>kav</i></b> of fruit, it is <b>prohibited to cut it down, </b> due to the verse: “You shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). <b>And R' Ḥanina says: My son Shikhḥat died only because he cut down a fig tree before its time. </b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan continued: <b>If the Master is amenable</b> to do so, he <b>may cut</b> them down, but I will not do it. |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | prohibited to cut it | Bava Kamma91b:17 | § In connection with the prohibition against cutting down trees the Talmud notes: <b>Rav said</b> with regard to <b>a palm tree that</b> still <b>produces</b> fruit in the amount of <b>a <i>kav</i>, </b> that it is <b>prohibited to cut it</b> down due to the prohibition of: “When you shall besiege a city…you shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | and its prohibition is from here: “For you may eat of it, and you shall not chop it down” | Makkot 22a:10 | <b>Ravina objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate one who chops down beautiful</b> fruit <b>trees</b> in the course of plowing, <b>and its prohibition is from here: “For you may eat of it, and you shall not chop it down”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19). |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | also wrote: “You shall not destroy its trees” | Sanhedrin 100b:4 | <b>If</b> your difficulty is <b>from its literal</b> meaning, that does not pose a difficulty, as <b>in the Torah, </b> God <b>also wrote: “You shall not destroy its trees”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19). It is prohibited to destroy both trees and fish skin arbitrarily. <b>If</b> your difficulty is <b>from</b> its <b>homiletic interpretation</b> as a euphemism, ben Sira <b>is teaching us proper conduct: </b> A man <b>should not have sex in an atypical manner, </b> i.e., anal sex, with his wife, as it causes her discomfort. |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | “Do not destroy” | Shabbat 129a:12 | <b>And Abaye said to Rabba: </b> In breaking the bench, <b>didn’t the Master violate</b> the prohibition, <b>“Do not destroy”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19)? It is prohibited to destroy objects of value. Rabba <b>said to him: Do not destroy</b> also with regard to destruction <b>of my body. </b> Preventing illness and danger <b>is preferable to me. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:19 | which is written: “For man is a tree of the field” | Taanit 7a:6 | <b>R' Yirmeya</b> once <b>said to R' Zeira: Let the Master come and teach</b> a halakhic discourse. R' Zeira <b>said to him: My heart is weak and I cannot</b> strain myself over a halakhic discourse. R' Yirmeya replied to him: In that case, <b>let the Master tell us a matter of <i>aggada</i>, </b> which does not require as much effort. R' Zeira <b>said to him</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For man is a tree of the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19)? <b>And is man</b> actually <b>a tree of the field? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:20 | is also taught | Bava Kamma91b:20 | <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: “Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, them you may destroy and cut down” (Deuteronomy 20:20). <b>“Only the trees of which you know”; this</b> is referring to <b>a tree</b> that bears fruit used for <b>food, </b> and it is permitted to cut down this type of tree under certain circumstances. <b>“That they are not trees for food”; this</b> is referring to <b>a barren tree. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:20 | until it falls” | Shabbat 19a:9 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not lay siege to cities of non-Jews fewer than three days before Shabbat, </b> to avoid the need to desecrate Shabbat in establishing the siege. <b>And if they</b> already <b>began</b> establishing the siege fewer than three days before Shabbat, <b>they need not stop</b> all war-related actions even on Shabbat. <b>And so Shammai would say: </b> From that which is written: “And you should build a siege against the city that is waging war with you <b>until it falls”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:20), it is derived that the siege should be sustained “until it falls. ” Consequently, the siege must continue <b>even on Shabbat. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 20:20 | “Them you may destroy and cut down” | Taanit 7a:7 | <b>Rather, </b> it is <b>because it is written</b> earlier in the same verse: <b>“You may eat of them but you may not cut them down, ” and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Them you may destroy and cut down”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:20). This indicates that there are certain trees which may be cut down, while others may not be destroyed. <b>How so? If a Torah scholar is worthy: “You may eat of them but you may not cut them down, ” but if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy: <b>“He you may destroy and cut down. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | that it is written: “If one is found slain in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it” | Bava Kamma82b:7 | The Talmud analyzes the next <i>halakha</i>: <b>And</b> its inhabitants do <b>not bring a heifer whose neck is broken. </b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “If one is found slain in the land that YHWH your God gives you to possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1). <b>And, </b> again, the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. Therefore, it is not included in the description: “The land that YHWH your God gives you to possess it. ” |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | in the land” | Sotah 44b:11 | If the corpse <b>was found concealed in a pile</b> of stones, <b>or hanging on a tree, or floating on the surface of the water, </b> then the judges <b>would not break the neck</b> of the heifer, <b>as it is stated: </b> “If one be found slain <b>in the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), <b>and not concealed in a pile</b> of stones; <b>“lying”</b> on the ground <b>and not hanging on a tree; “in the field, ” and not floating on the surface of the water. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | as it is written: “If one be found slain” | Sotah 45a:12 | In this case, <b>as it is written: “If one be found slain”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), the default assumption is that the <i>halakha</i> applies no matter <b>where it is found. </b> When the verse then states: <b>“In the ground, ”</b> it must be serving to <b>exclude</b> a matter, i.e., <b>a concealed</b> corpse. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>there, </b> in the case of forgotten sheaves, they also expound <b>based on the context of the verse, as it is written: “When you reap your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This indicates that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest: Just as</b> the <b>harvest</b> is performed <b>with revealed</b> objects, i.e., the growing grain, <b>so too, </b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>forgetting</b> pertain <b>to revealed</b> sheaves. Consequently, when <b>God writes</b> in the Torah <b>“in the field, ”</b> it must be in order <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves. |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | you to possess it” | Sotah 45b:12 | The Mishnah taught: <b>And</b> the inhabitants of <b>Jerusalem do not bring a heifer whose neck is broken. </b> The Talmud explains: This is <b>because the verse states: </b> “If one be found slain in the land which YHWH your God has given <b>you to possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes</b> in the division of Eretz Yisrael. It was not given as a possession to any particular person but belongs to all; therefore the <i>halakha</i> of the heifer whose neck is broken does not apply to it. |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | The Sages taught, | Sotah 45b:5 | § The Talmud returns to discuss when the ritual of breaking the neck of the heifer is performed. <b>A baraita states, </b> expounding the verse “If one be found slain in the land which YHWH your God has given you to possess it, lying in the field” (Deuteronomy 21:1): <b>“Slain”</b> indicates one killed by a sword, <b>but not</b> one who was <b>strangled; “slain, ” but not</b> one who was found <b>twitching</b> in his death throes; <b>“in the land, ” but not concealed in a pile</b> of stones; <b>“lying, ” but not hanging on a tree; “in the field, ” but not floating on the surface of the water. R' Elazar says: In all these</b> cases, <b>if</b> a person <b>was slain</b> by the sword, the judges <b>break the neck</b> of the heifer, and it does not matter where the corpse was found. |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | as it is written: “If one be found | Sotah 45b:7 | § The Mishnah taught: If a corpse <b>was found close to the border</b> of the country <b>or</b> close <b>to a city in which the majority</b> of its inhabitants <b>are non-Jews, </b> the judges would not break the heifer’s neck, <b>as it is written: “If one be found</b> slain” (Deuteronomy 21:1). This <b>excludes</b> places where murdered bodies <b>are</b> commonly <b>found, </b> such as the aforementioned locations. |
| Deuteronomy 21:1 | “It is not known who has smitten him” | Sotah 47b:4 | <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud answers that it is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken: <b>“It is not known who has smitten him”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1). <b>Consequently, </b> if <b>it was known who smote him, even</b> if it was only <b>one</b> person <b>at the end of the world</b> who knew, <b>they would not break the neck</b> of the heifer. <b>R' Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if the members of the <b>Sanhedrin</b> themselves <b>saw one</b> person <b>kill someone, but they do not recognize him, </b> then <b>they would not break the neck</b> of the heifer? <b>The verse states: “Nor did our eyes see”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7), <b>and</b> did they <b>not see? </b> Seeing the murder alone obviates the need for the performance of the ritual. |
| Deuteronomy 21:2 | “And your elders and your judges shall go out | Sanhedrin 14a:13 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>the breaking of the heifer’s neck</b> is performed <b>in</b> front of a panel of <b>three</b> judges, and that R' Yehuda says there must be five judges. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And your elders and your judges shall go out</b> and they shall measure to the cities that are around the corpse” (Deuteronomy 21:2). <b>“Your elders”</b> is in the plural, which indicates a minimum of <b>two, </b> and <b>“your judges”</b> is also plural, indicating another <b>two, and</b> as <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they add an additional one to them, </b> so <b>there are five</b> judges <b>here; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. R' Shimon says: “Your elders, ”</b> indicate <b>two, and</b> as <b>a court may not</b> be composed of <b>an even</b> number of judges, <b>they add an additional one to them, </b> so <b>there are three</b> judges <b>here. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:2 | “And they shall go out,” | Sanhedrin 14a:17 | The Talmud asks: <b>If that is so, </b> if the verbs in the plural form are each understood as adding an additional two judges, then the expression: <b>“And they shall go out, ”</b> in the continuation of the verse (Deuteronomy 21:2) indicates another <b>two, </b> and the expression: <b>“And they shall measure, ”</b> adds another <b>two, </b> meaning that according <b>to R' Yehuda there</b> should be <b>nine</b> judges, and according <b>to R' Shimon, seven. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>He needs this</b> exposition <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And they shall go out, ”</b> to emphasize that <b>they</b> must go out, <b>and not their agents, </b> and the verse states: <b>“And they shall measure, ”</b> to teach that this measurement is itself a mitzva, such <b>that even</b> if the corpse <b>is found</b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:2 | “And your elders and your judges shall go out” | Sanhedrin 14b:2 | § The Talmud comments: <b>The Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </b> With regard to the breaking of the neck of the heifer, the verse states: <b>“And your elders and your judges shall go out”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:2). <b>“Your elders, ” this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanhedrin; “and your judges, ” this</b> is referring to the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest. </b> The <i>baraita</i> explains the assertion that the <b>king</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written: “The king by justice establishes the land”</b> (Proverbs 29:4), and the <b>High Priest</b> is also called a judge, <b>as it is written: “And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge</b> that will be in those days” (Deuteronomy 17:9), referring to the High Priest. |
| Deuteronomy 21:2 | “And they shall measure” | Sotah 45a:1 | because <b>he does not learn</b> anything from the letter <b><i>vav</i>. </b> Rather, <b>what is God saying</b> in the Torah with the phrase “and your judges”? He is referring to <b>the distinguished that are among your judges. </b> The Talmud raises an objection: <b>However, if that is so, </b> if every plural form in the verse adds another two judges, then when it later states: <b>“And they shall go out, ”</b> this should indicate another <b>two. </b> And: <b>“And they shall measure”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:2), should indicate yet another <b>two. </b> This means that <b>according to</b> the reasoning of <b>R' Yehuda there are nine</b> judges enumerated <b>here, </b> while <b>according to</b> the reasoning of <b>R' Shimon there are seven</b> judges enumerated <b>here. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:2 | writes “slain” an extra | Sotah 45b:6 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei bar Yehuda says</b> that the rabbis <b>said to R' Elazar: Do you not concede that if he was strangled and left in a garbage</b> heap, <b>that they do not break the</b> heifer’s <b>neck? Apparently, “slain”</b> is a precise term that means slain <b>but not strangled. </b> If you accept that, <b>here too</b> the words <b>“in the land”</b> should indicate: In the land, <b>but not concealed in a pile</b> of stones; <b>“fallen”</b> should indicate: Fallen <b>but not hanging on a tree; </b> and <b>“in the field”</b> should indicate in the field <b>but not floating on the surface of the water. And R' Elazar</b> holds that those other situations are not excluded, and that because in that first case the Torah <b>writes “slain” an extra</b> time in the next verse: “About him that is slain” (Deuteronomy 21:2), this repetition teaches that a victim of strangulation is not included in this <i>halakha</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | with it, | Avodah Zarah23a:6 | The Talmud rejects this conclusion: <b>From where</b> do you know that this is the case? <b>Perhaps everyone</b> agrees that <b>we are not concerned that</b> a person might have engaged in <b>bestiality</b> with the animal, <b>and here, this is the reasoning of R' Eliezer: </b> He holds <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>that R' Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says. As R' Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> If <b>one placed a bundle of sacks upon</b> a red heifer, <b>he has rendered it unfit</b> for purification, as a red heifer is fit only if it has not borne any burden, in accordance with the verse: “Upon which never came a yoke” (Numbers 19:2); <b>and in</b> the case of the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken, it is not rendered unfit <b>until you pull</b> a load <b>with it, </b> as the verse states: “And which has not drawn in the yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa says | Bava Metzia30a:10 | The difference is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa says</b> with regard to the verse written concerning the heifer whose neck is broken: “And the Elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd that has not been worked with and that has not pulled a yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>If</b> the word <b>were written</b> with an additional letter <i>vav</i>, which would mean the passive: <b>Has been worked with [<i>ubbad</i>], and we</b> also <b>vocalized</b> the word in the passive voice, <b><i>ubbad</i>, I would say</b> that <b>even</b> if the heifer performed labor <b>by itself, </b> it is disqualified for use in the ritual. <b>If</b> the word <b>were written</b> without an additional letter <i>vav</i>, which would mean the active: <b>He used it for labor [<i>avad</i>], and we</b> also <b>vocalized</b> the word in the active voice, <b><i>avad</i>, I would say</b> that indicates that the heifer was fit for use in the ritual <b>until</b> its owner intentionally <b>used it for labor. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | that has not been worked with | Bava Metzia30a:7 | The Talmud rejects this proof by citing a verse written with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken. It <b>is different there, as the verse states: </b> “The Elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd <b>that has not been worked with</b> and that has not pulled a yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3), indicating that the heifer is rendered unfit <b>in any case</b> of labor performed. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn with regard to spreading the garment. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | nearest | Bekhorot 17b:7 | Is it <b>not because</b> R' Eliezer <b>holds: </b> With regard to matters that are <b>in human hands, </b> it is <b>possible</b> for two matters <b>to coincide precisely? And</b> R' Eliezer also holds that when the verse states, in the singular: “And it shall be that the town which is <b>nearest</b> to the slain man, even the elders of that town shall take a heifer of the herd” (Deuteronomy 21:3), it is not necessarily referring to only one town, but <b>even to</b> the two <b>nearest</b> towns, if they are equidistant from the corpse. If it were impossible for both towns to be measured as precisely the same distance from the corpse, they would not bring two heifers but one in partnership, stipulating that it belongs to the town that is actually closer. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | “Taking [ kiḥa ]” | Chullin 82a:7 | His reasoning is that he <b>derives</b> it via verbal analogy <b>from</b> the terms: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), with regard to the birds, and: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), with regard to the <b>heifer whose neck is broken. </b> Consequently, just as deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited from the time of its selection, so too must deriving benefit from these birds be prohibited from the time of their selection. Clearly, then, R' Shimon ben Lakish holds that deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive. Therefore, its slaughter is one that does not render the animal fit for consumption. Accordingly, R' Shimon would exempt its slaughterer from the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, as is taught in the Mishnah. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | Rav Pappa said | Pesachim 26b:2 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the verse says: “And the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been used for work, and which has not drawn in the yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>If it were written: “He worked [<i>avad</i>], ” and we read: “He worked [<i>avad</i>], ”</b> this word choice would indicate that the heifer could still be used <b>until he, </b> the owner of the heifer himself, <b>used it</b> willingly for labor. <b>If it were written: “It was worked [<i>ubbad</i>], ” and we read: “It was worked [<i>ubbad</i>], ”</b> it would indicate that <b>even</b> if it performed labor <b>on its own it is also</b> prohibited to use it, since some form of labor had been done with it. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | “That is nearest” | Sotah 45b:11 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud explains: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Eliezer, </b> that when a body is found precisely between two cities, the inhabitants of each city bring a heifer? His ruling is based on two factors. First, <b>he holds</b> that <b>it is possible to measure precisely</b> and that it is a real possibility to determine that both cities are exactly the same distance from the corpse. <b>And</b> second, he interprets the term <b>“That is nearest”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), to be referring not only to one city. It can <b>even</b> be understood as: <b>That are nearest, </b> so that the <i>halakhot</i> apply to more than one city. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | requires “the Elders of that city” | Sotah 45b:8 | The Mishnah taught: <b>Or</b> if the victim was discovered close <b>to a city that is without</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, they would not measure the distance to that city. The Talmud explains: This is <b>because</b> the verse <b>requires “the Elders of that city”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> the case here; therefore the rite was not performed. The Mishnah also taught that the Elders <b>measure</b> the distance from the corpse <b>only to a city</b> that contains a rabbinical court of twenty-three judges. The Talmud asks: This <b>is obvious. Since</b> the Mishnah <b>taught</b> that they do not measure the distance <b>to a city that does not have</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, <b>I know</b> that <b>they measure</b> the distance <b>only to a city that has</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | The verse states: “And the Elders of that city shall take” | Sotah 45b:9 | The Talmud answers: <b>This</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the corpse <b>was found close to a city that does not have</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, <b>that they leave</b> the city aside <b>and measure</b> the distance from the corpse <b>to a city that has</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges? <b>The verse states: “And the Elders of that city shall take”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), which indicates that the Elders of a city are involved <b>in any case, </b> and the measurement is taken even if it is not to the city closest to the body. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | “yoke” | Sotah 46a:12 | <b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is unsound, you can learn this <i>halakha</i> by a verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here, </b> with regard to the red heifer, <b>“yoke”</b> (Numbers 19:2), <b>and it is stated there, </b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>“yoke”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>Just as there, other</b> types of <b>labor disqualify it, so too here, </b> in the case of the red heifer, <b>other</b> types of <b>labor disqualify</b> it. |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | verse states: “That has not been worked with” | Sotah 46a:18 | The Talmud comments: <b>And a case like this is also taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a heifer</b> whose neck is broken: From the word <b>“yoke” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a yoke</b> disqualifies; <b>from where</b> do I derive the <b>other</b> types of <b>labor? The</b> same <b>verse states: “That has not been worked with”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), to teach that it is disqualified <b>in any case, </b> no matter what labor was performed with it. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “yoke”? </b> It serves to teach us that <b>a yoke</b> placed on the animal <b>disqualifies</b> it <b>whether</b> the yoke was on the animal <b>at the time of</b> performing <b>labor or whether</b> it was on the animal <b>not at the time of performing labor, </b> i.e., it was merely placed on the animal, whereas <b>other</b> types of <b>labor</b> actions <b>disqualify</b> animals <b>only at the time of</b> actually performing <b>labor. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:3 | until it pulls | Sotah 46a:4 | <b>Why, </b> then, does <b>Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> If <b>he placed a bundle [<i>uda</i>] of sacks on</b> a red heifer<b>, </b>the heifer is immediately <b>disqualified</b> from being used as the red heifer; <b>and</b> as <b>for the heifer</b> whose neck is broken, it is not disqualified by such labor <b>until it pulls</b> and moves the burden, as the verse states: “That has not pulled a yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). Why does bearing the weight of the bundle disqualify the red heifer? The Talmud explains: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the red <b>heifer is different, as we learn</b> by a verbal analogy between the word <b>“yoke”</b> used with regard to the red heifer and the word <b>“yoke”</b> used with regard <b>to</b> the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken that any labor disqualifies the former. |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley” | Avodah Zarah29b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive the prohibition of <b>a corpse itself? </b> The Talmud answers: It <b>is derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the words <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there”</b> employed <b>with regard to</b> the <b>heifer whose neck is broken</b> to absolve a city from bearing responsibility for the death of a visitor. <b>It is written here: “And Miriam died there”</b> (Numbers 20:1), <b>and it is written there: </b> “And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, <b>and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). <b>Just as there, </b> deriving <b>benefit from</b> the heifer <b>is prohibited, so too here, </b> deriving <b>benefit from</b> a corpse is <b>prohibited. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | the verse states: “And shall break the neck of the heifer | Chullin 24a:6 | The Talmud challenges: <b>And let it be</b> derived that the heifer whose neck is broken is rendered <b>fit with slaughter by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> a red <b>heifer, which is not rendered fit with breaking the neck, </b> is rendered <b>fit with slaughter, </b> then with regard to <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>which</b> is rendered <b>fit with breaking the neck, isn’t it logical that it is rendered fit with slaughter? </b> The Talmud responds that <b>the verse states: “And shall break the neck of the heifer</b> there in the valley” (Deuteronomy 21:4). The doubled reference to breaking the neck in the two verses indicates that <b>by breaking the neck, yes, </b> the heifer may be killed; <b>by slaughter, </b> the heifer may <b>not</b> be killed. |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | “And they shall break the heifer’s neck in the valley” | Keritot 6a:13 | The Talmud answers: One cannot derive a general principle from this case, <b>because the removal of the ashes and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken, </b> from which one may not derive benefit after that rite has been performed, are <b>two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is</b> the case of <b>the removal of the ashes? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This <b>teaches that they require interment. What is</b> the case of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And they shall break the heifer’s neck in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). This <b>teaches that</b> such heifers <b>require interment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | the elders of that city | Makkot 10b:19 | <b>And a city in which there are no elders</b> is the subject of another dispute between <b>R' Ami and R' Asi. One says: </b> If a corpse was discovered proximate to that city, the inhabitants of the city <b>bring a heifer whose neck is broken. And one says: </b> The inhabitants of the city <b>do not bring a heifer whose neck is broken. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>According to the one who says</b> that the inhabitants of the city <b>do not bring a heifer whose neck is broken, </b> it is due to the fact that <b>we require</b> the presence of the elders of the city, as it is written: “And <b>the elders of that city</b> shall bring the calf down to a rough valley” (Deuteronomy 21:4), <b>and there are no</b> elders. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the inhabitants of the city <b>bring a heifer whose neck is broken, </b> the presence of the elders is <b>merely a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | which will be neither plowed nor sown” | Makkot 22a:5 | <b>Rav Hoshaya objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate</b> in his list the prohibition of <b>sowing in a forceful stream, </b> the land where a heifer’s neck is broken by the Elders of the city closest to the corpse of a murder victim whose murderer is unknown, <b>and its prohibition is from here: </b> “And the Elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a forceful stream, <b>which will be neither plowed nor sown”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). The verse is written in the future tense as a prohibition for the future: It is prohibited to work the land there after the heifer’s neck is broken. |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | “Which may be neither worked nor sown” | Sotah 46b:3 | § The Mishnah taught further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>its place, </b> it <b>is prohibited</b> for that ground <b>to be sown or to be worked. A baraita states: </b> The verse: <b>“Which may be neither worked nor sown”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4) is referring <b>to the past, </b> that is, a place which has not previously been worked or sown. This is <b>the statement of R' Yoshiya. R' Yonatan says: </b> It speaks <b>of the future, </b> meaning it is prohibited to sow or work the land from that point onward. |
| Deuteronomy 21:4 | killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [ arefu ] there in the valley” | Taanit 7a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Bena’a would say: Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18), <b>and it says: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8), <b>and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). <b>And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake, </b> e.g., for self-aggrandizement, his Torah <b>will be an elixir of death for him, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain, ” and <i>arifa</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [<i>arefu</i>] there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). |
| Deuteronomy 21:5 | “And according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be” | Bekhorot 35b:16 | § <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: According to R' Meir, who says that</b> a priest <b>who is suspect about the matter</b> of causing a blemish may <b>neither adjudicate nor testify</b> in cases involving that matter even on behalf of another, <b>and</b> in addition <b>R' Meir says</b> that <b>one who is suspected of</b> transgressing <b>one matter, </b> i.e., who is known to have committed one transgression, <b>is suspected of</b> transgressing <b>the entire Torah, </b> it should follow that <b>priests</b> should <b>also not</b> be allowed to <b>administer judgment</b> at all. <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“And according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5)? |
| Deuteronomy 21:5 | “And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near” | Gittin 59b:7 | <b>R' Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here, </b> as it is written: <b>“And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5). The Talmud asks: <b>Is that to say I do not know that the priests are the sons of Levi? Rather, </b> the Torah was first given to the priests and afterward to the other Levites, and from this we learn that <b>first a priest</b> reads from the Torah, <b>and after</b> him <b>a Levite. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:5 | the verse states: “According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous mark be” | Niddah 50a:1 | <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>R' Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous mark be”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5)? <b>What do disputes have to do with leprous marks? </b> The verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous marks, </b> to teach that <b>just as leprous marks</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written</b> with regard to leprous marks: <b>“And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too, disputes</b> are adjudicated only <b>in the daytime. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:5 | “According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous sore be” | Sanhedrin 34b:10 | The Talmud comments: <b>The Mishnah is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Meir. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous sore be”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5)? <b>And what do disputes have to do with leprous sores? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | it is written: “Whose neck was broken” | Chullin 117b:1 | <b>exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here, </b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. <b>There, </b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). This superfluous description teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others. |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | whose neck was broken, | Chullin 11a:13 | <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: </b> The principle of following a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>heifer whose neck is broken</b> when a person is found killed in an area that is between two cities and the murderer is unknown (Deuteronomy 21:1–9). <b>As God states: </b> “And all the elders of that city…shall wash their hands over the heifer <b>whose neck was broken, </b> in the valley” (Deuteronomy 21:6), from which it is inferred: Other than its neck being broken, the heifer <b>should remain</b> in a state <b>where it is whole. And</b> if one does not follow the majority, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>? |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | whose neck is broken” | Chullin 24a:5 | The Talmud explains: Actually, one may learn an <i>a fortiori</i> inference even in a case where statute is written. Nevertheless, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>God restricts</b> the use of breaking the neck: “And all the Elders of that city…shall wash their hands over the heifer <b>whose neck is broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). From the relative pronoun “whose” it is derived: <b>This</b> heifer <b>is</b> killed <b>by breaking the neck, but no other, </b> i.e., the red heifer, is killed <b>by breaking the neck. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | that had its neck broken” | Keritot 6a:14 | The Talmud adds: <b>And</b> even <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>two verses that come as one</b> do <b>teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases, <b>here they certainly do not teach</b> that misuse of consecrated property applies to items whose mitzva has been performed. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>there are two</b> terms indicating <b>exclusions</b> with regard to these <i>halakhot</i>, limiting this <i>halakha</i> to those cases. <b>With regard to the removal of the ashes it is written: “And he shall put it. ”</b> The word “it” teaches that in <b>this</b> particular case, <b>yes, </b> there is misuse of consecrated property, but with regard to any <b>other matter</b> this prohibition does <b>not</b> apply. <b>With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken it is written: “The</b> heifer <b>that had its neck broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that with regard to the heifer that <b>had its neck broken, yes, </b> but with regard to any <b>other matter</b> the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property does <b>not</b> apply. |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | it is written: “The one whose neck was broken” | Meilah 11b:9 | The Talmud explains: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to them. <b>There, </b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “The one whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), and the definite article indicates that this <i>halakha</i> should not be extended to other cases. |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | which had its neck broken” | Pesachim 26a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>they do not teach</b> a principle, i.e., according to the Rabbis. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>they do teach</b> a principle, i.e., R' Yehuda in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <b>what can be said? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Two</b> phrases indicating <b>exclusions are written</b> with regard to these <i>halakhot</i>, limiting this rule to them. With regard to the removal of ashes <b>it is written: “And he shall put it. ”</b> The word “it” limits the <i>halakha</i> to this particular circumstance. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken <b>it is written: “The</b> heifer <b>which had its neck broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to this type of heifer and not to any other similar case. |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | “And all the Elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley” | Sotah 46b:8 | § The Mishnah taught that <b>the Elders of the city</b> would then <b>wash their hands. A baraita states: </b> With regard to the verse: <b>“And all the Elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), one might have thought <b>that</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Whose neck was broken, ”</b> because there is no heifer mentioned other than the one whose neck was broken. <b>And what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Whose neck was broken”? </b> It serves to teach us that they wash their hands <b>over the place where the heifer’s neck was broken. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | “Whose neck was broken” | Yoma 60a:5 | The Talmud challenges this reply from a different angle: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common feature to other cases, <b>but according to the one who says that two verses that come as one</b> do <b>teach</b> with regard to other cases, <b>what is there to say? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. With respect to the removal of ashes, it states: <b>“And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), implying “it” and nothing else. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, it is written: <b>“Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), which teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies solely to this case. |
| Deuteronomy 21:6 | it is written: “Whose neck was broken” | Zevachim 46a:12 | The Talmud answers: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here, </b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), and this superfluous description teaches that this <i>halakha</i>, that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva, applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others. <b>And there, </b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. |
| Deuteronomy 21:7 | As it is stated: “And they shall speak and say: Our hands have not shed this blood” | Sotah 38b:14 | <b>As it is stated: “And they shall speak and say: Our hands have not shed this blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7). <b>But did it enter our hearts</b> to think <b>that the Elders of the court are murderers? </b> Why it is necessary for them to publicize that they did not kill him? <b>Rather, </b> they must declare: It is <b>not</b> so that this victim <b>came to us and we dismissed him, and</b> it is <b>not</b> so that <b>we saw him and left him. </b> In other words, <b>he did not come to us and we</b> in turn <b>dismissed him without food, </b> and <b>we did not see him and</b> then <b>leave him without an escort. </b> It is miserly people who do not provide others with food and cause them to travel to places where they might be murdered. |
| Deuteronomy 21:7 | “And they shall speak and say” | Sotah 44b:13 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the first sentence in the Mishnah <b>saying? </b> The Mishnah is attempting to prove that the verses read during the ritual of breaking a heifer’s neck are to be recited in Hebrew, yet the verse does not offer any proof of this. <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the Mishnah <b>is saying: </b> The confession is recited in Hebrew, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the ritual of the heifer whose neck is broken: <b>“And they shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7), <b>and later it is stated</b> with regard to the curses stated on Mount Ebal: <b>“And the Levities shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as</b> the word <b>“speak” that is said later</b> with regard to the Levites is referring to a speech that <b>is</b> recited <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here</b> the declaration is recited <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:7 | place of the breaking of the neck of the heifer, and they would recite: “Our hands did not spill this blood, nor did our eyes see” | Sotah 45b:20 | <b>The Elders of that city</b> would then <b>wash their hands in water in</b> the <b>place of the breaking of the neck of the heifer, and they would recite: “Our hands did not spill this blood, nor did our eyes see”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7). The Mishnah explains: <b>But did it enter our minds that the Elders of the court are spillers of blood, </b> that they must make such a declaration? <b>Rather, </b> they mean to declare <b>that</b> the victim <b>did not come to us and</b> then <b>we let him take his leave without food, and we did not see him and</b> then <b>leave him</b> alone to depart <b>without accompaniment. </b> They therefore attest that they took care of all his needs and are not responsible for his death even indirectly. |
| Deuteronomy 21:7 | “And they shall say: Our hands did not spill this blood, nor did our eyes see” | Sotah 46b:9 | The verse further states: <b>“And they shall say: Our hands did not spill this blood, nor did our eyes see”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7). The Mishnah explains: <b>But did it enter our minds that</b> the Elders of <b>the court are spillers of blood, </b> that they must make such a declaration? <b>Rather, </b> they mean to declare: The victim <b>did not come to us and</b> then <b>we let him take his leave without food, and we did not see him and</b> then <b>leave him</b> alone to depart <b>without accompaniment. </b> They therefore attest that they took care of all his needs and are not responsible for his death even indirectly. |
| Deuteronomy 21:7 | The verse states: “Nor did our eyes see” | Sotah 47b:4 | <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud answers that it is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken: <b>“It is not known who has smitten him”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1). <b>Consequently, </b> if <b>it was known who smote him, even</b> if it was only <b>one</b> person <b>at the end of the world</b> who knew, <b>they would not break the neck</b> of the heifer. <b>R' Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if the members of the <b>Sanhedrin</b> themselves <b>saw one</b> person <b>kill someone, but they do not recognize him, </b> then <b>they would not break the neck</b> of the heifer? <b>The verse states: “Nor did our eyes see”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7), <b>and</b> did they <b>not see? </b> Seeing the murder alone obviates the need for the performance of the ritual. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | atonement is written with regard to | Avodah Zarah29b:13 | <b>And there, from where do we</b> learn that deriving benefit from the heifer is prohibited? The rabbis <b>said in the school of R' Yannai: </b> A term of <b>atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer whose neck is broken (Deuteronomy 21:8), just <b>as</b> it is written with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals. This teaches that deriving benefit from the heifer is prohibited, just as deriving benefit from sacrificial animals is prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | “Atone for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, Lord” | Horayot 6a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>Are</b> these matters <b>comparable? </b> In the case of <b>the goat of the New Moon, perhaps no</b> one <b>from</b> the <b>public died</b> in the interim. <b>But here, </b> in the case of those who returned to Zion from Babylonia, those who engaged in idol worship in the days of Zedekiah <b>certainly died, </b> as many years have passed since then. <b>Rather, the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa is from here, as it is written</b> in the confession recited by the rabbis during the rite of the heifer whose neck is broken: <b>“Atone for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:8). <b>This atonement is fit to atone</b> even <b>for those who emerged from Egypt, from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “Whom You have redeemed. ”</b> The reference is to those whom God redeemed from Egypt, even though they died long ago. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | Your people Israel, | Keritot 26a:18 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> another answer: <b>The verse states</b> that the priests at the ceremony of the heifer whose neck is broken should recite the following sentence: <b>“Forgive, </b> Lord, <b>Your people Israel, </b> whom You have redeemed” (Deuteronomy 21:8). The verse indicates that <b>this atonement, </b> which is achieved through the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>is</b> also <b>fit to atone</b> retroactively <b>for those who left Egypt, </b> i.e., every case of unknown murder that occurred since the Jews left Egypt. It can be inferred from here that Yom Kippur of previous years have not atoned for those past murders. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | atonement was written with regard to it. | Kiddushin 57a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a heifer whose neck is broken, </b> she is not betrothed. The Talmud clarifies: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a heifer whose neck is broken? <b>The school of R' Yannai said: </b> An expression of <b>atonement was written with regard to it. </b> The verse: “Atone for Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 21:8), was written with regard to a heifer whose neck was broken, <b>as</b> was also written with regard to <b>sacrificial animals. </b> Therefore, one is prohibited from deriving benefit from it, just as one may not benefit from an offering. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | And the priests recite: “Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Your people Israel” | Sotah 46a:1 | <b>And the priests recite: “Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Your people Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:8). <b>They did not have to recite</b> the conclusion of the verse: <b>“And the blood shall be forgiven for them, ”</b> as this is not part of the priests’ statement, <b>but</b> rather <b>the Holy Spirit informs them: When you shall do so, the blood is forgiven for you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken: “Atone, | Yoma 37a:1 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that the confession must begin with the word <b>please? It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated there, </b> just before Moses’s plea following the sin of the Golden Calf <b>at Horeb: </b> “Perhaps I may secure <b>atonement</b> for your sin” (Exodus 32:30). <b>Just as there, </b> the prayer includes: <b>“Please, </b> this people is guilty of a great sin” (Exodus 32:31), <b>so too here, </b> the term <b>please</b> should be used. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the Yom Kippur confession includes <b>the name</b> of God? <b>It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken: “Atone, </b> O God, for Your nation of Israel whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among Your people Israel, and they will be atoned of bloodguilt” (Deuteronomy 21:8). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to the heifer, <b>the name</b> of God is mentioned, <b>so too here, the name</b> of God is mentioned. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | for Your nation, Israel” | Yoma 37a:2 | <b>Abaye said: Granted, </b> the obligation to include the name of God in the confession at <b>Horeb cannot be derived from the heifer whose neck is broken, </b> since <b>what was, was. </b> The sin of the Golden Calf predated the mitzva of the heifer. <b>However, you</b> should <b>derive</b> that the confession in the ritual of the <b>heifer whose neck is broken</b> requires use of the term: Please, <b>from Horeb, </b> where Moses employed that term. <b>And if you say that is so, </b> and the term: Please, should be employed, <b>didn’t we learn</b> in a Mishnah that <b>the priests say: “Atone, </b> O God, <b>for Your nation, Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:8), <b>while</b> the Mishnah <b>does not state</b> the term <b>please. </b> Apparently, the formula of confession during the ritual of the heifer is not derived from Horeb. The Talmud says: It is indeed <b>difficult</b> why that is not derived. |
| Deuteronomy 21:8 | atonement is written with regard to | Zevachim 70b:7 | <b>Rav Dimi was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>, </b> i.e., this dilemma. <b>Abaye said to him: By inference</b> from this dilemma, it seems that you assume that <b>a heifer whose neck is broken is</b> itself <b>pure</b> and does not impart impurity as would a carcass. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: Indeed, </b> as the rabbis <b>of the school of R' Yannai say: </b> Since the language of <b>atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer whose neck is broken, in the verse: “Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 21:8), just <b>as</b> atonement is written with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, the breaking of the heifer’s neck is equivalent to the pinching of the nape of a bird offering, and breaking its neck prevents the heifer from imparting ritual impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 21:9 | “And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst” | Ketubot 37b:7 | The Talmud asks: What about the following verse, from the conclusion of the chapter of the heifer: The verse <b>“And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:9) appears to be teaching the very same <i>halakha</i>, that a murderer must be executed. <b>Why do I</b> need it? The Talmud answers that <b>it is necessary to</b> teach <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to <b>those executed by sword, </b> e.g., murderers, their execution <b>is</b> administered <b>from the neck, </b> and nowhere else? <b>The verse states: “And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:9), <b>likening all spillers of blood to the beheaded calf</b> brought for an unresolved murder. <b>Just as there, </b> the calf is beheaded <b>from the neck, so too, murderers</b> are beheaded <b>from the neck. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:9 | “And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst” | Sanhedrin 52b:19 | The Talmud answers: The Mishnah <b>derives it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:9), that <b>all spillers of blood are compared to the heifer whose neck is broken</b> as atonement for an unresolved murder. <b>Just as there, </b> the heifer is killed <b>by</b> the <b>sword and at the neck, so too here, </b> murderers are executed <b>by</b> the <b>sword and at the neck. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:10 | and you take them captive” | Sotah 35b:13 | <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and YHWH your God delivers them into your hands, <b>and you take them captive”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:10), implying that there is no obligation to destroy them, <b>to include</b> not only non-Jews who are not Canaanites, but even <b>Canaanites that are</b> living <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as, if they repent, they are accepted</b> and allowed to live in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 21:11 | “And see among the captives | Kiddushin 21b:20 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this dispute. <b>With regard to the second act of sex everyone agrees that it is prohibited, as she is a convert, </b> and a priest may not marry a convert. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to the first act of sex.

| Deuteronomy 21:11 | “And you have a desire | Kiddushin 22a:1 | <b>of dying animals</b> that were <b>slaughtered, and let them not eat the meat of dying animals</b> that were not slaughtered but which will become <b>carcasses. </b> In other words, it is preferable for this act to be performed in a somewhat permitted way rather than in a manner that is entirely prohibited. The expression: <b>“And you have a desire</b> for her and would take her to you as a wife” (Deuteronomy 21:11), teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if she is not pretty, </b> as this is a subjective judgment dependent on one’s desire. The term <b>“for her”</b> indicates that he may take her, <b>but not her and another</b> woman. A soldier is allowed to take only one captive in this manner. |
| Deuteronomy 21:12 | that one can read with regard to it: “Then you shall bring her home to your house” | Kiddushin 21b:20 | <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this dispute. <b>With regard to the second act of sex everyone agrees that it is prohibited, as she is a convert, </b> and a priest may not marry a convert. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to the first act of sex.

| Deuteronomy 21:12 | “Then you shall bring her | Kiddushin 22a:2 | The phrase <b>“and would take her”</b> teaches: <b>You have</b> the ability to <b>take her, </b> i.e., to marry her. <b>“To you as a wife”</b> teaches <b>that he may not take two women, one for him and one for his father, </b> or <b>one for him and one for his son. </b> The verse: <b>“Then you shall bring her</b> home into your house” (Deuteronomy 21:12), <b>teaches that he should not pressure her</b> to have sex <b>during the war, </b> but he should first take her into his home. |
| Deuteronomy 21:12 | “And she shall shave her head and do her nails” | Yevamot 48a:9 | § Having cited it above, the Talmud focuses on the case of the beautiful female prisoner of war: <b>A baraita states: </b> The verse states: <b>“And she shall shave her head and do her nails”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:12). The phrase “do her nails” is ambiguous. <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> It means <b>she cuts</b> her nails. <b>R' Akiva says: </b> It means <b>she grows</b> them. |
| Deuteronomy 21:13 | “And after that you may go in to her and be her husband, | Kiddushin 68b:8 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a beautiful captive woman: <b>“And after that you may go in to her and be her husband, </b> and she shall be your wife” (Deuteronomy 21:13). One can derive from here <b>by inference that at the outset, </b> before she became a Jew, <b>betrothal would not take effect with her, </b> despite the fact that he had already brought her into his house, and according to some opinions, had even had sex with her. |
| Deuteronomy 21:13 | “And she shall bewail her father and her mother | Yevamot 48a:12 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And she shall bewail her father and her mother</b> a month of days and after that you may come to her” (Deuteronomy 21:13). |
| Deuteronomy 21:13 | “A month of days | Yevamot 48b:2 | The verses states: <b>“A month of days</b> and after that you may come to her” (Deuteronomy 21:13). This means <b>a thirty-day month. R' Shimon ben Elazar says: </b> She must wait <b>ninety days. </b> This is derived as follows: The phrase <b>“a month”</b> connotes <b>thirty</b> days; the word <b>“days”</b> adds another <b>thirty</b> days; <b>and</b> the words <b>“after that”</b> indicate another period equal to one previously mentioned, i.e., a further <b>thirty</b> days. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | As the verse states: “And if the firstborn son was [ vehaya ] hers that was hated” | Bava Batra126b:13 | § <b>R' Ami says: </b> In the case of <b>one whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>]</b> and <b>whose</b> skin <b>became perforated</b> so that his genitals were exposed <b>and</b> he <b>was found</b> to be <b>a male, </b> he <b>does not take a double</b> portion of his father’s estate. <b>As the verse states: “And if the firstborn son was [<i>vehaya</i>] hers that was hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that he is not considered a firstborn <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son, </b> i.e., male, <b>from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being [<i>havaya</i>], </b> i.e., his birth. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | “And they have borne him sons” | Bava Batra127a:1 | <b>Ameimar says: </b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>also does not reduce the</b> additional <b>portion of the firstborn. </b> His portion is not taken into account in the calculation of the firstborn’s additional portion. For example, if there are three brothers: A firstborn, an ordinary brother, and a <i>tumtum</i>, the firstborn receives one-3rd of the property as his additional portion, as he would if he and the ordinary brother were the only heirs, and the remaining two-thirds are divided among all three brothers. This is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the portion of the firstborn: <b>“And they have borne him sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that the brother of a firstborn does not affect his additional portion <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son at the moment of</b> his <b>birth. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | of Rabbi Ami | Bava Batra127a:8 | <b>Rava says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R' Ami</b> that a <i>tumtum</i> firstborn does not receive a double portion of the inheritance. The <i>baraita</i> states: From the phrase “the firstborn son” (Deuteronomy 21:15) it is derived that only <b>a son</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i>, </b> and only a definite <b>firstborn</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not</b> one about whom it is <b>uncertain</b> if he is a firstborn. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | and they bore him children, | Bava Batra142b:3 | <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: </b> The Mishnah comes <b>to say that</b> a one-day-old child <b>reduces the portion of the firstborn. </b> The firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, and this is calculated taking into account the portion due to his dead brother. <b>And</b> it is in this context that <b>specifically</b> the portion of <b>a one-day-old</b> child is taken into account, <b>but</b> the portion of <b>a fetus is not</b> taken into account, even though a fetus also inherits property. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>God states</b> concerning the portion of the firstborn: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, <b>and they bore him children, </b> both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15). The term “children” excludes a fetus. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | “And they have borne him | Bekhorot 47b:13 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that neither a son born by caesarean section nor the son who follows him are firstborn, neither with regard to inheritance nor with regard to redemption from a priest. The Talmud explains: The <b>first</b> son, born by caesarean section, is <b>not</b> considered the firstborn <b>with regard to inheritance, </b> as <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And they have borne him</b> children” (Deuteronomy 21:15), written in the context of inheritance, and a caesarean section is not called a birth. Likewise, <b>with regard to</b> the redemption with <b>five <i>sela</i></b> coins, this son is <b>also not</b> considered the firstborn, as <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “Whatever <b>opens the womb”</b> (Exodus 13:2), and he did not open his mother’s womb. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | rather than establishing | Kiddushin 68a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis, </b> who disagree with R' Akiva’s opinion, <b>rather than establishing</b> the verse: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the one hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15), as referring <b>to</b> those who are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions, let them establish it</b> as referring <b>to those liable for</b> violating <b>a positive mitzva. </b> In other words, betrothal should not be effective if it involves the violation of a prohibition. And as for the “hated” woman whose marriage is nevertheless valid, mentioned in that verse, this is referring to one whose having sex violates a positive mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | “If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the one hated” | Kiddushin 68a:4 | Rav Pappa says: It <b>is written explicitly</b> in the Torah that a man can betroth women <b>with whom he is liable</b> for violating ordinary <b>prohibitions</b> of sex. The Torah states in a different context: <b>“If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the one hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15). Rav Pappa asks rhetorically: <b>But is there one who is hated before God and one who is beloved before God? Rather, “beloved”</b> means <b>beloved in her marriage, </b> i.e., her marriage is permitted; <b>“hated”</b> means <b>hated in her marriage, </b> i.e., her marriage involves the violation of a prohibition. <b>And</b> despite the fact that the latter marriage is between a man and a woman who are forbidden to one another, their union still has the status of a marriage, as <b>God states: “If a man has</b> two wives,” i.e., he is married to both of them. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | Rabbi Yeshevav if he comes to exclude the reason of Rabbi Simai, | Kiddushin 68a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> what can be said <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yeshevav, who says: Come, let us shout at Akiva ben Yosef, who would say: </b> In <b>every</b> case where <b>a Jew may not have sex</b> with a particular woman, and he does so, <b>the offspring</b> that results from this union <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>, </b> even the child of a widow and a High Priest? <b>This works out well</b> even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yeshevav if he comes to exclude the reason of R' Simai, </b> i.e., if he means to take issue with the ruling of R' Akiva in the specific case mentioned by R' Simai, that of a widow married to a High Priest, then R' Yeshevav too concedes that according to the opinion of R' Akiva, betrothal does take effect in a case where a positive mitzva is violated by the betrothal. Accordingly, one can establish the phrase “and the one hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15) as referring to those whose marriage entailed the violation of a positive mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | and they have borne him | Kiddushin 68b:9 | The Talmud asks another question: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her child is like her? </b> The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “If a man has</b> two wives, the one beloved and the one hated, <b>and they have borne him</b> children” (Deuteronomy 21:15), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we read: “If he has, ”</b> i.e., that a woman can be betrothed, <b>we</b> also <b>read: “And they have borne him, ”</b> meaning that their children follow his lineage. <b>And anywhere that we do not read: “If he has, ” we</b> likewise <b>do not read: “And they have borne him, ”</b> as the offspring inherit their mother’s status. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | and they bore him children” | Niddah 44b:3 | <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, said</b> a different explanation of the Mishnah’s ruling <b>in the name of Rava: </b> The Mishnah teaches that a one-day-old baby inherits in order <b>to say that</b> such a child <b>reduces the portion of the firstborn. </b> A firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, which is calculated by taking into account the portion due to his dead brother. <b>And Mar, son of Rav Yosef, </b> further <b>said in the name of Rava: A son who was born after his father’s death does not reduce the portion of the firstborn. </b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> in the Mishnah does not apply to a fetus. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, <b>and they bore him children”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), and this does not apply to a fetus not yet born at the time of the father’s death. |
| Deuteronomy 21:15 | which it is written: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated” | Yevamot 23a:2 | This is derived from the verse in <b>which it is written: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15). <b>Is there one</b> who is <b>loved by God and one</b> who is <b>hated by God? Rather, “beloved”</b> means <b>her marriage is beloved, </b> as it was permitted for her to be married, in accordance with <i>halakha</i>, and <b>“hated”</b> means <b>her marriage is hated</b> because it was not permitted for her to be married, according to <i>halakha</i>. <b>And God states: “If</b> a man <b>has</b> two wives,” meaning that both are considered to be married. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | “Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit | Bava Batra113b:3 | § <b>Rabba bar Ḥanina taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: </b> A verse in the passage concerning the double portion inherited by a firstborn states: <b>“Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit</b> that which he has” (Deuteronomy 21:16). The addition of the phrase “on the day” teaches that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>during the day</b> that <b>you may distribute inheritances, but you may not distribute inheritances at night. Abaye said to him: </b> That cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as, <b>if that is so, </b> it ought to be <b>that</b> only <b>one who dies during the day is</b> the one from <b>whom his children inherit, </b> but with regard to <b>one who dies at night, his children do not inherit</b> from <b>him, </b> and this is not the case. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit” | Bava Batra123a:3 | As the logical inference can lead to either conclusion, the <i>halakha</i> is determined by a derivation from a verse. <b>The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16). As the next verse spells out: “But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the former verse is ostensibly redundant. The additional verse is therefore understood as an inclusion: <b>The Torah increased inheritance with regard to</b> the <b>brothers, </b> indicating that the more brothers there are, the greater the portion they collect from the entire estate. <b>Therefore, you should not reason in accordance with the final formulation, </b> in which the <i>baraita</i> suggests that the firstborn inherits twice as much as all the other brothers combined, <b>but in accordance with the first formulation, </b> according to which the firstborn inherits twice as much as each other brother. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit” | Bava Batra130a:9 | <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yoḥanan ben Beroka? The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16), which is interpreted to mean that <b>the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath</b> his estate <b>to whomever he wishes</b> among his sons. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | the firstborn” | Bava Batra130b:1 | <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16)? |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | a person on his deathbed, since he is capable of bequeathal, | Bava Batra131a:2 | § <b>Rava raises a dilemma: In</b> the case of <b>a healthy person</b> who bequeaths his estate to one of his sons, <b>how</b> should the court rule? Should it be reasoned that <b>when R' Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that the bequeathal is valid, he said so specifically <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a person on his deathbed, since he is capable of bequeathal, </b> as the verse: “In the day that he causes his sons to inherit” (Deuteronomy 21:16), from which the validity of this bequeathal is derived, is referring specifically to the time of one’s death; <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person, </b> he did <b>not</b> say his ruling? <b>Or perhaps</b> he stated his ruling <b>even in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | an inheritance, | Bekhorot 52b:9 | As for <b>a firstborn, the verse states: “By giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and the Rabbis disagree with R' Meir, who derives from this verse that the portion of the firstborn has the status of a gift. Rather, they maintain that the verse <b>juxtaposes the</b> extra <b>portion of the firstborn to the portion</b> he receives as <b>an ordinary</b> brother: <b>Just as the portion</b> of <b>an ordinary</b> brother is not redistributed among the brothers in the Jubilee Year, but rather is <b>an inheritance, </b> as it is stated: “On the day that he causes his sons to inherit” (Deuteronomy 21:16), <b>so too the portion of the firstborn</b> is <b>an inheritance, </b> and is not returned in the Jubilee Year. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | “Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit | Sanhedrin 34b:17 | <b>And what</b> does <b>R' Meir interpret</b> from <b>this</b> verse: <b>“On the day that he causes his sons to inherit”? </b> He already derived from the juxtaposition to leprous sores that the court cannot issue a verdict at night. The Talmud answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rabba bar Ḥanina taught in the presence of Rav Naḥman: </b> The verse states: <b>“Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit</b> that which he has” (Deuteronomy 21:16). The addition of the term “on the day” teaches that it is specifically <b>during the day that you</b> can <b>distribute inheritances, but you cannot distribute inheritances at night. </b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: </b> That cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as, <b>if that is so, </b> then it ought to be that it is only in the case of <b>one who dies during the day</b> that <b>his children inherit</b> from <b>him but</b> that with regard to <b>one who dies at night, his children do not inherit</b> from <b>him, </b> and this is not the case. |
| Deuteronomy 21:16 | “Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit | Sanhedrin 34b:9 | The Talmud challenges this explanation: <b>If that is so</b> that this is the source of the <i>halakha</i>, the court should be able to conduct <b>the initial</b> stage <b>of the trial</b> at night, <b>as well. </b> The Talmud explains: It is possible to resolve the matter <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: It <b>is written</b> in one verse: <b>“And let them judge the people at all times, ”</b> indicating that the judgment can be during the day or at night, <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit</b> that which he has” (Deuteronomy 21:16), indicating that cases of inheritance are judged only during the day. Rava explains: <b>How</b> can these texts be reconciled? The verse referring to the <b>day</b> is stated <b>with regard to the initial</b> stage <b>of the trial, </b> and the verse that includes the <b>night</b> is stated <b>with regard to the verdict. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | of all that he has” | Bava Batra111b:1 | <b>He said to his attendant: Take</b> me away from here, as <b>this</b> man, R' Yehuda Nesia, <b>does not desire to learn</b> but is instead raising difficulties that are easily resolved. <b>And what is the reason</b> he does not receive a double portion? <b>Abaye said: The verse</b> concerning the double portion received by a firstborn son <b>states: </b> “By giving him a double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that he receives a double portion in all that <b>he</b> has, <b>but not</b> in all that <b>she</b> has. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | the first fruits of his strength [ ono ]” | Bava Batra111b:3 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> There is a different derivation teaching that <i>halakha</i>, as the same <b>verse states: </b> “For he is <b>the first fruits of his strength [<i>ono</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of the double portion is stated with regard to <b>his strength, but not her strength, </b> thereby excluding a son who is the firstborn of his mother alone. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | verse states: “The right of the firstborn is his” | Bava Batra111b:7 | <b>Rather, Rava said: </b> There is a different derivation teaching that <i>halakha</i>, as the same <b>verse states: “The right of the firstborn is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17). The emphasis on “his” indicates that <b>the primogeniture</b> applies specifically <b>to a man, and the primogeniture does not</b> apply <b>to a woman, </b> whether the woman is the one inheriting or is the legator. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” | Bava Batra122b:15 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), this means the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any other <b>one</b> inheritor. The <i>baraita</i> analyzes this statement: <b>Do you say</b> the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any <b>one</b> inheritor, <b>or rather, is it a double</b> portion <b>of all the property, </b> such that the firstborn receives two-thirds of the entire estate, which is twice the portion left for the other inheritors to divide between themselves? The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>And this</b> question can be resolved through <b>logical inference: </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | generations: | Bava Batra123a:5 | The <i>baraita</i> derives: <b>Birthright, </b> i.e., firstborn status, <b>is stated</b> here <b>with regard to Joseph, and birthright is stated</b> in another verse concerning the double portion <b>with regard to</b> the later <b>generations: </b> “By giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the birthright [<i>habekhora</i>] is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17). <b>Just as the birthright stated with regard to Joseph</b> is <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor, as the Talmud will explain, <b>so too the birthright stated with regard to</b> the later <b>generations</b> is <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | The verse states: “Giving him a double portion” | Bava Batra124a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the firstborn does not receive a double portion of any enhancements that occur after the death of the father? <b>The verse states: “Giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); by employing the term “giving” <b>God calls</b> the double portion <b>a gift. Just as</b> a recipient of a gift does not acquire <b>a gift unless it</b> first <b>reaches the possession of</b> the one giving the gift, <b>so too</b> the firstborn does not acquire <b>the portion of the firstborn unless it has reached the possession of</b> the father before he died. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | the verse states: “A double portion” | Bava Batra124a:5 | <b>And R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the reason for his ruling that a firstborn receives a double portion of the enhancement is that <b>the verse states: “A double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17). It <b>juxtaposes the portion of the firstborn to the portion of an ordinary</b> son, in that <b>just as the portion of an ordinary</b> son is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died, <b>so too, the portion of the firstborn</b> is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | of all that he has” | Bava Batra124b:5 | The Talmud comments that there are conflicting opinions in halakhic midrash as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of R' Yehuda HaNasi or in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as each opinion is supported by a different version of the midrash. <b>Rav Naḥman taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>from the other books of the school of Rav [<i>debei Rav</i>], </b> i.e., a volume of halakhic midrash other than <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, which is a halakhic midrash on the book of Leviticus. The phrase from the verse: “By giving him a double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>excludes the enhancement that the heirs brought about after their father’s death, </b> of which the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion. The Talmud infers: <b>But</b> of <b>the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death, he does take</b> a double portion. The Talmud comments: <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “He shall acknowledge | Bava Batra127b:4 | The Talmud explains: <b>What is</b> the dispute between R' Yehuda and the Rabbis? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: <b>“He shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the rabbis said: <b>He shall acknowledge him to others. </b> In other words, a father is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | he shall acknowledge | Bava Batra142b:5 | The Talmud notes: <b>In Sura they taught</b> Mar’s statement <b>that</b> way, but <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it <b>this</b> way: <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: A firstborn who was born after his father’s death does not receive a double</b> portion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>God states</b> in the Torah: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>and</b> in this case the father <b>is not</b> there <b>that</b> he can <b>acknowledge</b> him. The Talmud concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with all these versions</b> of that <b>which Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava. </b> Accordingly, a one-day-old child reduces the portion of the firstborn, a son born after his father’s death does not reduce the firstborn’s portion, and a firstborn born after his father’s death does not receive a double portion. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “He shall recognize” | Bekhorot 46b:11 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection to</b> the opinion of R' Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“He shall recognize”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the recognition of the face. And what</b> exactly <b>is the recognition of the face? </b> It is recognizing <b>the countenance of the face with the nose. </b> This indicates that the forehead alone is insufficient. The Talmud answers: <b>Teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as saying: <b>Up to, </b> but not including, <b>the nose. </b> The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 120a): <b>One can testify</b> that a man died, in order to permit his wife to remarry, <b>only</b> if he can attest <b>to</b> seeing <b>the countenance of the face with the nose, </b> as this allows one to identify the individual definitively. Once again, the Talmud answers that one should <b>teach: Up to, </b> but not including, <b>the nose. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | he shall recognize | Bekhorot 46b:9 | § Concerning this matter, <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: </b> The emergence of <b>a forehead</b> alone in the case of a person <b>exempts, </b> i.e., is considered a birth, <b>in all cases, except with regard to inheritance. </b> If a son reached out his head alone and then brought it back, after which his twin brother was born, the second brother is the firstborn with regard to inheritance. <b>What is the reason? God states: </b> “For <b>he shall recognize</b> the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” (Deuteronomy 21:17), and recognition is not attained by emergence of the forehead alone. <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Even with regard to inheritance</b> the emergence of a forehead is sufficient. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | had “the first of his strength” | Bekhorot 47a:2 | § <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the case of a man who <b>had children when he</b> was <b>a non-Jew and he</b> subsequently <b>converted: R' Yoḥanan says he does not have a firstborn with regard to inheritance, </b> i.e., a son who is his firstborn after his conversion does not inherit a double portion; <b>and R' Shimon ben Lakish says: He does have a firstborn with regard to inheritance. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>R' Yoḥanan says: He does not have a firstborn with regard to inheritance, as</b> this man already <b>had “the first of his strength”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Torah’s description of the firstborn in this context, before he converted. <b>And R' Shimon ben Lakish says: He does have a firstborn with regard to inheritance, </b> as the halakhic status of <b>a convert who</b> just <b>converted</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a child</b> just <b>born. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | the first of his strength, | Bekhorot 47b:14 | Similarly, the <b>second</b> son who follows him is <b>not</b> considered the firstborn <b>with regard to inheritance, </b> as <b>we require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “For he is <b>the first of his strength, </b> the right of the firstborn is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17), and this son is not the first. In addition, he is <b>also not</b> considered the firstborn <b>with regard to</b> the redemption of <b>five <i>sela</i></b> coins, as the <i>tanna</i> of the Mishnah <b>holds: A firstborn for</b> only <b>one matter, </b> i.e., he opened his mother’s womb but is not her first child, <b>is not considered a firstborn</b> with regard to redemption. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | the verse states: “The law of primogeniture is his” | Bekhorot 52a:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the firstborn son does not receive a double portion when inheriting the property of his mother. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason? </b> The Talmud explains that <b>the verse states: “The law of primogeniture is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); this is understood to mean that there is <b>a law of primogeniture for a man, </b> i.e., a duty to bequeath a double portion to his firstborn son, <b>and there is no law of primogeniture for a woman. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | of all that he has” | Bekhorot 52a:3 | The Mishnah teaches further: <b>And neither does he take</b> twice the portion <b>in</b> any <b>enhancement</b> of the value of the property after the death of his father. The Talmud explains that this is <b>because it is written: </b> “A double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and this enhancement was not in his father’s possession at the time of his death. The Mishnah also teaches: <b>Nor</b> does he take twice the portion in property <b>due</b> the father, <b>as</b> he does in the property <b>in possession</b> of the father. The Talmud explains that this too is <b>because it is written: “Of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and property due the father is not in his possession. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “By giving him a double portion” | Bekhorot 52b:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of R' Meir, </b> who holds that none of these items return in the Jubilee Year? The Talmud answers: <b>It is</b> with regard to land acquired specifically by means of <b>a sale that God states</b> that it <b>should be returned during the Jubilee</b> Year (see Leviticus 25:28), whereas <b>a gift and an inheritance</b> are <b>not</b> returned. <b>And these</b> cases listed in the Mishnah that are derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an inheritance</b> have the status of <b>an inheritance, and those</b> that are derived <b>from a gift</b> have the status of <b>a gift. </b> The Talmud elaborates: With regard to <b>a firstborn, </b> it is stated: <b>“By giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); here <b>God calls</b> the portion of a firstborn <b>a gift, </b> an item that is given. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | a firstborn, the verse states: “By giving him a double portion” | Bekhorot 52b:9 | As for <b>a firstborn, the verse states: “By giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and the Rabbis disagree with R' Meir, who derives from this verse that the portion of the firstborn has the status of a gift. Rather, they maintain that the verse <b>juxtaposes the</b> extra <b>portion of the firstborn to the portion</b> he receives as <b>an ordinary</b> brother: <b>Just as the portion</b> of <b>an ordinary</b> brother is not redistributed among the brothers in the Jubilee Year, but rather is <b>an inheritance, </b> as it is stated: “On the day that he causes his sons to inherit” (Deuteronomy 21:16), <b>so too the portion of the firstborn</b> is <b>an inheritance, </b> and is not returned in the Jubilee Year. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “The first fruit of his strength” | Kiddushin 29b:7 | The Talmud answers that this ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“firstborn”</b> stated here and <b>“firstborn” from</b> the verses dealing with <b>inheritance: Just as there, </b> the verse describes a firstborn who receives a double portion of the inheritance as: <b>“The first fruit of his strength”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), i.e., he is the firstborn son to his father, and not the first child born to his mother; <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn son, it is referring to the <b>first fruit of his strength, </b> which would mean that the father need redeem only his oldest child. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, every firstborn son to his mother must be redeemed. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | he shall acknowledge | Kiddushin 74a:4 | The Talmud continues to discuss the credibility of various people with regard to a firstborn. <b>Rav Naḥman says: Three are deemed credible with regard to</b> stating that a child is <b>a firstborn, </b> and <b>they are: A midwife, his father, and his mother. A midwife</b> is deemed credible only <b>immediately; his mother</b> is deemed credible <b>all</b> of the first <b>seven</b> days after his birth; <b>his father</b> is deemed credible <b>forever. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the rabbis said: The father <b>shall acknowledge him to others. </b> In other words, he is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “By giving him a double portion” | Kiddushin 78b:11 | The Talmud answers: It is necessary for a case <b>when he requires identification, </b> if the identity of the firstborn is unknown. In such a situation the verse teaches that the father is deemed credible. The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this relevant? Does it refer to the requirement: <b>“By giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), i.e., that the firstborn receives a double share of the inheritance? <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that he is deemed credible with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? His claim is supported by the fact that <b>he could have made a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>]: If he desired to give him</b> a double portion as <b>a gift</b> while he was alive, <b>would</b> the court <b>not give it to him? </b> Since the father could have given a double portion to the firstborn without having to testify that he is his firstborn, it cannot be that the verse is teaching us that he is deemed credible with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn receives a double portion of inheritance. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “He shall acknowledge | Kiddushin 78b:9 | The Mishnah teaches that <b>R' Yehuda says: They are deemed credible. </b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: <b>“He shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the rabbis said: <b>He, </b> the father, <b>shall acknowledge him to others. </b> In other words, he is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn. <b>From here, R' Yehuda said</b> that <b>a person is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son. And just as a person is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son, so too, a person is deemed credible to say</b> about his son: <b>This is a son of a divorced woman, or: This is a son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. And the Rabbis say: </b> As far as these latter claims are concerned, <b>he is not deemed credible. </b> He is deemed credible only to state which son is his firstborn. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | the first fruits of his strength [ ono ]; | Niddah 23b:3 | <b>Rava said, </b> in rejection of this proof: <b>Actually, </b> it is possible <b>that</b> a fetus shaped like an animal <b>can survive; but it is different there, </b> with regard to inheritance. The son that follows such a fetus has the status of a firstborn, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the inheritance of a firstborn: “By giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is <b>the first fruits of his strength [<i>ono</i>]; </b> the right of the firstborn is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17). It is derived from the verse that the status of a firstborn applies only to a son <b>over whose</b> death a father would <b>mourn. </b> The word <i>ono</i> is interpreted homiletically based on its similarity to the word <i>onen</i>, acute mourner. <b>This</b> offspring that has the form of an animal is therefore <b>excluded, as</b> its father <b>would not mourn over its</b> death. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | he shall acknowledge | Niddah 44b:4 | The Talmud notes: <b>In Sura they taught</b> Mar’s statement <b>that</b> way, whereas <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it <b>this</b> way: <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, said in the name of Rava: A firstborn who was born after his father’s death does not receive a double</b> portion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn…by giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>and</b> in this case the father <b>is not</b> there to acknowledge him. |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | “He shall acknowledge [ yakir ] | Yevamot 47a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>But did R' Yehuda</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> his <b>children he is not deemed credible? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall acknowledge [<i>yakir</i>]</b> the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” (Deuteronomy 21:17). The phrase “he shall acknowledge” is apparently superfluous. It is therefore expounded to teach that the father is deemed credible so that <b>he can identify him [<i>yakirenu</i>] to others. From here R' Yehuda said: A man is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son, and just as he is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son, so</b> too, a priest <b>is deemed credible to say: This son of mine is a son of a divorced woman</b> and myself, <b>or</b> to say: He is <b>a son of a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> and myself, and therefore he is disqualified due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalal</i>]. <b>And the Rabbis say: He is not deemed credible. </b> If R' Yehuda holds that a father is deemed credible to render his children unfit, why did he rule otherwise in the case of the convert? |
| Deuteronomy 21:17 | had “the first of his strength” | Yevamot 62a:10 | The Talmud comments: <b>And they follow their</b> regular line of reasoning, <b>as it was stated: </b> If <b>one had children</b> when <b>he</b> was <b>a non-Jew and he</b> subsequently <b>converted, R' Yoḥanan said: He does not have a firstborn with regard to inheritance, </b> i.e., the first son born to him after his conversion does not inherit a double portion, <b>as</b> this man already <b>had “the first of his strength”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Torah’s description of the firstborn in this context, before he converted. <b>And Reish Lakish said: He does have a firstborn with regard to inheritance, </b> as the legal status of <b>a convert who</b> just <b>converted is like</b> that of <b>a child</b> just <b>born. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | is also not judged as a stubborn and rebellious son, as the verse states: “If there will be [ yihyeh ] to a man a stubborn and rebellious son” | Bava Batra126b:14 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: </b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>is also not judged as a stubborn and rebellious son, as the verse states: “If there will be [<i>yihyeh</i>] to a man a stubborn and rebellious son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18), which is interpreted to mean that one is not judged in this manner <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | chastise | Ketubot 46a:5 | <b>R' Abbahu said: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>chastise</b> in the case of a defamer by verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>chastise</b> stated in the verse “if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son [<i>ben</i>], that will not listen to the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chastise him, will not listen to them” (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>chastise</b> in that verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>son</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>son [<i>ben</i>]</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the word <b><i>bin</i></b> in the verse <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserve [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son” | Sanhedrin 107a:14 | Hushai <b>said</b> to him: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you married a beautiful woman, </b> the mother of Absalom? David <b>said to him: </b> With regard to <b>a beautiful woman, God permitted</b> marrying <b>her. </b> Hushai <b>said to him: </b> But <b>you did not interpret the juxtaposed</b> verses, <b>as juxtaposed to</b> the portion of the beautiful woman is the portion beginning: <b>“If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18). From that juxtaposition it is derived: <b>Anyone who marries a beautiful woman has a stubborn and rebellious son. </b> Therefore, even if Absalom kills you, there will be no desecration of God’s name, as the people will attribute his actions to his mother. |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | son” | Sanhedrin 68b:2 | <b>From when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs, </b> which are a sign of puberty and from which time he is considered an adult, <b>until he has grown a beard around. </b> The reference here is to <b>the lower</b> beard surrounding his genitals, <b>and not the upper</b> beard, i.e., his facial hair, <b>but the rabbis spoke in euphemistic terms. As it is stated: “If a man has</b> a stubborn and rebellious <b>son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18), which indicates that the penalty for rebelliousness is imposed upon <b>a son, but not</b> upon <b>a daughter; </b> and upon <b>a son, but not</b> upon a fully grown <b>man. A minor</b> under the age of thirteen is <b>exempt</b> from the penalty imposed upon a stubborn and rebellious son, <b>because he has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the age of <b>inclusion in mitzvot. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | as the verse states: “If a man has a son” | Sanhedrin 68b:5 | <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> A minor is exempt from the punishment imposed upon a stubborn and rebellious son, <b>as the verse states: “If a man has a son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a son who is close to</b> the stage of having <b>the strength of a man, </b> i.e., close to full maturity, but not to a younger boy. |
| Deuteronomy 21:18 | “chastise” | Sanhedrin 71b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>Where is it written</b> that <b>lashes</b> are administered <b>to a stubborn and rebellious son? </b> There is no explicit mention of lashes in the verse. The Talmud answers: It is <b>as R' Abbahu</b> said in another context, <b>as R' Abbahu says: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> as stated with regard to a defamer: “And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him” (Deuteronomy 22:18), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“chastise”</b> stated with regard to a rebellious son (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> in the latter verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“son”</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“son [<i>ben</i>]”</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the similar word <b>“<i>bin</i>”</b> stated with regard to lashes: <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserves [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). Consequently, the chastisement mentioned with regard to both a defamer and a rebellious son involves flogging. |
| Deuteronomy 21:19 | the elders of his city | Makkot 10b:18 | <b>And a city in which there are no elders</b> is the subject of another dispute between <b>R' Ami and R' Asi. One says: </b> One <b>can become a wayward and rebellious son in it. And one says: </b> One <b>cannot become a wayward and rebellious son in it. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>According to the one who says</b> that one <b>cannot become wayward and rebellious son in it, </b> it is due to the fact that <b>we require</b> the presence of the elders of the city, as it is written: “And his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to <b>the elders of his city</b> and the gate of his place” (Deuteronomy 21:19), <b>and there are none. According to the one who says</b> that one <b>can become a wayward and rebellious son in it, </b> the presence of the elders is <b>merely a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 21:19 | as it is stated: | Sanhedrin 45b:15 | This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>as it is stated: </b> “Then shall his father and his mother lay hold of him, and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place” (Deuteronomy 21:19). This serves to teach: His father and mother <b>“lay hold of him, ” but not</b> those <b>without a hand</b> who cannot grab him; <b>“and bring him out, ” but not</b> those who are <b>lame</b> and cannot take him out. And it is stated: “And they shall say to the elders of his city: This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard” (Deuteronomy 21:20). This verse serves to teach: <b>“And they shall say, ” but not mute people; “this our son, ” but not the blind, </b> who cannot point to the boy; <b>“he does not obey our voice, ” but not the deaf. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:20 | “This son of ours | Pesachim 116b:8 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: A blind</b> person <b>is exempt from reciting</b> the <b>Haggadah. </b> The proof is that <b>it is written here, </b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And you shall tell your son on that day saying, <b>it is because of this</b> which YHWH did for me when I came forth out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:8), <b>and it was written there, </b> with regard to the stubborn and rebellious son, that his parents say: <b>“This son of ours</b> is stubborn and rebellious, he does not listen to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard” (Deuteronomy 21:20). The Talmud explains the verbal analogy of the word “this”: <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of the rebellious son, the rabbis expound that the verse <b>excludes a blind</b> person, as a blind parent cannot say: This son of ours, for he cannot point to him; <b>so too here, </b> in the case of the recitation of the Passover Haggadah, the word “this” <b>excludes blind</b> people. |
| Deuteronomy 21:20 | lame | Sanhedrin 45b:15 | This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>as it is stated: </b> “Then shall his father and his mother lay hold of him, and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place” (Deuteronomy 21:19). This serves to teach: His father and mother <b>“lay hold of him, ” but not</b> those <b>without a hand</b> who cannot grab him; <b>“and bring him out, ” but not</b> those who are <b>lame</b> and cannot take him out. And it is stated: “And they shall say to the elders of his city: This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard” (Deuteronomy 21:20). This verse serves to teach: <b>“And they shall say, ” but not mute people; “this our son, ” but not the blind, </b> who cannot point to the boy; <b>“he does not obey our voice, ” but not the deaf. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:20 | is a glutton [ zolel ] and a drunkard [ vesovei ]” | Sanhedrin 70a:4 | The Mishnah summarizes: If <b>he ate an item that</b> involves performing <b>a mitzva or an item that</b> involves committing <b>a transgression, </b> or if <b>he ate any food</b> in the world <b>but did not eat meat, </b> or if he <b>drank any beverage but did not drink wine, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son, unless he</b> actually <b>eats meat and</b> actually <b>drinks wine, as it is stated: </b> “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not listen to our voice; he…<b>is a glutton [<i>zolel</i>] and a drunkard [<i>vesovei</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:20). One is not called a glutton and a drunkard unless he eats meat and drinks wine. <b>And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof to the matter</b> that the reference in the Torah is to meat and wine, <b>there is an allusion to the matter</b> in another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers [<i>besovei</i>], among gluttonous eaters [<i>bezolelei</i>] of meat”</b> (Proverbs 23:20). |
| Deuteronomy 21:20 | he will not obey our voices” | Sanhedrin 70b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what</b> is <b>the reason</b> that eating an item involving a mitzva or a transgression does not render him a stubborn and rebellious son? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: </b> “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; <b>he will not obey our voices”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:20), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies to a boy who does not obey <b>“our voices, ”</b> i.e., the voice of his parents, <b>but not</b> to one who also does not obey <b>the voice of God. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:20 | kolenu | Sanhedrin 71a:13 | <b>Rather, </b> R' Yehuda <b>is saying</b> that the boy’s mother must be <b>identical to his father</b> in several aspects. The Talmud comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says: If his mother was not identical to his father in voice, appearance, and height, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As the verse states: “He will not obey our voices</b> [<b><i>kolenu</i></b>]” (Deuteronomy 21:20), which indicates that they both have the same voice. And <b>since we require</b> that they be <b>identical</b> in <b>voice, we also require</b> that they be <b>identical</b> in <b>appearance and height. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | if there is in a man a sin deserving of death and he is put to death” | Sanhedrin 35b:9 | Rava continues: <b>One student said in the name of R' Yishmael</b> that <b>since it is stated: </b> “And <b>if there is in a man a sin deserving of death and he is put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the court administers capital punishment <b>both during the week and on Shabbat. And</b> accordingly, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of what the verse states concerning Shabbat: <b>“Everyone that desecrates it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? One possibility is that the term: Desecration of Shabbat, applies only <b>to other</b> cases in which <b>labor</b> is performed, and <b>excludes</b> instances of <b>the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court, </b> which is not a desecration of Shabbat. <b>Or rather, </b> derive that <b>even the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court</b> is prohibited as desecration of Shabbat. <b>And how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is put to death”? </b> One possibility is that the mitzva of executing transgressors applies <b>on weekdays, but not on Shabbat. Or rather, </b> the other possibility is that it applies <b>even on Shabbat. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | and he is put to death, and you shall hang | Sanhedrin 45b:22 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the corpses of all those who are killed by stoning are hung after their death. <b>A baraita states</b> in a related <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, <b>and he is put to death, and you shall hang</b> him on a tree” (Deuteronomy 21:22): One <b>might</b> have thought that the corpses of <b>all those who are put to death are hung. </b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: </b> “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree…<b>for he that is hung is a curse of God”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:23), teaching that <b>just as the blasphemer, </b> who <b>is</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished by <b>stoning, </b> is hung after his death, <b>so too, all those</b> who are liable <b>to</b> be punished by <b>stoning</b> are later hung, but those who are liable to be executed in other ways are not hung after their death. This is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | and you shall hang him | Sanhedrin 46a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches that according to the opinion of R' Eliezer, the corpse of <b>a man is hung</b> facing the people while the corpse of a woman is hung facing the tree, whereas the Rabbis say that the corpse of a woman is not hung at all. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> behind the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? </b> The Talmud answers: As <b>the verse states: </b> “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, <b>and you shall hang him</b> on a tree” (Deuteronomy 21:22), which teaches that you shall hang <b>him</b> on a tree after his death, <b>but</b> you shall <b>not</b> hang <b>her</b> on a tree after her death. <b>And R' Eliezer</b> would respond that the inference to be drawn from this verse is that after his death they hang <b>him</b> by himself, <b>without his clothing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | and he is put to death, and you shall hang | Sanhedrin 46b:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Were it stated: </b> And if a man has committed <b>a sin</b> worthy of death <b>you shall hang</b> him on a tree, <b>I would have said</b> that first <b>they hang him and</b> only <b>afterward they put him to death, the way the</b> non-Jew <b>government does, </b> executing the transgressor by hanging. Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, <b>and he is put to death, and you shall hang</b> him on a tree” (Deuteronomy 21:22), teaching that first <b>they put him to death, and</b> only <b>afterward they hang him. How so? They delay</b> the verdict <b>until</b> it is <b>near</b> to <b>sunset, and</b> then <b>they conclude his judgment, and they put him to death, and</b> immediately <b>afterward hang him. One ties</b> him to the hanging post, <b>and another</b> immediately <b>unties</b> him, <b>in order to fulfill the mitzva of hanging</b> the corpse of the executed transgressor. |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | and you shall hang him on a tree” | Sotah 23b:11 | The Mishnah states: <b>A man is hanged, but</b> a woman is <b>not</b> hanged. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: </b> “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, <b>and you shall hang him on a tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22). The verse indicates that one should hang <b>“him, ”</b> a man, <b>but not her, </b> a woman. |
| Deuteronomy 21:22 | since it is stated: “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death” | Yevamot 6b:9 | <b>A student said in the name of R' Yishmael</b> that <b>since it is stated: “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the death penalty is administered <b>whether on a weekday</b> or <b>on a Shabbat. And how do I establish</b> the verse: “And you shall keep Shabbat, for it is sacred to you; <b>every one who profanes it shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? This verse applies <b>to other</b> prohibited <b>labors, except for court-imposed capital punishment, </b> which must be administered even on Shabbat. <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> the case that <b>even court-imposed capital punishment</b> is included in the list of prohibited labors on Shabbat. <b>How, </b> then, <b>do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“And he is put to death”? </b> This is referring <b>to a weekday and not to Shabbat. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | for he that is hung is a curse of God” | Sanhedrin 45b:22 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the corpses of all those who are killed by stoning are hung after their death. <b>A baraita states</b> in a related <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, <b>and he is put to death, and you shall hang</b> him on a tree” (Deuteronomy 21:22): One <b>might</b> have thought that the corpses of <b>all those who are put to death are hung. </b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: </b> “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree…<b>for he that is hung is a curse of God”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:23), teaching that <b>just as the blasphemer, </b> who <b>is</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished by <b>stoning, </b> is hung after his death, <b>so too, all those</b> who are liable <b>to</b> be punished by <b>stoning</b> are later hung, but those who are liable to be executed in other ways are not hung after their death. This is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | for he that is hung is a curse of God” | Sanhedrin 46a:14 | The dead man hangs there for only a very short time, <b>and</b> then <b>they immediately untie him. And if he was left</b> hanging <b>overnight, a prohibition is transgressed, as it is stated: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him</b> that day, <b>for he that is hung is a curse of God”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:23). <b>That is to say: </b> Were the corpse left hanging on the tree overnight, people would ask: <b>For what</b> reason <b>was this one hung</b> after he was put to death? They would be answered: <b>Because he blessed God, </b> a euphemism for blasphemy. <b>And therefore the name of Heaven would be desecrated</b> were the dead man’s corpse to remain hanging, reminding everybody of his transgression. |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | “But you shall bury | Sanhedrin 46b:10 | The Talmud relates: <b>King Shapur, </b> the monarch of Persia, once <b>said to Rav Ḥama: From where in the Torah is there a hint to</b> the mitzva of <b>burial? </b> What proof is there that the dead must be buried and not treated in some other manner? Rav Ḥama <b>was silent and said nothing to him, </b> as he could not find a suitable source. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: The world has been handed over to the foolish, as</b> Rav Ḥama <b>should have said</b> to King Shapur that the mitzva of burial is derived from the verse: <b>“But you shall bury</b> him” (Deuteronomy 21:23). |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | kavor | Sanhedrin 46b:3 | <b>A baraita states: </b> From the verse: “And you shall hang him on <b>a tree, ” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the body may be hung <b>either</b> on a tree that has been <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>or</b> on one that is still <b>attached</b> to the ground. Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, <b>but you shall bury</b> him [<b><i>kavor</i></b> <i>tikberennu</i>] that day” (Deuteronomy 21:23). Based on the doubled verb, it is derived that not only must the transgressor’s body be buried, but the tree on which it is hung must also be buried. As the verse employs the same term to instruct that both must be buried, the verse teaches that the corpse must be hung on a tree <b>that</b> has already been detached from the ground and <b>is lacking only burial, </b> just as the corpse is lacking only burial. This serves to <b>exclude</b> hanging the corpse on a tree <b>that</b> is still attached to the ground and <b>is lacking</b> both <b>cutting down and burial. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | transgresses a prohibition? The verse states: “But you shall bury him [ kavor tikberennu ]” | Sanhedrin 46b:8 | § The Mishnah teaches that everyone, <b>not only</b> an executed transgressor, must be buried on the day of his death, if that is at all possible. <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon bar Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who leaves his deceased</b> relative <b>overnight</b> without burying him <b>transgresses a prohibition? The verse states: “But you shall bury him [<i>kavor tikberennu</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:23), doubling the verb for emphasis. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that one who leaves his deceased</b> relative <b>overnight</b> without burying him <b>transgresses a prohibition. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | when the Merciful One states: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, | Sanhedrin 47a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> can it be that <b>due to the honor of the living, they allow the deceased to remain</b> unburied <b>overnight? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, </b> as <b>when God states: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, </b> but you shall bury him that day” (Deuteronomy 21:23), it teaches that the prohibition applies only to cases <b>similar to</b> that <b>of</b> a person whose body is <b>hung</b> after his death, <b>who suffers degradation</b> when his corpse is left hanging overnight. <b>But here, since</b> the deceased <b>does not suffer degradation</b> when the funeral is delayed, as the delay is in order that the burial will be performed with greater dignity, there is <b>no</b> violation of the prohibition, and he may be left unburied overnight. |
| Deuteronomy 21:23 | Isn’t it written: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree; | Yevamot 79a:8 | The Talmud continues with its analysis of the incident. The verse states: <b>“And Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she allowed neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night”</b> (II Samuel 21:10). The Talmud raises a difficulty: How could they have left Saul’s executed sons unburied all that time? <b>Isn’t it written: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree; </b> but you shall surely bury him the same day” (Deuteronomy 21:23)? |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | “sheep” | Bava Kamma54a:12 | <b>Rather, Rava said: </b> The term <b>“donkey”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda, and</b> the term <b>“sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1), stated <b>with regard to a lost</b> item, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>everyone</b> (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 27a) are <b>difficult. </b> There is no explanation for why they are stated. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | Rav Yosef: | Bava Kamma57a:9 | <b>Rabba raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef: </b> The verse states in the context of returning lost items: “Return them” (Deuteronomy 22:1), repeating the verb “<i>hashev teshivem</i>. ” The rabbis expounded as follows: From the word <b>“<i>hashev</i>” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one may return the item <b>to the house</b> of the owner of the lost article. <b>From where</b> do I derive that even if one returns it <b>to his garden or to his ruin, </b> i.e., an unused structure on his property, he has discharged his obligation and is no longer responsible for the item that he found? For this, <b>the verse states: “<i>Teshivem</i>, ”</b> repeating the verb for emphasis, to teach that he fulfills the mitzva by returning the item <b>to any place</b> belonging to the owner. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | “You shall return | Bava Metzia26b:5 | § <b>And Rava says: </b> In a case where <b>one saw a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that fell</b> from another, if <b>he took</b> the coin <b>in order to steal it, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>he violates all of</b> the following mitzvot: He is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not…rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13); <b>and due to</b> the positive mitzva, stated with regard to found items, of: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and due to</b> the prohibition, stated with regard to one who finds an item: <b>“You may not disregard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>And even if he returned it after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, it is merely <b>a gift that he gave him; and the transgression that he performed, he performed, </b> and he remains in violation of these mitzvot. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | and disregard | Bava Metzia30a:14 | § The Mishnah teaches: If a person <b>found a sack or a basket or any</b> other <b>item that</b> it <b>is not his</b> typical <b>manner to take</b> and carry because it is beneath his dignity, <b>he</b> shall <b>not take</b> it. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to the return of a lost item: “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering <b>and disregard</b> them; you shall return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). The <i>tanna</i> explains that the phrase “and disregard them” means that there are <b>occasions</b> in <b>which you may disregard</b> lost items <b>and</b> there are <b>occasions</b> in <b>which you may not disregard</b> them. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | is a positive mitzva: | Bava Metzia30a:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>For what</b> case <b>was a verse necessary</b> to derive that one may disregard a lost item? <b>If we say</b> that the verse is necessary <b>for</b> the case of <b>a priest and</b> the lost item <b>in the graveyard, </b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he need not return the item, as <b>this</b> obligation to return the lost item <b>is a positive mitzva: </b> “You shall return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and that</b> entry of a priest into a graveyard is prohibited by both <b>a prohibition: </b> “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), <b>and a positive mitzva: </b> “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 21:6); and there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva does not override a prohibition and a positive mitzva. And furthermore, we do not override</b> a ritual <b>prohibition in the face of monetary matters. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | you shall return them | Bava Metzia30b:15 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>Which is</b> the item that is considered <b>lost property? </b> If <b>one found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, that is not lost property, </b> as presumably the owners are nearby and are aware of the animals’ whereabouts. If one found <b>a donkey with its accoutrements overturned, or a cow</b> that <b>ran through the vineyards, that is lost property. </b> In a case where <b>one returned</b> the lost animal <b>and it fled, </b> and he again <b>returned it and it fled, even</b> if this scenario repeats itself <b>four or five times, </b> he is <b>obligated to return it</b> each time, as it <b>is stated: </b> “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering and disregard them; <b>you shall return them</b> to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | returned it and it fled, | Bava Metzia31a:12 | § The Mishnah teaches: In a case where <b>one returned</b> the lost animal <b>and it fled, </b> and he again <b>returned it and it fled, </b> even if this scenario repeats itself four or five times, he is obligated to return it each time, as it is stated: “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering and disregard them; you shall return them [<i>hashev teshivem</i>] to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). The Talmud understands that from the use of the compound form of the verb, “<i>hashev teshivem</i>,” the Mishnah derives that one must return the lost animal multiple times if it flees. The Talmud asks: <b>A certain</b> one <b>of the rabbis said to Rava: Say</b> that from <b>“<i>hashev</i>”</b> one derives the obligation to return the animal <b>once, </b> and from <b>“<i>teshivem</i>”</b> one derives the obligation to return the animal <b>twice, </b> and beyond that there is no obligation. |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | Come and hear: | Berakhot 19b:12 | The Talmud cites an additional proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Come and hear: </b> With regard to the laws of returning a lost object, it is stated: “You shall not see the ox of your brother or his sheep go astray and ignore them; return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). The <i>baraita</i> explains that the seemingly extraneous expression <b>and disregard them</b> must be understood to give license that <b>at times you disregard</b> lost objects <b>and at times you do not disregard them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | “You shall return | Chullin 87a:10 | § The Mishnah teaches that if one <b>covered</b> the blood <b>and it was</b> then <b>uncovered</b> he is not obligated to cover it again. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is different</b> about this case from the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item, where the Master said: </b> The verse states with regard to the obligation to return a lost item: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>even one hundred times? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:1 | He testifies? But isn’t it taught | Sanhedrin 18b:5 | § The Mishnah teaches that the High Priest <b>testifies</b> before the court <b>and</b> others <b>testify concerning him. </b> The Talmud expresses surprise: <b>He testifies? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the verse: “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering and ignore them; you shall return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), the use of the unusual term <b>“and ignore</b> them,” as opposed to the more direct: Do not ignore them, indicates that there are <b>times when you ignore</b> lost items <b>and</b> there are <b>times when you do not ignore</b> them. <b>How so? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | The verse states: “And you shall restore it | Bava Kamma81b:14 | The Talmud asks a further question: Why was it necessary for Joshua to stipulate that one may find his way out in this manner? After all, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by Torah law. </b> When one is lost, whoever can assist in helping him find his way must do so by Torah law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is a mitzva to return lost items to their owner. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the requirement applies even to <b>returning his body, </b> i.e., helping a lost person find his way? <b>The verse states: “And you shall restore it</b> to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be translated as: And you shall restore himself to him. If this is required by Torah law, why did Joshua stipulate a condition to this effect? |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | and it shall be with you until your brother claims [ derosh ] it, | Bava Metzia27b:4 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a Mishnah (28b): “And if your brother be not near you, and you know him not, then you shall bring it into your house, <b>and it shall be with you until your brother claims [<i>derosh</i>] it, </b> and you shall return it to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2). <b>Would it enter your mind that he would give</b> the lost item <b>to him before he claims it? </b> How can the finder return it if he does not know the identity of the owner? <b>Rather, </b> the verb <i>derosh</i> is not referring to the claim of the owner; it is referring to the scrutiny performed by the finder. <b>Scrutinize him [<i>darshehu</i>]</b> to determine <b>whether</b> the claimant <b>is a swindler</b> or <b>whether he is not a swindler. </b> Only then may you return the lost item to him. |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | and it shall be with you until your brother claims [ derosh ] it, | Bava Metzia28a:2 | <b>Rather, Rava said: </b> Identification of an item on the basis of <b>distinguishing marks</b> is <b>by Torah law, as it is written: </b> “And if your brother be not near you, and you know him not, then you shall bring it into your house, <b>and it shall be with you until your brother claims [<i>derosh</i>] it, </b> and you shall return it to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2). <b>Would it enter your mind that he would give</b> the lost item <b>to him before he claims it? </b> How can the finder return it if he does not know the identity of the owner? <b>Rather, </b> the verb <i>derosh</i> is not referring to the claim of the owner; it is referring to the scrutiny performed by the finder. <b>Scrutinize him [<i>darshehu</i>]</b> to determine <b>whether</b> the claimant <b>is a swindler</b> or <b>whether he is not a swindler. </b> Only then may you return the lost item to him. <b>What, is it not</b> that the one who claims the lost item proves that he is not a swindler <b>on the basis of distinguishing marks</b> that he provides? Rava affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that identification of an item on the basis of distinguishing marks is by Torah law. |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | and you shall return it to him” | Bava Metzia28b:13 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If one finds <b>any</b> living <b>being that works and</b> generates enough revenue to cover the costs of the food that it <b>eats, </b> it <b>shall work and eat</b> while in the finder’s possession. <b>And any</b> living <b>being that does not work but</b> it does <b>eat shall be sold, as it is stated: </b> “Then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you until your brother claims it, <b>and you shall return it to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), indicating that the finder must <b>see how</b> best <b>to return it to him. </b> Since the owner must repay the finder for his expenditures, if feeding the animal costs more than its value, the finder’s keeping the animal in his possession will prevent the owner from recovering it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | “And you shall return it to him” | Bava Metzia28b:21 | The Mishnah teaches: <b>And</b> any living being <b>that does not work but</b> it does <b>eat</b> shall be sold. <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall return it to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), indicating that the finder must <b>see how</b> best <b>to return it to him, </b> meaning <b>that</b> one <b>shall not feed</b> the value of <b>a calf to</b> the lost <b>calves</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a foal to</b> the lost <b>foals</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a goose to</b> the <b>geese</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a rooster to</b> the <b>roosters</b> that he is tending. Were the finder to do so, ultimately, the owner would receive nothing. |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | until your brother claims [ derosh ] it [ oto ], | Bava Metzia28b:5 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If a claimant accurately <b>stated</b> what type of item <b>the lost item</b> that was found by another is, <b>but did not state, </b> i.e., describe, <b>its distinguishing marks, </b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> it <b>to him. And</b> in the case of <b>a swindler, even though he stated its distinguishing marks, </b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> the lost item <b>to him, as it is stated: </b> “And if your brother be not near you, and you know him not, then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you <b>until your brother claims [<i>derosh</i>] it [<i>oto</i>], </b> and you shall return it to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2). Would it enter your mind that the finder would give it to him before he claims it? How can the finder return it if he does not know the identity of the owner? Rather, the verb <i>derosh</i> is not referring to the claim of the owner; it is referring to the scrutiny performed by the finder. You shall not return the lost item <b>until</b> you <b>scrutinize [<i>shetidrosh</i>] your brother</b> to determine <b>whether</b> he, the claimant, <b>is a swindler</b> or <b>whether he is not a swindler. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:2 | The verse states: “And you shall restore it [ vahashevato ] to him [ lo ]” | Sanhedrin 73a:7 | Concerning <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, </b> it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who sees another drowning in a river, or being dragged away by</b> a wild <b>animal, or being attacked by bandits, is obligated to save him? The verse states: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). The Talmud asks about this derivation: <b>But is this</b> really <b>derived from here? </b> It is <b>derived from there, </b> i.e., from a different verse, as it is taught: The Torah teaches that one must return lost property to its rightful owner. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that one must help his neighbor who may suffer <b>the loss of his body</b> or his health? <b>The verse states: “And you shall restore it [<i>vahashevato</i>] to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be read as: And you shall restore him [<i>vehashevato</i>] to him, i.e., saving his body. Consequently, there should be no need for the additional verse: “You shall not stand idly by the blood of another. ” |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | with every lost item of your brother” | Avodah Zarah26b:2 | R' Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> R' Abbahu: <b>I teach</b> that the verse: “And so you shall do <b>with every lost item of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), serves <b>to include the apostate</b> in one’s obligation to return a lost item to another Jew; <b>and you say</b> that <b>one may lower</b> him into a pit? <b>Remove</b> the term <b>apostate from here. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | “With every lost thing of your brother’s” | Bava Kamma113b:8 | It is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item, as Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>the lost item of a non-Jew? </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the mitzva of returning a lost item: <b>“With every lost thing of your brother’s”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), indicating that it is only <b>to your brother</b> that <b>you return</b> a lost item, <b>but you do not return</b> a lost item <b>to a non-Jew. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | and you have found” | Bava Kamma113b:9 | The Talmud questions this derivation: <b>But say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only <b>where</b> the item <b>has not yet come into</b> the Jew’s <b>hand, as he is not obligated to pursue it</b> in an effort to find the lost item and return it. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where the item had</b> already <b>come into his hand, say</b> that he must <b>return it</b> to the non-Jew. The Talmud answers that <b>Ravina said: </b> It is understood from the verse itself, as it states: “And so shall you do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, <b>and you have found”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), which <b>indicates</b> that the verse refers even to an item <b>that</b> has already <b>come into one’s hand. </b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: In a case where there is</b> a concern that retention of an article lost by a non-Jew will result in the <b>desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, </b> it is <b>prohibited even</b> to retain a non-Jew’s <b>lost item. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | “For every lost thing of your brother” | Bava Kamma54b:9 | <b>With regard to the double payment</b> of a thief, it is <b>as we say</b> in a halakhic exegesis of the verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), that it is a general statement which <b>includes any matter</b> of <b>negligence. With regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item, </b> the verse states comprehensively: <b>“For every lost thing of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>unloading</b> a burden, <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat, </b> as the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | as it is written: “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it” | Bava Metzia22b:5 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Yishmael ben Yehotzadak: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a lost item that the river swept away that it is permitted</b> for its finder to keep it? It is derived from this verse, <b>as it is written: “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). The verse states that one must return <b>that which is lost from him, </b> the owner, <b>but is</b> available to be <b>found by any person. Excluded</b> from that obligation is <b>that which is lost from him and is not</b> available to be <b>found by any person; </b> it is ownerless property and anyone who finds it may keep it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | “You may not disregard” | Bava Metzia26b:5 | § <b>And Rava says: </b> In a case where <b>one saw a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that fell</b> from another, if <b>he took</b> the coin <b>in order to steal it, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>he violates all of</b> the following mitzvot: He is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not…rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13); <b>and due to</b> the positive mitzva, stated with regard to found items, of: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and due to</b> the prohibition, stated with regard to one who finds an item: <b>“You may not disregard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>And even if he returned it after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, it is merely <b>a gift that he gave him; and the transgression that he performed, he performed, </b> and he remains in violation of these mitzvot. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | which shall be lost | Bava Metzia27a:11 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, <b>which shall be lost</b> from him, and you have found it” (Deuteronomy 22:3). The Rabbis derive that this phrase serves <b>to exclude a lost item in which there is not the value of one <i>peruta</i>, </b> which due to its negligible value is not considered lost. <b>R' Yehuda says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the conclusion of that verse: “Which shall be lost from him, <b>and you have found it. ”</b> The term “and you have found it” serves <b>to exclude a lost item in which there is not the value of one <i>peruta</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | of Rabbenai. As Rabbenai says | Bava Metzia27a:14 | The Talmud answers: According to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary for</b> the derivation of the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbenai. As Rabbenai says</b> in interpreting the verse: “And so shall you do with every lost item of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found it” (Deuteronomy 22:3), that the term <b>“and you have found it” means that</b> it assumes the status of a found item only <b>when</b> it actually <b>enters his possession. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it” | Bava Metzia27a:16 | The Talmud answers: According to R' Yehuda, <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary for</b> the derivation of the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yoḥanan. As R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a lost item that the river swept away that it is permitted</b> for its finder to keep it? It is derived from this verse, <b>as it is written: </b> “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and <b>so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). The verse states that one must return <b>that which is lost from him, </b> the owner, <b>but is</b> available to be <b>found by any person. Excluded</b> from that obligation is <b>that which is lost from him and is not</b> available to be <b>found by any person; </b> it is ownerless property and anyone who finds it may keep it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | every lost item of your brother, | Bava Metzia27a:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> When the Mishnah says that the garment was included <b>in the generalization</b> that one must return <b>all of these</b> items, in <b>what</b> generalization is it included? <b>Rava said: </b> It is included <b>in the generalization: </b> “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with <b>every lost item of your brother, </b> which shall be lost from him, and you have found it; you may not disregard it” (Deuteronomy 22:3). |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | saw it? But didn’t Rabbenai say | Bava Metzia2a:7 | The Talmud challenges this explanation: <b>But how can you say</b> that <b>what</b> the term: I <b>found it, </b> means is actually: I <b>saw it? But didn’t Rabbenai say</b> in interpreting the verse: “And so shall you do with every lost item of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found it” (Deuteronomy 22:3), that <b>“and you have found it” indicates that it came into his possession? </b> The term find in the Torah refers exclusively to a situation where the item is in the possession of the finder. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | with every lost item of your brother” | Bava Metzia31a:2 | <b>Rava says</b> that the verse: “And so shall you do <b>with every lost item of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), serves <b>to include</b> an obligation to protect your brother from the <b>loss of</b> his <b>land. Rav Ḥananya said to Rava: </b> There is a <i>baraita</i> <b>that is taught that supports your</b> opinion. If <b>one saw water that is flowing and coming</b> to inundate another’s field, <b>he must establish a barrier before</b> the water in order to preserve the field. |
| Deuteronomy 22:3 | There it is different, as it is written: “And disregard them,” | Berakhot 19b:14 | The Talmud answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “And disregard them, ”</b> indicating that under certain circumstances one is permitted to disregard a lost object. In that case, there is a biblical directive that creates an exception to the prohibition: “You may not disregard” (Deuteronomy 22:3). We found a case in which human dignity overrides a Torah prohibition. The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us derive</b> a general principle that human dignity takes precedence over all mitzvot in the Torah <b>from this</b> case. This possibility is rejected: <b>We do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>prohibitions</b> from <b>monetary</b> laws, and the case of the lost object merely entails a monetary loss, unlike other prohibitions. |
| Deuteronomy 22:4 | you shall lift them [ hakem takim ] with him” | Bava Metzia31a:20 | The verse states: “You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen by the wayside, and hide yourself from them; <b>you shall lift them [<i>hakem takim</i>] with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is obligated to help load the animal in a case where <b>its owner is with it. From where</b> is the obligation to load it in a case <b>where its owner is not with it</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Hakem takim</i>, ”</b> to teach that there is an obligation to load it <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:4 | loading as well, isn’t it written: “You shall lift them with him” | Bava Metzia32a:17 | § The Mishnah teaches: There is <b>a mitzva by Torah law to unload</b> a burden, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it? <b>If we say</b> that it means: <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it <b>at all; what is different</b> about <b>unloading, with regard to which it is written: “You shall release it with him”</b> (Exodus 23:5)? With regard to <b>loading as well, isn’t it written: “You shall lift them with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4)? |
| Deuteronomy 22:4 | there it is written: “Fallen down by the way” | Bava Metzia32a:21 | <b>And the Rabbis</b> could ask: <b>Why</b> does R' Shimon say that <b>the verses are not</b> clearly <b>defined? Here it is written: “Collapsed under its burden”</b> (Exodus 23:5), clearly referring to the case of a burden that needs unloading, and <b>there it is written: “Fallen down by the way”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4), <b>indicating</b> that both the animals <b>and their burdens are</b> lying <b>on the way</b> and are in need of loading. <b>And R' Shimon</b> explains that the verses are not defined because the phrase <b>“fallen down by the way”</b> could be understood as <b>indicating</b> that the animals are fallen <b>with their burdens upon them, </b> and referring to unloading. |
| Deuteronomy 22:4 | “You shall lift them with him” | Bava Metzia33a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And can you establish</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili? But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Under its burden, ” but not</b> when it is <b>unloaded? What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Not</b> when it is <b>unloaded? If we say</b> that it means that when it is <b>unloaded</b> there is <b>no</b> obligation <b>at all, isn’t it written</b> in that case: <b>“You shall lift them with him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:4), teaching that there is a mitzva to load an animal? <b>Rather, </b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the meaning is that when it is <b>unloaded, </b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to load it <b>for free; rather, </b> he may do so <b>for remuneration. </b> About <b>whom did you hear that he holds that</b> line of <b>reasoning? </b> It is <b>the Rabbis. </b> Apparently, the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis and not the opinion of R' Yosei HaGelili. The Talmud answers: <b>Actually, </b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili, and in</b> the matter of <b>loading he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | that it is stated: “Neither shall a man don a woman’s garment” | Makkot 20b:5 | <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who removes a scissorsful</b> of hair <b>on Shabbat is liable. And how much is a scissorsful? </b> It is <b>two</b> hairs. <b>R' Eliezer says: One</b> hair. <b>And the Rabbis concede to R' Eliezer in</b> the case of <b>one who removes white</b> hairs <b>from black</b> ones, <b>even</b> if he removes <b>one</b> hair, <b>that he is liable. </b> Since his intent was to remove that particular hair, its removal constitutes a complete action. The Talmud adds: <b>And</b> for a man, <b>that matter is prohibited even during the week, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “Neither shall a man don a woman’s garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:5). Removal of white hairs for the purposes of beautification is characteristic of women, and it is prohibited for a man to perform those actions. |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | is flogged | Nazir 58b:10 | § <b>Rav said: A person</b> who is not a nazirite <b>may lighten</b> his burden by removing <b>all</b> the hair of <b>his body with a razor. </b> One who feels he has too much hair may shave all of it off with a razor, apart from his beard and the corners of his head. The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a <i>baraita</i>: A man <b>who removes</b> the hair <b>of the armpit or the pubic</b> hair <b>is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “A man shall not put on a woman’s garment” (Deuteronomy 22:5), as this behavior is the manner of women. |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | “A man shall not put on a woman’s garment” | Nazir 59a:1 | <b>Some say</b> a different version of this statement: <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> A man <b>who removes</b> the hair <b>of the armpit or the pubic</b> hair <b>is flogged, due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“A man shall not put on a woman’s garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:5). The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The removal of hair is not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law but by rabbinic law. </b> How then does R' Yoḥanan say that he is flogged, which by definition is a punishment for individuals who have transgressed a Torah law? The Talmud answers: It was <b>he who said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A man <b>who removes</b> the hair <b>of the armpit or the pubic</b> hair <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “A man shall not put on a woman’s garment. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | “A woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, | Nazir 59a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And what</b> does <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, </b> who holds that the prohibition is by rabbinic law, <b>learn from this</b> verse: <b>“A man shall not put on</b> a woman’s garment”? The Talmud answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where it states: <b>“A woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, </b> and a man shall not put on a woman’s garment, for whoever does these things is an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 22:5). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>If</b> it teaches only <b>that a man may not put on a woman’s garment, and a woman</b> may not wear <b>a man’s garment, it is already stated</b> in explanation of this prohibition that <b>“it is an abomination</b> to YHWH your God,” <b>and there is no abomination here</b> in the mere act of wearing a garment. |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | beautify himself, it is prohibited. | Shabbat 50b:10 | Mar Zutra <b>holds in accordance with that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may scrape off</b> dried <b>excrement crusts and scabs of a wound that are on his flesh because of</b> the <b>pain</b> that they are causing <b>him. </b> However, <b>if</b> he does so in order <b>to</b> clean and <b>beautify himself, it is prohibited. </b> According to the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i>, it is prohibited to adorn or beautify oneself, as the verse: “Neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment” (Deuteronomy 22:5) prohibits dressing or conducting oneself in the manner of women. |
| Deuteronomy 22:5 | and a man shall not wear a woman’s garment” | Shabbat 94b:9 | <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who removes</b> enough of his hair <b>to fill the opening of the scissors on Shabbat is liable. And how much</b> is enough <b>to fill the opening of the scissors? </b> It is <b>two</b> hairs. <b>R' Eliezer says: </b> One is liable for removing even <b>one</b> hair. <b>And the rabbis agree with R' Eliezer</b> that <b>one</b> who <b>collects</b> and plucks <b>white</b> hairs <b>from among black</b> ones <b>is liable even</b> if he removed <b>a single</b> hair. His actions indicate that one hair is significant for him. <b>And this matter</b> of plucking white hairs <b>is prohibited</b> for men <b>even on weekdays, as it is stated: </b> “A woman shall not don a man’s clothes, <b>and a man shall not wear a woman’s garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:5). The rabbis derive that any action typically performed by women for beautification is prohibited for men. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | “If it happened | Bava Metzia102a:19 | The Talmud explains the question: <b>And if it is so, that this</b> ruling <b>that R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says</b> is correct, i.e., that <b>a person’s courtyard effects acquisition for him</b> of an item placed in it even <b>without his knowledge, </b> then a dovecote or attic will effect acquisition for its owner of any eggs inside them. Accordingly, one should <b>apply here</b> the principle that the mitzva to dispatch the mother bird from upon her nest applies only: <b>“If it happened</b> before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6) which <b>excludes</b> a bird or egg that is <b>readily accessible, </b> such as one that one owns, from the mitzva to dispatch the mother. Yet the <i>baraita</i> rules that the mitzva does apply in this case. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | “If a bird’s nest happens | Chullin 139a:2 | § With regard to the statement of the Mishnah that sacrificial birds are not included in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest, the Talmud asks: <b>What are the circumstances of these sacrificial</b> birds discussed in the Mishnah? <b>If we say that</b> the Mishnah is referring to a case where one <b>had a nest in his house and consecrated it, is one obligated</b> to send away even a non-sacred bird in such a case? The verse states: <b>“If a bird’s nest happens</b> before you on the way” (Deuteronomy 22:6), which <b>excludes</b> a nest readily <b>available</b> in one’s home. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | Rabbi Yitzḥak said: As the verse states: “If a bird’s [ tzippor ] nest happens before you” | Chullin 139b:16 | § The Mishnah states: If one encounters a nest of <b>a non-kosher bird, </b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. The Talmud asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>R' Yitzḥak said: As the verse states: “If a bird’s [<i>tzippor</i>] nest happens before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:6), and not: If a bird’s [<i>of</i> ] nest happens before you. The word <b><i>of</i> indicates to us</b> that all birds are included, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher. </b> But with regard to the word <b><i>tzippor</i>, we have found</b> that <b>a kosher</b> bird <b>is called a <i>tzippor</i>, </b> but <b>we have not found</b> that <b>a non-kosher</b> bird <b>is called a <i>tzippor</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | “ tzippor ” | Chullin 140a:14 | § The Mishnah states: If <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher bird, </b> or a kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird, one is exempt from sending away the bird. The Talmud objects: <b>Granted, </b> it is understandable that one is exempt in a case where <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher</b> bird, since <b>we require</b> a kosher bird, as the verse uses the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:6) in this context, which the Talmud earlier (139b) interpreted as a reference to a kosher bird, <b>and</b> this bird <b>is not</b> kosher. <b>But</b> in a case where <b>a kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird, it is a <i>tzippor</i>, </b> a kosher bird, and one should be required to send it away. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | nest | Chullin 140b:13 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If the mother bird <b>was hovering</b> over the eggs or fledglings in the nest, <b>when its wings are touching</b> the eggs or fledglings <b>in the nest, </b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother. When its wings <b>are not touching</b> the eggs or fledglings <b>in the nest, </b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother. Even if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg, </b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother, <b>as it is stated: </b> “If a bird’s <b>nest</b> happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), indicating that one is obligated to send away the mother bird from the <b>nest in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | resting | Chullin 140b:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah discusses the case of a mother bird that hovers over the nest. With regard to this, <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse teaches that one is obligated to send away the mother bird only when it is at rest, as it states: “And the mother is <b>resting</b> upon the fledglings” (Deuteronomy 22:6), <b>and not</b> when it is <b>hovering. </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that one is exempt <b>even</b> if the mother is hovering and <b>its wings are touching the nest. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Resting, ”</b> indicating that in fact one is obligated in the mitzva in such a case. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation, </b> i.e., how is this derived from the word “resting”? The Talmud responds: It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the word <b>sitting is not written</b> in the verse. Although a bird whose wings are touching the nest is not sitting upon it, such a bird is considered to be resting upon it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | exempt from sending | Chullin 140b:17 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rav from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If the mother bird <b>was sitting among</b> the eggs or the fledglings, one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away, as the verse states: “And the mother is resting upon the fledglings, or upon the eggs” (Deuteronomy 22:6), i.e., upon and not among. If it was sitting <b>above them, </b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> it away. If it <b>was hovering, even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest, </b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | fledgling | Chullin 141a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches: Even if <b>there is</b> only one <b>fledgling</b> or one egg, one is obligated to send away the mother, as it is stated: “If a bird’s nest happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), indicating that one is obligated to send the mother bird away from the nest in any case. Additionally, if there were fledglings capable of flying or unfertilized eggs, one is exempt from sending away the mother bird, as it is stated in the same verse: “And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs. ” From the juxtaposition of the fledglings and the eggs, one derives that the eggs or fledglings must be capable of living and they must require their mothers. With regard to this, <b>one of the rabbis said to Rava: Say the opposite, </b> that if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg, </b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother, <b>since we require</b> that the mother be “resting upon the <b>fledglings or</b> upon the <b>eggs, ” and</b> this condition is <b>not</b> fulfilled with fewer than two. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | and thereafter caught it. Rav Yehuda flogged him | Chullin 141b:10 | § The Talmud relates: <b>A certain</b> person <b>clipped</b> a mother bird’s <b>wing and sent it</b> away <b>and thereafter caught it. Rav Yehuda flogged him</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with the young” (Deuteronomy 22:6). Rav Yehuda also <b>said to him: Go</b> and let <b>its wings grow</b> back <b>and</b> then <b>send it</b> away. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | a single egg is placed | Chullin 141b:12 | The Talmud relates that <b>a certain</b> man <b>came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a certain kosher bird known as the <b><i>teima</i>? </b> Is it included in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest? Rava <b>said: Doesn’t this man know that</b> with regard to any <b>kosher bird one is obligated to send</b> away the mother? The man responded: Nevertheless, I am uncertain with regard to the <i>halakha</i>. Rava <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> you are uncertain about a case where <b>a single egg is placed</b> in the nest, since the Torah states: “Upon the fledglings or upon the eggs” (Deuteronomy 22:6). The man replied in the affirmative. Rava <b>said to him: That</b> too should be <b>known to you, </b> as <b>it is</b> stated in <b>the Mishnah</b> (140b): Even if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg, </b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | happens | Chullin 141b:15 | The Talmud objects: <b>But if it is so that this</b> ruling is correct <b>that R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says, </b> i.e., that <b>a person’s courtyard effects acquisition for him</b> of an item placed in it even <b>without his knowledge, </b> then a dovecote or attic will effect acquisition for its owner of any eggs inside them. Accordingly, one should <b>apply here</b> the principle that the mitzva to send away the mother bird from the nest applies only in the case described in the verse: <b>“If</b> a bird’s nest <b>happens</b> before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), which <b>excludes</b> from the mitzva a bird or egg readily <b>available</b> in one’s home. Yet the <i>baraita</i> rules that the mitzva does apply in this case. |
| Deuteronomy 22:6 | but not to males, | Chullin 78b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis, </b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>? Their reasoning is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring would apply both to males and to females. </b> But could one not derive <b>this</b> by <b>logical inference, </b> reaching the opposite conclusion: The Torah <b>rendered one obligated here</b> not to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks</b> not to seize them together, but to dispatch the mother. <b>Just as when it rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks, </b> the obligation applies <b>to female</b> birds <b>but not to males, </b> as the verse states: “And the mother sitting on the chicks” (Deuteronomy 22:6), <b>so too, when it rendered one obligated here, </b> with regard to an animal and its offspring, the obligation should apply <b>to female</b> animals, <b>but not to males. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | take the young for yourself” | Bava Metzia102a:23 | <b>And now that Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: It is prohibited to acquire the eggs as long as the mother bird is upon them, as it is</b> first <b>stated: “Send away the mother” and</b> only <b>then: </b> “And <b>take the young for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), <b>even</b> if <b>you say that</b> the eggs fully emerged and <b>fell into his courtyard, </b> he will not acquire them, because in <b>any case</b> in which a courtyard owner <b>is able to acquire</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard can effect acquisition</b> of it <b>for him, but</b> in <b>any case</b> in which <b>he is unable to acquire</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard cannot effect acquisition</b> of it <b>for him either. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | “You shall dispatch [ shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ ] | Bava Metzia31a:15 | The Talmud cites additional mitzvot where the Torah employs the compound verb form, and the rabbis derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from the phrasing of the verse. With regard to the mitzva of dispatch of the mother bird from the nest before taking its eggs or fledglings, the verse states: <b>“You shall dispatch [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>]</b> the mother, but the young take for yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days” (Deuteronomy 22:7). The Talmud understands that from the use of the compound form of the verb, “<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>,” the rabbis derive that one must dispatch the mother bird multiple times if it returns. The Talmud asks: <b>Say</b> that from <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>”</b> one derives the obligation to dispatch the mother <b>once, </b> and from <b>“<i>teshallaḥ</i>”</b> one derives the obligation to dispatch the mother <b>twice, </b> and beyond that there is no obligation. |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | As the verse states: “You shall send the mother” | Chullin 138b:10 | § The Mishnah states that the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest applies <b>to non-sacred</b> birds, <b>but not to sacrificial</b> birds. The Talmud asks: <b>Why</b> does this mitzva <b>not</b> apply to sacrificial birds? The Talmud responds: <b>As the verse states: “You shall send the mother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). The verse refers only <b>to</b> a bird <b>that you are commanded to send</b> away, i.e., a non-sacred bird; that <b>excludes this</b> sacrificial bird, <b>which you are not commanded to send</b> away, but <b>rather to bring it to the custody of</b> the Temple <b>treasurer. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | you may take for yourself” | Chullin 140a:15 | The Talmud responds that this is in accordance with <b>that which Rav Kahana said</b> in a different context: The verse states: “But the young <b>you may take for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), indicating that one is required to send away the mother only if the eggs are fit for consumption, <b>but not</b> if they are fit only <b>for your dog. Here too, </b> with regard to non-kosher eggs, the mitzva applies only if <b>you may take for yourself, but not</b> if they are fit only <b>for your dog</b> because they are not kosher. |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | because he holds | Chullin 141a:18 | The second possibility is now presented: <b>Or perhaps in general</b> R' Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva; and here, this is the reason</b> one is flogged for taking the mother: It is <b>because he holds</b> that when the verse states: “You shall send the mother [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:7), the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to sending the mother bird applies only <b>at the outset, </b> i.e., when encountering the nest. Accordingly, this is not a case of a prohibition that entails the performance of a positive mitzva, but an independent prohibition, for which one is liable to receive lashes. |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | as it is stated: “You shall send [ shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ ] the mother” | Chullin 141a:5 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If <b>one sent</b> away the mother bird <b>and it returned</b> to rest on the eggs, <b>even</b> if it returned <b>four or five times, </b> one is <b>obligated</b> to send it away again, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>] the mother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). The doubled verb indicates that one must send away the mother bird multiple times if needed. If one <b>said: I am hereby taking the mother and sending</b> away <b>the offspring, </b> he is still <b>obligated</b> to send away the mother even if he sent away the offspring, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send the mother. ”</b> If one sent away the mother and <b>took the offspring and</b> then <b>returned them</b> to the mother’s nest, <b>and thereafter the mother returned</b> and rested <b>upon them, </b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | then: “The young you may take for yourself” | Chullin 141b:18 | The Talmud adds: <b>And now that Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited to acquire eggs whose mother is resting upon them, as it is stated: </b> “You shall <b>send the mother, ” and</b> only <b>then: “The young you may take for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), <b>you</b> may <b>even say: Even though</b> the eggs fully emerged and <b>fell into his courtyard, </b> he must still send away the mother bird. This is because in <b>any case in which</b> a courtyard owner <b>is capable of acquiring</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard can also effect acquisition</b> of it for him. <b>But</b> in <b>any case</b> in which <b>he is incapable of acquiring</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard cannot effect acquisition</b> of it <b>for him either. </b> Since one is incapable of acquiring the eggs so long as the mother bird is resting upon them, one’s property does not acquire the eggs for him even if they have already fallen into it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | the Torah says: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days” | Chullin 142a:2 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>A person may not take the mother</b> bird <b>with the offspring even</b> if he takes the mother for use as part of the ritual <b>to purify the metzora. </b> The Mishnah compares the reward for performing the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest to the reward for performing other mitzvot: <b>And if</b> with regard to the sending away of the mother bird, which is <b>a mitzva</b> whose performance is <b>simple, as</b> it entails a loss of no more than <b>an <i>issar</i>, </b> i.e., the value of the mother bird, <b>the Torah says: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), it may be derived by <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the reward is no less <b>for</b> the fulfillment <b>of the mitzvot in the Torah</b> whose performance is <b>demanding. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | the nest, it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days” | Chullin 142a:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>The school of R' Ya’akov taught that</b> R' Ya’akov <b>says: There is not a single mitzva</b> written <b>in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on</b> a belief in <b>the resurrection of the dead, </b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest, it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | the nest it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days” | Kiddushin 39b:7 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Ya’akov says: There is not a single mitzva written in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on the resurrection of the dead, </b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). |
| Deuteronomy 22:7 | the nest it is also written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days” | Kiddushin 40a:7 | Rava asked: <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is also written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), so <b>let him also teach this</b> mitzva. Rav Naḥman answered: He <b>taught</b> some cases <b>and omitted</b> others, i.e., the <i>tanna</i> did not list everything. Rava said to him: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught: These</b> are the <b>matters, </b> which indicates that only these mitzvot are included, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>he taught</b> some <b>and omitted</b> others? |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? The verse states: “You shall not bring blood into your house” | Bava Kamma15b:18 | The justification for this is <b>from</b> the ruling <b>of R' Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? The verse states: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), i.e., one may not allow a hazardous situation or item to remain in one’s house. As long as the hazard remains, the owner is in violation of this verse and therefore the court may excommunicate him for failing to remove the danger. |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house” | Bava Kamma46a:5 | <b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejected Rabba’s explanation of R' Eliezer’s opinion, and <b>said</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Eliezer: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and</b> that <b>one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), which means that one may not allow a hazardous situation to remain in his house. Similarly, a person should not keep a forewarned ox in his possession, as it is dangerous. This is why R' Eliezer rules that no level of safeguarding is sufficient for it; the ox should be slaughtered so that it will not cause damage. |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | raised an objection to | Bava Kamma51a:5 | Rava again <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Naḥman: The Torah requires constructing a parapet on the roof of one’s house to prevent anyone from falling to his death, as the verse states (Deuteronomy 22:8): “You shall not bring blood upon your house, <b>if any man falls from it. ”</b> The term <b>“from it”</b> teaches that liability exists only for falling from the roof of the house, <b>but not onto</b> the roof of a house. |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | for your roof [ legaggekha ],” | Chullin 136a:11 | Similarly, with regard to the obligation of establishing <b>a parapet</b> around a roof, R' Ilai concedes that the joint owners of a roof are obligated, <b>even though God writes: </b> “When you build a new house, then you shall make a parapet <b>for your roof [<i>legaggekha</i>], ”</b> using the singular pronoun, “and you shall not bring blood upon your house, if any man falls from there” (Deuteronomy 22:8). One might have inferred from the singular form that with regard to <b>your</b> roof, <b>yes, </b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | that you shall not place blood in your house” | Ketubot 41b:9 | The Talmud adds: <b>Either way, </b> whether or not he agrees to go to Eretz Yisrael, if he keeps the cause of the damage, <b>we</b> in Babylonia <b>excommunicate him, as we say to him: Remove your</b> cause of <b>damage, </b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Natan. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a person may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and may not place an unsteady ladder in his house? </b> It is <b>as it is stated: </b> “And you shall make a parapet for your roof <b>that you shall not place blood in your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8). It is prohibited to leave a potentially dangerous object in one’s house, and one who refuses to remove it is excommunicated. |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | a parapet | Kiddushin 34a:2 | <b>And what is a positive mitzva that is not time bound? </b> Examples include the affixing of <b>a <i>mezuza</i></b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), the construction of <b>a parapet</b> on a roof (Deuteronomy 22:8), returning <b>a lost item</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1–3), <b>and the release</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest, </b> i.e., the mitzva of sending away a mother bird when one finds it sitting on chicks or eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6–7). |
| Deuteronomy 22:8 | if the fallen falls mimenu ” | Shabbat 32a:5 | In a similar vein, <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said: A person should always pray that he will not become ill, as if he becomes ill they say to him: Bring</b> proof of your <b>virtue and exempt yourself. </b> It is preferable for a person not to be forced to prove that he merits staying alive, as he might not be able to prove it. <b>Mar Ukva said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? As it says: “When you build a new house, then you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you bring not blood upon your house, <b>if the fallen falls <i>mimenu</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8). He explains: <b><i>Mimenu</i>, from him proof must be brought. </b> When one falls from his previous situation, it is his own responsibility to prove his innocence and emerge unharmed. <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught: </b> What is the meaning of the phrase: <b>If the fallen falls from it? This</b> person <b>was destined to fall</b> from that roof <b>from the six days of Creation, </b> it was ingrained into nature. <b>As, </b> although <b>he did not</b> yet <b>fall, the verse calls him fallen. Nevertheless, </b> the owner of the house is indicted for this, as <b>merit is engendered by means of</b> the <b>innocent and guilt by means of</b> the <b>guilty. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Rabbi Yoshiya, who says | Bekhorot 54a:2 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But</b> this derivation is problematic <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoshiya, who says</b> that the verse: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds” (Deuteronomy 22:9), means that one who sows diverse kinds is not liable by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat and barley and</b> a grape <b>seed with a single hand motion. </b> According to this opinion, the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid; consequently, <b>how does he derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one may not tithe grain for wine or grain for grain? |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Rabbi Yoshiya with regard to diverse kinds, as it is written: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds” | Berakhot 22a:13 | <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoshiya with regard to diverse kinds, as it is written: “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). <b>R' Yoshiya says: </b> This means that <b>one</b> who sows diverse kinds <b>is not liable</b> by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat and barley and a</b> grape <b>pit with a single hand motion, </b> meaning that while sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | with the produce [ utevuat ] of the vineyard” | Berakhot 35a:5 | <b>And according to the one who taught: A 4th year grapevine, this</b> works out <b>well if he derives</b> this matter <b>from a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>], </b> and therefore need not derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It is stated here</b> with regard to the laws of the prohibition of fruit for the tree’s first three years: “But in the 5th year you may eat its fruit, <b>so that it may increase your produce [<i>tevuato</i>]; </b> I am YHWH your God” (Leviticus 19:25). <b>And it is stated below, </b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forfeited <b>with the produce [<i>utevuat</i>] of the vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). Based on a verbal analogy, it can be derived: <b>Just as below, </b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards; so too, here, </b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the fruits of a sapling, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards. </b> Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, <b>one extra <i>hillul</i></b> remains from which to derive <b>the blessing. </b> Since he derives that the laws of 4th-year saplings apply only to grapes from the verbal analogy, he can derive the requirement to recite blessings before partaking of food from the word <i>hillulim</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | be forfeited [ pen tikdash ]” | Chullin 115a:5 | The Talmud challenges: <b>Diverse kinds of seeds</b> sown together <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>as</b> this <b>is</b> a matter whose practice <b>I have made abominable to you. </b> The Talmud explains: One learns otherwise <b>from</b> the fact <b>that God revealed with regard to diverse kinds in a vineyard: </b> “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed; <b>lest</b> the growth of the seed that you will sow <b>be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). The rabbis read the phrase “be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]” as though it states: <b>Lest it be burned [<i>pen tukad esh</i>], </b> indicating that diverse kinds in a vineyard must be destroyed so that no benefit is derived from them. Since this is stated specifically with regard to a vineyard, one can conclude <b>by inference that</b> other <b>diverse kinds of seeds are permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Abaye said: Two verses are written, | Chullin 116a:5 | <b>Abaye said: Two verses are written, </b> i.e., two separate terms in one verse indicate two separate prohibitions: The verse states: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you will sow be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard” (Deuteronomy 22:9). <b>It is written: “Lest the growth be forfeited, ”</b> indicating that it is prohibited only if it has grown, <b>and it is written: “Of the seed, ”</b> from which it can be inferred that it is prohibited immediately when it is planted and takes root. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | there, | Eruvin 3b:17 | The Mishnah explains: <b>What is a clearing in a vineyard? </b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines. If <b>there are not sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there, </b> due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <b>there were sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area, </b> i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <b>and he sows the rest</b> of the cleared area with foreign crops. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | there, | Eruvin 93a:8 | The Mishnah explains: <b>And what is a clearing in a vineyard? </b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines.

| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Ḥizkiyya said: The verse states: | Kiddushin 56b:5 | The Mishnah stated that one may not betroth a woman <b>with diverse kinds in a vineyard. From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from diverse kinds in a vineyard? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: The verse states: </b> “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds; lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forbidden [<i>pen tikdash</i>], together with the yield of the vineyard” (Deuteronomy 22:9). Ḥizkiyya expounds <b>“lest</b> the growth of the seed that you have sown <b>be forbidden [<i>pen tikdash</i>]”</b> as: <b>Lest it be burned [<i>pen tukad esh</i>], </b> indicating that the seed of diverse kinds must be destroyed by fire, so that no benefit is derived from it. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [ orla ]; and forbidden food crops in a vineyard | Nedarim 58a:1 | For <b>any item that can become permitted, </b> i.e., a forbidden object whose prohibition can or will lapse, <b>for example, untithed produce</b> that can be permitted through tithing, <b>and second tithe</b> that is permitted through redemption or bringing it to Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 14:24–26), <b>and consecrated items</b> that are also permitted through redemption, <b>and</b> produce of the <b>new</b> crop that is permitted after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering (Leviticus 23:14), <b>the rabbis did not determine a measure for their</b> neutralization, and no mixture with any quantity of permitted items neutralizes their prohibition. <b>And</b> for <b>any item that cannot become permitted, for example, <i>teruma</i>, and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and <i>ḥalla</i></b> (Numbers 15:20–21); <b>fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>]; and forbidden food crops in a vineyard</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9), <b>the rabbis determined a measure for their</b> neutralization. |
| Deuteronomy 22:9 | Rava said: Two verses are written | Pesachim 25a:9 | <b>Rava said: Two verses are written</b> about this <i>halakha</i>, i.e., two separate terms in one verse indicate two separate prohibitions. The verse states: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed; lest the fullness of the seed which you have sown be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard” (Deuteronomy 22:9). <b>It is written: “The seed, ”</b> indicating that it is prohibited once it is planted and takes root, <b>and it is written: “The fullness, ”</b> indicating that it is prohibited only if it has grown. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> two terms be reconciled? If it were <b>planted initially</b> in the vineyard, it becomes prohibited immediately <b>upon taking root. </b> If it were <b>planted</b> elsewhere <b>and brought</b> into the vineyard later, such as in a perforated pot, then the following distinction applies: If <b>its</b> size <b>increases</b> in the vineyard, <b>yes, </b> it is prohibited; if <b>its</b> size <b>does not increase, no, </b> it is not prohibited. |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | incurs the forty | Bava Metzia8b:4 | <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Yehuda said to me: </b> Although I do not remember what Shmuel said, <b>let us see</b> if we can analyze this <b>ourselves, as we learned</b> in a Mishnah concerning the prohibition against leading animals of diverse kinds (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:3): If two animals of diverse kinds, e.g., a horse and a donkey, are harnessed to the same wagon, <b>the one leading</b> the animals <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes for transgressing the Torah prohibition: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10), <b>and the one sitting in the wagon [<i>bakaron</i>]</b> also <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes. <b>R' Meir deems the one sitting in the wagon exempt, </b> as he did not perform any action. |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | together. | Chullin 78b:6 | <b>R' Yonatan says: </b> There is no need for this derivation, because the phrase “his father and his mother” <b>indicates</b> that one is liable if he curses <b>both of them together, and it</b> also <b>indicates</b> that he is liable if he curses either <b>one</b> of them <b>on their own, unless the verse specifies</b> that one is liable only if he curses both <b>together. </b> An example of a verse where the Torah specifies that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to the two elements in conjunction is: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10). According to R' Yonatan, had the verse stated with regard to a mother and its offspring: A bull and a sheep, and not: A bull or a sheep, one would still be liable for slaughtering each with its own offspring independently. Therefore, the word “or” is superfluous, and is utilized by Ḥananya, who agrees with the opinion of R' Yonatan, to include the offspring of diverse kinds in this prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | plowing with an ox and a donkey, | Makkot 21b:1 | Apropos the case where one receives several sets of lashes for performing a single action, the Mishnah continues: <b>There is</b> one who <b>plows a single furrow and is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> violating <b>eight prohibitions. </b> How so? For <b>plowing with an ox and a donkey, </b> in violation of the prohibition: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10); <b>and they are consecrated, </b> and therefore he is guilty of misuse of consecrated property; <b>and</b> he is plowing <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard; and</b> it is <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, when it is prohibited to work the land; <b>and</b> it is on <b>a Festival, </b> when plowing is a prohibited labor; <b>and</b> he is both <b>a priest and a nazirite</b> and is performing the plowing <b>in a place of impurity</b> imparted by a corpse, which is prohibited for both a priest (see Leviticus 21:1) and a nazirite (see Numbers 6:6). |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | one who plows with an ox and a donkey, | Pesachim 47a:8 | <b>Rav Ḥisda sent</b> a question <b>to Rabba with Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna: Do we say</b> the principle: <b>Since, etc.? Didn’t we learn</b> in a Mishnah: <b>There is</b> a case in which one <b>plows one furrow and is liable for</b> violating <b>eight prohibitions</b> with this single act? The Mishnah explains that this applies to <b>one who plows with an ox and a donkey, </b> thereby violating the prohibition: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10), <b>and they were consecrated, </b> in which case plowing with them constitutes misuse of consecrated property. If his plowing aids the growth of <b>food crops in a vineyard, </b> he has transgressed a 3rd prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | voice, | Sanhedrin 65b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And is</b> projecting one’s <b>voice not</b> considered <b>an action according to R' Yoḥanan? But wasn’t it stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the following case: If one <b>muzzled</b> an animal <b>by</b> projecting his <b>voice, </b> by berating it whenever it tried to eat, has he transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4)? <b>And</b> similarly, if one <b>led</b> different species to work together <b>by</b> projecting his <b>voice, </b> without performing any action, has he transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10)? <b>R' Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, and Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | together. | Shevuot 27b:1 | <b>unless the verse specifies</b> that one is liable only if he curses both <b>together. </b> An example of a verse where the Torah specifies that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to the two elements in conjunction is: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10). |
| Deuteronomy 22:10 | plowing with an ox and a donkey | Temurah 28a:16 | The Talmud explains: The case of one who violates the prohibition of <b>plowing with an ox and a donkey</b> together (Deuteronomy 22:10) <b>shall prove</b> that the above claim is invalid. This is a case <b>where a transgression was committed with</b> the ox, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> to sacrifice it <b>upon the altar. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | as it is stated: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, | Bekhorot 17a:16 | The Talmud cites a series of statements discussing an animal that resembles another species. <b>R' Aḥa bar Yaakov says: Everyone concedes that one is not flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds for</b> wearing <b>its wool</b> together with linen, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, </b> wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11). <b>Just as linen</b> is a material <b>that has not changed, so too, </b> one is liable only for wearing <b>wool</b> from an animal <b>that has not changed, </b> i.e., an animal whose appearance does not differ from that of its progenitors. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | it is written: “Wool and linen” | Menachot 39b:11 | The Talmud rejects this: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument, </b> because one can maintain that other fabrics also fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes by Torah law, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). The term <b>“the corner”</b> indicates that the fringe must be from the same <b>type</b> of fabric as the <b>corner. And</b> yet <b>it is written: “Wool and linen”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), immediately before the verse states: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:12), indicating that ritual fringes must be from either wool or linen. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | as it is prohibited for an ordinary person | Menachot 5b:24 | <b>Rav Adda bar Abba said</b> that this is the response mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that the prohibition against <b>diverse kinds proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived from the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it is prohibited for an ordinary person</b> to wear garments sewn from a mixture of diverse kinds (Deuteronomy 22:11), <b>and</b> yet such garments are <b>permitted for the Most High, </b> as the belt of the priestly vestments was fashioned from a mixture of diverse kinds. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | “You shall not wear diverse kinds | Nazir 41b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R' Eliezer, from where does he</b> derive the general principle <b>that a positive</b> mitzva <b>will come and override a prohibition? </b> The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the mitzva of ritual <b>fringes. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This verse: <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen” (Deuteronomy 22:11), |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | As the verse states: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, | Nazir 58a:6 | The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the case of ritual <b>fringes. </b> How so? <b>As the verse states: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, </b> wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that although the command <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds”</b> applies to most cases, the juxtaposed verse: <b>“You shall make for you fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), teaches that one may prepare ritual fringes even <b>from</b> diverse kinds of wool and linen. This teaches that the positive mitzva of ritual fringes overrides the prohibition of diverse kinds. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | wool and linen together” | Nazir 58a:8 | <b>As Rava raises a contradiction: It is written: “And that they put on the fringe of each corner</b> a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:38). The phrase “the fringe of each corner” indicates that ritual fringes must be of the same <b>type as the corner</b> of the robe itself, upon which they must place <b>“a thread of sky blue. ” And</b> yet <b>it is written: </b> “You shall not wear diverse kinds, <b>wool and linen together”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11). The juxtaposition of these two verses teaches that ritual fringes must be made from wool and linen. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | is written: “Diverse kinds [ sha’atnez ]” | Niddah 61b:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in this case of uncertainty? <b>By Torah law, </b> it <b>is written: “Diverse kinds [<i>sha’atnez</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), and this is interpreted as an acronym indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of diverse kinds does not apply <b>unless</b> the item <b>is</b> combed <b>smooth [<i>shua</i>], spun [<i>tavui</i>]</b> as a thread, <b>and woven [<i>nuz</i>]. </b> Without these characteristics, the combination is not considered diverse kinds by Torah law. <b>And it is the rabbis who decreed</b> that diverse kinds that are merely attached to each other are prohibited, despite the fact that they are not combed and spun together. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>since he does not know if it</b> all <b>fell out</b> it is <b>permitted, </b> as the <i>halakha</i> is lenient with regard to uncertainties involving prohibitions that are by rabbinic law. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together” | Shabbat 27a:10 | <b>Rav Pappa</b> himself understood the first statement of the <i>tanna</i> of the school of R' Yishmael and <b>stated</b> it in a completely different manner. In his opinion, the derivation from the <i>halakhot</i> of tzara'at, which concluded that <b>even all</b> nonspecific mentions of garments in the Torah refer to wool or linen, came <b>to include</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>diverse kinds, </b> the Torah prohibition to wear clothing made from a mixture of wool and linen threads. He sought to prove that the <i>halakhot</i> of prohibited mixtures of threads apply only to wool and linen. The Talmud asks: Why does he require this derivation with regard to the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds? </b> The fact that the prohibition is limited to wool and linen is <b>explicitly written, </b> as it is stated: <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11). The Talmud answers: Nevertheless, an additional derivation was necessary, as <b>it would have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this, </b> the restriction of the prohibition of diverse kinds to wool and linen, <b>applies</b> specifically to a case when one uses them together <b>in the manner of wearing</b> them; <b>however, in</b> merely <b>placing</b> the garments upon oneself, <b>any two kinds are prohibited. </b> Therefore, it was necessary to derive that the garment mentioned is restricted to wool and linen. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen | Shabbat 27b:1 | garments mentioned in the Torah are made from wool and linen. This comes <b>to include</b> the law of <b>ritual fringes; </b> the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to those materials. The Talmud asks: Why is that derivation necessary? With regard to <b>ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen</b> together” (Deuteronomy 22:11); <b>and</b> juxtaposed to it, <b>it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes</b> upon the four corners of your covering, with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). From the juxtaposition of these two verses it is derived that the mitzva of ritual fringes applies only to garments to which the laws of diverse kinds apply. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak responded that the matter is not so clear, as <b>it could have entered your mind to say in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction: </b> On the one hand, <b>it is written: </b> “And that they put with the fringe of each <b>corner</b> a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:39); apparently, the threads of the ritual fringes must be of the same <b>type</b> of fabric as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. <b>However, </b> in Deuteronomy, in the laws of ritual fringes, <b>it is written</b> in juxtaposition to the laws of diverse kinds: <b>Wool and linen together. </b> The ritual fringes may only be made of those materials. <b>How</b> can <b>that</b> contradiction be resolved? Rather, Rava says: Ritual fringes made of <b>wool and linen exempt</b> the garment and fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes <b>whether</b> the garment is <b>of their own type, </b> wool or linen, <b>whether it is not of their own type. </b> Whereas with regard to <b>other types, </b> a garment of <b>their</b> own <b>type, they exempt; </b> a garment <b>not</b> of <b>their</b> own <b>type, they do not exempt. It would have entered your mind</b> to explain this <b>in accordance with</b> the approach of <b>Rava. </b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> that the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to wool and linen and not to other materials. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | it is written: “Wool and linen” | Yevamot 4b:11 | § Returning to the question, the Talmud explains that the mention of wool and linen <b>is necessary, </b> as it could <b>enter your mind to state</b> an argument <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction</b> from the following verse: <b>It is written: </b> “That they make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments” (Numbers 15:38). The phrase <b>“the corners”</b> indicates that it must be from the same <b>type</b> of thread as the <b>corner, </b> i.e., the threads of the fringes must consist of the same kind of material as the corner of the garment. <b>And</b> yet <b>it is written: “Wool and linen”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), which indicates that ritual fringes may be prepared from only those materials and no others. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | “You shall not wear diverse kinds, | Yevamot 4b:2 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is <b>because</b> it <b>is evident; as, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that no inference should be drawn from the adjacent verses, <b>let God write</b> this verse <b>by the portion of ritual fringes</b> (Numbers, chapter 15). With regard <b>to what <i>halakha</i></b> did the Torah <b>write it here? </b> Clearly, the Torah is teaching a <i>halakha</i> from the adjacent verses. <b>And if you wish, say</b> it is <b>because</b> this verse is <b>free, since</b> the Torah has already <b>written: “Neither shall there come upon you a garment of diverse kinds mingled together”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>Why, </b> then, <b>do I</b> need the verse: <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds, </b> wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11)? <b>Learn from this that</b> the verse is <b>free</b> for the derivation of a homiletic interpretation from juxtaposed verses. |
| Deuteronomy 22:11 | “diverse kinds” | Yevamot 4b:8 | The Talmud responds: <b>If so, let the verse be silent</b> and refrain <b>from</b> mentioning wool and linen at all, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only wearing wool and linen together is prohibited can <b>be derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“diverse kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), and <b>“diverse kinds”</b> from <b>placing</b> a covering of diverse kinds upon oneself (Leviticus 19:19). The repetition of wool and linen must be coming to teach that one should derive a homiletic interpretation from these juxtaposed verses. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | your covering [ kesutekha ]” | Chullin 136a:9 | Likewise, with regard to the mitzva to attach <b>ritual fringes</b> to one’s garment, R' Ilai concedes that a jointly owned garment is obligated, <b>even though God writes: </b> “You shall make yourself twisted cords upon the four corners of <b>your covering [<i>kesutekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), using the singular pronoun. It might have been inferred from the singular form that with regard to <b>your</b> covering, <b>yes, </b> it is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> it is <b>not</b> obligated. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | twisted cords” | Menachot 39b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana holds</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in one verse: “You shall prepare yourself <b>twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), <b>and</b> in another <b>it is written: </b> “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue <b>thread”</b> (Numbers 15:38), it teaches that the ritual fringes may be composed entirely of <b>either twisted cords, </b> i.e., the windings, <b>or</b> loose threads or <b>strings. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | the Torah states: | Menachot 40b:3 | <b>And</b> in such a case the ritual fringes would be unfit because <b>the Torah states: </b> “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12), which teaches: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared. </b> Consequently, the strings must be attached to the garment for the sake of the mitzva of ritual fringes. When the individual places the linen string there in order to stitch the garment and then decides to use it for the mitzva of ritual fringes and adds sky-blue wool strings, he does not fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes and violates the prohibition against wearing a garment of wool and linen. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “with which you cover yourself” | Menachot 41a:17 | <b>Rav Tovi bar Kisna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Garments</b> that are not being worn but are stored in <b>a box are required</b> to have <b>ritual fringes, </b> because the mitzva pertains to the garment, not the man. <b>But Shmuel concedes in</b> the case of <b>an old man, where</b> the garment <b>was made</b> as a shroud <b>in his honor, that</b> the shroud is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>God states</b> in the Torah that one must place ritual fringes on the corners of garments <b>“with which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12). <b>This</b> shroud <b>is not made for</b> the purpose of <b>covering</b> oneself. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “twisted cords” | Menachot 42a:11 | § With regard to attaching ritual fringes to a garment, the Talmud relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would affix four</b> strings to the garment, <b>and he would</b> first <b>fold them</b> in half <b>and</b> then <b>insert them</b> at the point of the folds <b>into</b> the hole of <b>the garment, </b> so that on one side there were eight strings and on the other side there were four loops. He would then take the eight strings <b>and loop them</b> through the four loops and pull them tight, thereby attaching them to the garment. The Talmud explains that <b>he held</b> that <b>we require eight</b> strings when they are initially placed <b>in the garment, in order that there be twisted cord</b> and <b>“twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), i.e., four doubled strings, <b>at the place, </b> i.e., the time, when he creates the <b>loose hanging string. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | with which you cover yourself” | Menachot 43a:20 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: One may ask: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse serves to <b>exclude a nighttime garment? Or is it</b> to <b>exclude only the garment of a blind person, </b> who is also unable to see his ritual fringes? The <i>tanna</i> explains: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: </b> “Of your covering, <b>with which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), the <b>garment of a blind person is mentioned</b> as being included, as the verse already stated: “Of your covering,” and did not need to state: “With which you cover yourself. ” If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the exclusion: <b>“That you may look upon it”? </b> It must <b>exclude a nighttime garment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “With which you cover yourself” | Menachot 43b:1 | <b>what do they do with, </b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12)? The Talmud answers that the Rabbis <b>require</b> it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“on the four corners of your garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12) indicates that one is required to attach ritual fringes to a garment that has <b>four</b> corners, <b>but not</b> to one that has <b>three</b> corners. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | which [ asher ] | Menachot 43b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>R' Shimon</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a five-cornered garment is required to have ritual fringes? The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the seemingly extraneous word: “With <b>which [<i>asher</i>]</b> you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Talmud answers: <b>They do not learn</b> any new <i>halakhot</i> from the word <b>“which [<i>asher</i>]. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | And anyone who does not have ritual fringes on his garments violates five positive mitzvot. | Menachot 44a:17 | <b>And anyone who does not have ritual fringes on his garments violates five positive mitzvot. </b> This is because the mitzva of ritual fringes is stated four times in the primary passage concerning ritual fringes in Numbers: “That they prepare for themselves strings…and they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread. And it shall be to you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of YHWH” (Numbers 15:38–39). An additional command appears in the verse: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12). |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “You shall make for yourself fringes” | Nazir 42a:1 | indicates that fringes in the mitzva stated in the adjacent verse: <b>“You shall make for yourself fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), can be <b>from them, </b> wool and linen. By juxtaposing the mitzva of ritual fringes to the prohibition against diverse kinds of cloth, the Torah teaches that the positive mitzva of ritual fringes, which includes dyed blue wool, overrides the prohibition against diverse kinds of cloth, i.e., one may attach woolen ritual fringes to a linen garment. From here one derives the general principle that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “You shall make for you fringes” | Nazir 58a:6 | The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the case of ritual <b>fringes. </b> How so? <b>As the verse states: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, </b> wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that although the command <b>“You shall not wear diverse kinds”</b> applies to most cases, the juxtaposed verse: <b>“You shall make for you fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), teaches that one may prepare ritual fringes even <b>from</b> diverse kinds of wool and linen. This teaches that the positive mitzva of ritual fringes overrides the prohibition of diverse kinds. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes | Shabbat 27b:1 | garments mentioned in the Torah are made from wool and linen. This comes <b>to include</b> the law of <b>ritual fringes; </b> the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to those materials. The Talmud asks: Why is that derivation necessary? With regard to <b>ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen</b> together” (Deuteronomy 22:11); <b>and</b> juxtaposed to it, <b>it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes</b> upon the four corners of your covering, with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). From the juxtaposition of these two verses it is derived that the mitzva of ritual fringes applies only to garments to which the laws of diverse kinds apply. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak responded that the matter is not so clear, as <b>it could have entered your mind to say in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction: </b> On the one hand, <b>it is written: </b> “And that they put with the fringe of each <b>corner</b> a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:39); apparently, the threads of the ritual fringes must be of the same <b>type</b> of fabric as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. <b>However, </b> in Deuteronomy, in the laws of ritual fringes, <b>it is written</b> in juxtaposition to the laws of diverse kinds: <b>Wool and linen together. </b> The ritual fringes may only be made of those materials. <b>How</b> can <b>that</b> contradiction be resolved? Rather, Rava says: Ritual fringes made of <b>wool and linen exempt</b> the garment and fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes <b>whether</b> the garment is <b>of their own type, </b> wool or linen, <b>whether it is not of their own type. </b> Whereas with regard to <b>other types, </b> a garment of <b>their</b> own <b>type, they exempt; </b> a garment <b>not</b> of <b>their</b> own <b>type, they do not exempt.

| Deuteronomy 22:12 | different there, as the verse states: “You shall prepare for you fringes” | Sukkah 9a:11 | The Talmud answers: It is <b>different there, as the verse states: “You shall prepare for you fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), from which it is derived: <b>“For you, ” for the sake of your obligation. </b> The fringes, from the beginning of their production, must be produced for the sake of the mitzva. The Talmud asks: <b>Here, too, </b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the verse says: <b>“You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). Shouldn’t it be derived: <b>“For you, ” for the sake of your obligation? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “twisted fringes” | Yevamot 5b:1 | they learn this <b>from the first verse, </b> which permits a mixture of diverse kinds of wool and linen in ritual fringes. As for the previous claim that in the opinion of the Rabbis the phrase “wool and linen” is not superfluous and therefore there is no cause to derive from the juxtaposed verses, the answer is as follows: <b>If so, </b> that no homiletical interpretation can be derived from this source, <b>let the verse say</b> only: <b>You shall make fringes for yourself. Why do I</b> need the expression <b>“twisted fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12)? <b>Conclude from</b> this <b>that</b> this phrase <b>is free, </b> i.e., a homiletical interpretation can be derived by the juxtaposition of verses due to this superfluous phrase. |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “With which you cover yourself” | Zevachim 18b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, who deems five-cornered garments exempt, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And it shall be unto you for a fringe, <b>that you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39). The phrase: “That you may look upon it,” serves to <b>exclude a night garment</b> from the obligation of ritual fringes, as the fringes on such a garment cannot be seen. One might ask: <b>Or is it only</b> to <b>exclude the garment of a blind person, </b> who is unable to see the ritual fringes? <b>When it states</b> in the verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), the obligation of ritual fringes for <b>the garment of a blind person is mentioned. </b> If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“That you may look upon it”? </b> It serves to <b>exclude a night garment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:12 | “On the four corners of your garment” | Zevachim 18b:7 | § <b>R' Yirmeya of Difti says: </b> The case of <b>dragging</b> vestments <b>that</b> the priest <b>did not raise is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“On the four corners of your garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), from which it can be inferred: <b>Four, but not three, </b> i.e., a three-cornered garment is exempt from the obligation of ritual fringes. One may ask: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> specifying <b>four, but not five? When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself, ”</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>is mentioned</b> as obligated. If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“Four</b> corners”? It means <b>four, but not three. And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>and to exclude</b> a garment <b>of three</b> corners? <b>I include</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>as four is included in five, and I exclude</b> a garment <b>of three</b> corners <b>as four is not included in three. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:13 | and go in unto her” | Ketubot 46a:19 | The Talmud resumes its quotation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it was <b>discovered that the bad name is not a bad name, </b> i.e., the husband’s accusation was false, <b>he is flogged and gives</b> her father <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>, whether he had sex with her</b> or <b>whether he had not had sex with her. R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: These matters were stated only</b> in a case <b>where he had sex</b> with his wife before defaming her. The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written: </b> “If a man take a wife <b>and go in unto her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13), and: <b>“And when I came near to her, </b> I did not find in her the tokens of virginity” (Deuteronomy 22:14), as both expressions refer to sex. |
| Deuteronomy 22:13 | did the Torah say: “When a man takes a woman” | Kiddushin 2b:13 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> Mishnah, which teaches <i>derekh</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13) <b>and did not write: “When a woman is taken by a man? Because it is the way [<i>derekh</i>] of a man to pursue a woman, and it is not the way of a woman to pursue a man. </b> The Talmud cites <b>a parable of a man who lost an item. Who searches for what? </b> Certainly <b>the owner of the lost item searches for his lost item, </b> not the other way around. Since woman was created from man’s lost side, the man seeks that which he has lost. To allude to this statement of R' Shimon, the Mishnah employs the term <i>derekh</i> in this context. |
| Deuteronomy 22:13 | takes | Kiddushin 9a:8 | <b>Rava said: There, </b> in the case of a sale, the formulation of the document is taken <b>from the context of the verse, and here, </b> in the case of betrothal, the formulation of the document is likewise taken <b>from the context of the verse. </b> Rava elaborates: <b>There, </b> with regard to a sale, <b>it is written: “And sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), which indicates that <b>God renders</b> the transaction <b>dependent on the seller. Here, it is written: “If</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 22:13), meaning that <b>God renders</b> the betrothal <b>dependent on the husband. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:13 | So too, | Kiddushin 9a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>There, </b> in the case of a sale, <b>it is also written: “Men shall buy [<i>yiknu</i>] fields for money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), which indicates that the matter depends upon the buyer. The Talmud answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse: Shall sell <b>[<i>yikkanu</i>]. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you read it</b> as <b><i>yikkanu</i>; because it is written</b> in the verse in Leviticus: <b>“And sells, ”</b> and there is a preference to have the verse from the Prophets accord with that of the Torah? <b>So too, </b> instead of: “If a man takes [<i>ki yikaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:13), <b>read into</b> the verse: When he is given <b>[<i>ki yakiaḥ</i>], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), so that the verses will accord with each other. |
| Deuteronomy 22:14 | “And he place wanton charges against her” | Ketubot 46a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> of <b>R' Yehuda? </b> Nowhere does the Torah explicitly state that the husband hired false witnesses. The Talmud answers that <b>R' Abbahu said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>placing, </b> written with regard to a defamer, and the term <b>placing, </b> written with regard to the prohibition against charging interest. <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to a defamer: <b>“And he place wanton charges against her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:14), <b>and it is written there: “Neither shall you place upon him interest”</b> (Exodus 22:24). <b>Just as below, </b> with regard to interest, the verse is referring to <b>money, so too here, </b> in the case of a defamer, it is referring to <b>money, </b> thereby indicating that the husband paid money in order to substantiate his false accusation. |

The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written: </b> “If a man take a wife <b>and go in unto her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13), and: <b>“And when I came near to her, </b> I did not find in her the tokens of virginity” (Deuteronomy 22:14), as both expressions refer to sex. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | as it is stated: “I gave my daughter to this man [ la’ish hazeh ] as a wife” | Ketubot 22a:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Asi said: From where in the Torah</b> is the principle: <b>The mouth that prohibited is the mouth that permitted, </b> derived? It is derived <b>as it is stated: “I gave my daughter to this man [<i>la’ish hazeh</i>] as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). When the father said that he married her off <b>“to the man [<i>la’ish</i>]”</b> without revealing his identity, <b>he rendered her forbidden</b> to all men. When he then says <b>“this [<i>hazeh</i>], ”</b> thereby identifying the man to whom he married her off, <b>he renders her permitted</b> to her husband. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | as it is stated: “I gave my daughter to the man [ la’ish ]” | Ketubot 22a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need to derive this from <b>the verse? It is</b> based on <b>logic: He rendered her forbidden and he rendered her permitted. Rather, where this verse is necessary, is</b> in order <b>to</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where in the Torah</b> is it derived that <b>a father is deemed credible to render his daughter forbidden? </b> It is derived <b>as it is stated: “I gave my daughter to the man [<i>la’ish</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the subsequent term <b>“this [<i>hazeh</i>]”? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | I gave my daughter to this man” | Ketubot 46a:16 | The Talmud comments: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as R' Yona taught</b> that the verse “And the father of the young woman shall say to the Elders: <b>I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16) serves to emphasize: I gave her <b>to this</b> man <b>and not to the <i>yavam</i>, </b> i.e., the brother of the original husband. Consequently, if one defames his <i>yevama</i> with regard to her original marriage to his brother, the unique <i>halakhot</i> of defamation do not apply. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man” | Ketubot 46b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the betrothal money should go <b>to her, </b> as one can derive from the verse that there is no money for this master but there is money for the woman herself when she leaves her father’s domain. The Talmud refutes this suggestion: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>her father accepts her betrothal, </b> i.e., he can accept the money or document of betrothal from the man of his choice, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). Can one then say that <b>she takes the money</b> when her father accepts the betrothal on her behalf? |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man” | Kiddushin 3b:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this money is given <b>to her? </b> The Talmud rejects this: <b>How can</b> one suggest <b>this? Her father receives her betrothal, </b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, when he marries her off to her husband, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), <b>and</b> shall <b>she take the money? </b> Since he is the one who marries her off, he is certainly entitled to the money of her betrothal. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | by Torah law? As it is stated: “I gave my daughter to this man [ la’ish hazzeh ]” | Kiddushin 64a:11 | <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says: </b> In <b>the first clause</b> of the Mishnah, the reason is that <b>God believes him, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a father is deemed credible to render his daughter forbidden</b> as a betrothed woman <b>by Torah law? As it is stated: “I gave my daughter to this man [<i>la’ish hazzeh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). When the father said that he married her <b>to “the man [<i>la’ish</i>], ” he rendered her forbidden</b> to all men. When he then said <b>“this [<i>hazzeh</i>], ” he rendered her permitted</b> to this specific man, her husband. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | [ ki yakiaḥ ], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man” | Kiddushin 9a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>There, </b> in the case of a sale, <b>it is also written: “Men shall buy [<i>yiknu</i>] fields for money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), which indicates that the matter depends upon the buyer. The Talmud answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse: Shall sell <b>[<i>yikkanu</i>]. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you read it</b> as <b><i>yikkanu</i>; because it is written</b> in the verse in Leviticus: <b>“And sells, ”</b> and there is a preference to have the verse from the Prophets accord with that of the Torah? <b>So too, </b> instead of: “If a man takes [<i>ki yikaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:13), <b>read into</b> the verse: When he is given <b>[<i>ki yakiaḥ</i>], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), so that the verses will accord with each other. |
| Deuteronomy 22:16 | I gave my daughter to this man | Sotah 23b:9 | The Mishnah states: <b>A man can betroth his daughter</b> to another man while she is a minor, <b>but a woman cannot betroth her daughter. </b> The Talmud explains: This is <b>as it is written: </b> “And the father of the maiden shall say to the elders: <b>I gave my daughter to this man</b> as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:16), indicating that it is only the father who has the power to betroth his daughter. The Mishnah states: <b>A man can sell his daughter</b> as a female slave <b>but a woman cannot sell her daughter. </b> The Talmud explains: This is derived <b>as it is written: “And if a man sells his daughter</b> to be a female slave” (Exodus 21:7), indicating that only a man can sell his daughter, while a woman cannot. |
| Deuteronomy 22:17 | Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written: “I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity” | Ketubot 46a:21 | The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written: “I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17), as R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov claims that the husband had sex with her and discovered that she was not a virgin. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> the meaning of <b>“I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity, ”</b> if they did not have sex? The Talmud answers: The Rabbis explain that he means: <b>I did not find for your daughter the fitness of virginity, </b> i.e., I have discovered that she was unfaithful. |
| Deuteronomy 22:17 | “And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity” | Ketubot 46a:22 | The Talmud asks further: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written</b> that the father replies: <b>“And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17). He presents a cloth that proves she was a virgin, in opposition to the husband’s claim. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> the meaning of <b>“And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”? </b> The Rabbis answer that the father means: <b>And these are the</b> proofs of the <b>fitness of my daughter’s virginity, </b> i.e., he either brings witnesses to counter the testimony of the husband’s witnesses or provides some other proof that his daughter was a virgin at the time of her marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 22:17 | Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is at it is written: “And they shall spread the garment” | Ketubot 46a:23 | The Talmud poses yet another question on the same lines: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is at it is written: “And they shall spread the garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17). The father brings the sheet on which the couple had sex and shows that it is stained with blood. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, </b> who claim that a husband can defame his wife even if they have not had sex, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“And they shall spread the garment [<i>hasimla</i>]”? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:18 | “chastise” | Sanhedrin 71b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>Where is it written</b> that <b>lashes</b> are administered <b>to a stubborn and rebellious son? </b> There is no explicit mention of lashes in the verse. The Talmud answers: It is <b>as R' Abbahu</b> said in another context, <b>as R' Abbahu says: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> as stated with regard to a defamer: “And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him” (Deuteronomy 22:18), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“chastise”</b> stated with regard to a rebellious son (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> in the latter verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“son”</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“son [<i>ben</i>]”</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the similar word <b>“<i>bin</i>”</b> stated with regard to lashes: <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserves [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). Consequently, the chastisement mentioned with regard to both a defamer and a rebellious son involves flogging. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | one hundred sela , | Arakhin 15a:5 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a defamer, </b> who falsely claims that his bride was not a virgin, <b>that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent. How so? Both</b> one <b>who defamed</b> a young woman who is the most <b>prominent in the priesthood and</b> one who defamed a young woman who is the <b>lowliest among the Israelites gives</b> payment of <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>, </b> the fine stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 22:19). |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | because he has defamed | Arakhin 15a:8 | <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the young woman, <b>because he has defamed</b> a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:19). This indicates that he is punished severely for his words, <b>for the defamation, </b> not because she might be put to death. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | as it is stated: “And they shall give them to the father of the young woman [ na’ara ]” | Ketubot 40b:12 | The Talmud relates: <b>Rav Pappa, son</b> of <b>Rav Ḥanan, from</b> a place called <b>Bei Keloḥit, heard</b> this <i>halakha</i> and <b>went and said it before Rav Shimi bar Ashi. </b> Rav Shimi <b>said to him: You teach this</b> statement <b>concerning that</b> matter. <b>We, </b> based on our traditions, <b>teach it concerning this</b> matter, as <b>Reish Lakish said: One who slanders a minor girl, </b> falsely claiming that she was not a virgin on the wedding night, <b>is exempt</b> from paying the fine, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall give them to the father of the young woman [<i>na’ara</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19). <b>The verse spoke of <i>na’ara</i>, </b> not only pronounced but written <b>in full, </b> indicating that this payment is in effect only with regard to a young woman, not a minor girl. However, in places where the term is written <i>na’ar</i>, even a minor girl would be included. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | and give them to the father of the young woman” | Ketubot 44b:4 | § <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The defamer of an orphan</b> girl <b>is exempt, as it is stated: </b> “And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, <b>and give them to the father of the young woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19), which <b>excludes this one who does not have a father. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | “a virgin of Israel” | Ketubot 44b:7 | <b>Rava said, </b> in contrast to R' Yosei bar Ḥanina, that one who defames an orphan is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fine. <b>From where</b> does he learn this? He learns this <b>from</b> the fact that <b>Ami taught</b> that the fine applies to one who defamed <b>“a virgin of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19) <b>and</b> does <b>not</b> apply to one who defamed <b>a virgin</b> who is <b>a convert. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | is exempt, as it is stated: “And give them to the father of the young woman [ na’ara ]” | Ketubot 44b:9 | § <b>Reish Lakish said: The defamer</b> of <b>a minor</b> girl <b>is exempt, as it is stated: “And give them to the father of the young woman [<i>na’ara</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19). The word <i>na’ara</i> is written in full, with the letter <i>heh</i> at the end, whereas elsewhere in the Torah it is written without the <i>heh</i>. This indicates that <b>the verse was speaking</b> of a female who has <b>fully</b> attained the status of <b>a young woman, </b> rather than a minor who has not yet reached the state of being a young woman. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | one hundred sela | Ketubot 45a:2 | The Talmud asks with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Is that to say that</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where her body has changed</b> after her sin, the manner in which she is put to <b>death changes</b> as well? The Talmud <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a betrothed young woman who</b> allegedly <b>committed adultery, and after she reached majority</b> she married and her husband <b>defamed her, </b> accusing her of having committed adultery during the period of betrothal, <b>he is not flogged and does not give</b> the <b>one hundred <i>sela</i></b> if she is proven innocent, as these punishments are limited to one who defames a young woman (Deuteronomy 22:19). However, if she is guilty, <b>she and her conspiring witnesses are brought early</b> in the morning <b>to the place of stoning. </b> This proves that although her body changed between the time of the sin and the time of her punishment, she is stoned nevertheless. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | by a defamer | Kiddushin 11b:7 | The Talmud asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Asi <b>teaching us? </b> We have already <b>learned</b> all of these <i>halakhot</i> explicitly (<i>Bekhorot</i> 49b): The payment of <b>five <i>sela</i> for</b> the redemption of a firstborn <b>son</b> (Numbers 18:16); the payment of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for a slave, </b> paid by the owner of the ox that killed the slave (Exodus 21:32); the <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a rapist and by a seducer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29); the <b>one hundred</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a defamer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19); <b>all of these are</b> paid <b>in the sacred shekel, </b> which is <b>one hundred dinars in Tyrian</b> coinage. All of the cases in which a defined amount is mentioned by the Torah have already been taught, and it is unclear what Rav Asi adds. |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | the Merciful One states: “And she shall be his wife” | Makkot 15a:4 | <b>Ulla says</b> in response: The positive mitzva in the case of a rapist is not a mitzva that precedes the prohibition. Rather, it follows the prohibition and rectifies it, as it is referring to a case of one who married his victim and then divorced her. <b>Let</b> the verse <b>not state: “And she shall be his wife, ” in</b> the case of <b>a rapist, and let us derive</b> it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>one who defames</b> his bride, claiming that she was not a virgin when he consummated the marriage: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a defamer, who did not perform an action</b> but sinned through speech, <b>God states: “And she shall be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19), then in the case of <b>a rapist, </b> who performed an action, <b>is it not all the more so</b> that he is obligated to take her as a wife? |
| Deuteronomy 22:19 | “And she shall be his wife” | Yevamot 59a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b> If <b>she had atypical sex, she is disqualified from</b> the High <b>Priesthood, </b> i.e., from marrying the High Priest. <b>Rava raised an objection</b> based upon a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to rape: <b>“And she shall be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19), and the rabbis explained that this is referring only <b>to a woman suitable for him, excluding a widow for a High Priest</b> and <b>a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i> for a common priest. </b> In these cases, the rapist is not permitted to marry his victim. |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | that she die” | Ketubot 44b:1 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> Since the rulings of the Mishnah are based on the principle that the special <i>halakhot</i> of a betrothed young woman who committed adultery apply only to a woman who was born Jewish, the Talmud questions the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who was conceived when her mother was a non-Jew but born when her mother was Jewish is executed via stoning: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: As the verse states: </b> “And the men of her city shall stone her with stones <b>that she die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21). The phrase “that she die” is superfluous and comes <b>to include</b> one <b>whose conception</b> occurred when her mother <b>was not</b> yet <b>in</b> a state of <b>sanctity but her birth</b> took place when her mother was <b>in</b> a state of <b>sanctity. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | the verse states: “That she die” | Ketubot 44b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>If so, </b> if the verse equates her to a regular Jewish woman, <b>let</b> her husband <b>also be flogged</b> if he defames her, <b>and let him also pay</b> the <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>. </b> The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “That she die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21), which indicates that <b>she was included with regard to</b> the <b>death</b> penalty <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>fine. </b> The Talmud asks another question: <b>Say</b> that this verse comes <b>to include</b> only a girl <b>whose conception and birth</b> both occurred when her mother was <b>in</b> a state of <b>sanctity. </b> The Talmud responds: <b>That</b> girl <b>is a full-fledged Jewish woman, </b> and there is no difference between her and any other Jewish woman. |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | “in Israel” | Ketubot 44b:3 | The Talmud asks a question from the opposite perspective: <b>And say</b> that the verse comes <b>to include</b> even one <b>whose conception and birth</b> both occurred when her mother was <b>not in</b> a state of <b>sanctity. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>If so, </b> the phrase <b>“in Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21), <b>what purpose does it</b> serve? This expression indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to a woman who was born Jewish. |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | “entrance” | Ketubot 45b:10 | <b>R' Abbahu said: </b> One <b>derives</b> this by verbal analogy, as follows: The meaning of the term <b>“entrance”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21), stated with regard to a betrothed woman who committed adultery, is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“entrance”</b> that appears with regard to the Tabernacle, in the verse “The entrance of the gate of the courtyard” (Numbers 4:26); <b>and</b> the meaning of this usage of the term <b>entrance</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“gate, ”</b> which appears in the same phrase; <b>and</b> the meaning of this usage of the term <b>“gate”</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“your gates”</b> stated with regard to idolatry. This teaches that a young woman who was betrothed and committed adultery is executed at the gate of the city, similar to one who engaged in idol worship. |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | “To play the whore in her father’s house” | Ketubot 48b:13 | § A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the father delivered</b> his daughter <b>to the husband’s messengers and she</b> subsequently <b>committed adultery, she is</b> sentenced <b>to strangulation, </b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a married woman who committed adultery, rather than stoning, which is the punishment for a betrothed woman who commits adultery. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>R' Ami bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>the verse states, </b> in the context of the command to stone a young woman who commits adultery during betrothal: <b>“To play the whore in her father’s house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21), which <b>excludes</b> a case <b>when the father has delivered</b> her <b>to the husband’s messengers, </b> when she is no longer in her father’s house. |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | it is written: “Because she has committed a wanton deed in Israel, | Sanhedrin 44a:6 | With regard to Achan, the verse states: <b>“And because he has committed a wanton deed in Israel”</b> (Joshua 7:15). <b>R' Abba bar Zavda says: </b> This <b>teaches that</b> Achan <b>had sex with a betrothed young woman. </b> This offense is also alluded to by the wording of the verse. <b>Here, </b> with regard to Achan, <b>it is written: “And because he has committed a wanton deed, ” and there, </b> with regard to a betrothed young woman who committed adultery, <b>it is written: “Because she has committed a wanton deed in Israel, </b> to play the harlot in her father’s house” (Deuteronomy 22:21). |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | “her father” is stated with regard to stoning, | Sanhedrin 50a:10 | The Talmud answers: The severity of burning is derived by means of a verbal analogy. The term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to stoning, </b> in the verse: “And the men of her city shall stone her with stones and she shall die, because she has done a depraved thing in Israel, to play the harlot in the house of her father” (Deuteronomy 22:21), <b>and</b> the term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to burning, </b> in the verse: “And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). Therefore, <b>just as</b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to stoning</b> it is established that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, so too, </b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to burning, </b> it may be established that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | her father” | Sanhedrin 50b:19 | One <b>might</b> have thought <b>even</b> if she is <b>unmarried</b> and she engaged in promiscuous sex she should be executed by burning. This is incorrect, as <b>here it is stated: “Her father, ” and there it is stated</b> with regard to a betrothed woman who committed adultery: “Because she has done a depraved thing in Israel, to play the harlot in the house of <b>her father”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21). <b>Just as there, </b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous sex</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband, so too here, </b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous sex</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:21 | “Her father” | Sanhedrin 51b:14 | <b>R' Akiva says: Both the betrothed and the married</b> daughter of a priest <b>are singled out for</b> execution by <b>burning. </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even an unmarried</b> daughter of a priest who engaged in promiscuous sex should be executed by burning. This is incorrect, as <b>here it is stated: “Her father, ” and there it is stated, </b> with regard to a betrothed woman who committed adultery: <b>“Her father”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21). It is derived through a verbal analogy that <b>just as below, </b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous sex</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband, so too here, </b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous sex</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | they shall also both of them die, | Arakhin 7a:13 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>indeed</b> the court should delay her execution until she gives birth? <b>R' Abbahu says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> The <b>verse states: </b> “If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then <b>they shall also both of them die, </b> the man that lay with the woman, and the woman” (Deuteronomy 22:22). The amplifying term “both of them” serves <b>to add</b> her <b>fetus, </b> teaching that it dies together with her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | “Then they shall both of them die” | Kiddushin 10a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term <b>“only”? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“Then they shall both of them die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22). This indicates that this is not the case <b>unless</b> the two of them <b>are equal, </b> i.e., both deserve punishment. But if one of them cannot be punished, e.g., if he is a minor, the other is not executed either. This is <b>the statement of R' Oshaya. R' Yonatan says</b> that the verse: <b>“Then the man only who lay with her shall die, ”</b> indicates that in some cases only one of them is liable to receive the death penalty. |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | And Rabbi Yoḥanan, | Kiddushin 9b:14 | The Talmud returns to the different derivations of R' Yehuda HaNasi and R' Yoḥanan. <b>And R' Yoḥanan, </b> who maintains that the mode of betrothal through sex is derived from the verse: “If a man be found lying with a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:22), what does he <b>do with this</b> verse: “When a man takes a woman <b>and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? The Talmud answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse for a different <i>halakha</i>, as he maintains that it teaches that <b>this</b> woman <b>can be acquired through sex, but a Hebrew female slave cannot be acquired through sex. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | a married woman [ beulat ba’al ]” | Kiddushin 9b:20 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: “If a man be found lying with <b>a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22), from which R' Yoḥanan derives that sex is a valid means of betrothal? The Talmud answers: R' Yehuda HaNasi <b>requires this</b> verse for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the husband renders her a non-virgin</b> even if he engages <b>in sex</b> with her <b>in an atypical manner, but no other</b> man <b>renders her a non-virgin</b> by engaging <b>in sex</b> with her <b>in an atypical manner. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | a married woman [ beulat ba’al ]” | Kiddushin 9b:7 | § The Mishnah teaches that a woman can be betrothed <b>through sex. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “If a man be found lying with <b>a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22). This <b>teaches that he becomes her husband [<i>ba’al</i>] by means of sex [<i>be’ila</i>]. R' Zeira said to R' Abbahu, and some say</b> it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said this <b>to R' Yoḥanan: </b> Is <b>this</b> other proof, <b>taught by R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>unacceptable: </b> “When a man takes a woman <b>and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>she can be acquired through sex. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | “Then they shall both die” | Sanhedrin 66b:10 | The Talmud answers that this matter is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, </b> as is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Then they shall both die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> does not apply <b>unless they are both equally</b> subject to punishment. If one of them cannot be punished, e.g., because he or she is a minor, the other is not executed either. This is <b>the statement of R' Yoshiya. R' Yonatan says</b> that the phrase from the verse <b>“then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> indicates that in some cases only one of them is liable to receive the death penalty. |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | then they shall both die, | Sanhedrin 66b:8 | R' Ya’akov bar Adda raised an objection to this answer: <b>But isn’t it written: </b> “If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, <b>then they shall both die, </b> the man who lies with the woman, and the woman” (Deuteronomy 22:22), indicating that this punishment does not apply <b>unless they are both equally</b> subject to punishment? If so, one who has sex with a betrothed minor girl is exempt, as she is not halakhically competent. <b>Rav remained silent</b> and did not answer him. |
| Deuteronomy 22:22 | “If a man shall be found lying with a woman married to a husband, | Sanhedrin 86a:6 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If that is so, </b> then the verse: <b>“If a man shall be found lying with a woman married to a husband, </b> then they shall both of them die” (Deuteronomy 22:22), may <b>also</b> be interpreted: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall be found, ”</b> to <b>exclude</b> one who was already <b>found. So too, </b> would one say <b>that</b> adulterers <b>are exempt</b> from liability if they commit adultery in, <b>for example, the house of so-and-so, where</b> married women <b>are commonly</b> found and they have a preexisting reputation for licentiousness? |
| Deuteronomy 22:23 | “If there is a young woman who is a virgin betrothed to a man” | Ketubot 48b:15 | In answer to this question, <b>Rava said: </b> The verse cannot be excluding that case, as <b>Ami said to me</b> that the case where she already entered the <b>wedding canopy is</b> not derived by inference from that verse; it is <b>explicitly written</b> in the following verse: <b>“If there is a young woman who is a virgin betrothed to a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:23). The terminology of the verse indicates that it applies to a <b>“young woman” and not</b> to <b>a grown woman; </b> to a <b>“virgin” and not</b> to <b>a non-virgin; </b> and to a <b>“betrothed”</b> woman <b>and not</b> to <b>a married woman. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:24 | “For the matter [ devar ] that he has humbled | Sanhedrin 41a:4 | <b>The school of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> a source for the requirement to forewarn a transgressor from the verse concerning the court-imposed capital punishment meted out to one who commits adultery with a betrothed young woman, as it is stated: <b>“For the matter [<i>devar</i>] that he has humbled</b> his neighbor’s wife” (Deuteronomy 22:24). They make a verbal analogy: <b>For matters</b> involving <b>speech [<i>dibbur</i>], </b> the punishment is given only if the witnesses issued a verbal forewarning. |
| Deuteronomy 22:24 | and “affliction” is stated later, | Yoma 81a:21 | <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught</b> an alternative verbal analogy for the derivation: <b>“Affliction” is stated here, </b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>and “affliction” is stated later, </b> with regard to a man who rapes a woman: “Because he has afflicted his neighbor’s wife” (Deuteronomy 22:24). <b>Just as there, </b> in the case of rape, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning, so too here, </b> in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> a different proof: <b>Derive</b> a verbal analogy from the words <b>“Shabbat of solemn rest”</b> (Leviticus 16:31) written with regard to Yom Kippur <b>from</b> the words “Shabbat of solemn rest” (Exodus 31:15, 32:5; Leviticus 23:3) written with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates the <b>Shabbat of Creation. Just as there, </b> in the case of Shabbat, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning, so too here, </b> in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <b>did not punish unless there was</b> prior <b>warning. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:25 | as the verse states: “Then the man only who lay with her shall die” | Kiddushin 10a:1 | <b>R' Zeira said: R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes with regard to</b> the <b>fine</b> of a rapist and a seducer <b>that they all pay</b> this fine, and they are not exempt merely because their acts of sex were with a non-virgin. The Talmud asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the <b>death</b> penalty? With respect to the death penalty they are punished as though they had sex with a betrothed non-virgin, and yet concerning the fine, they pay as though they had sex with a virgin. The Talmud answers: It <b>is different there, </b> with regard to capital punishment, <b>as the verse states: “Then the man only who lay with her shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25), which indicates that only one man is executed for having sex with a virgin, and no more. |
| Deuteronomy 22:25 | first [ teḥila ]; and likewise it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die” | Sanhedrin 66b:14 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes [<i>teḥel</i>] herself by playing the harlot, </b> she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The word <i>teḥel</i> means <b>first [<i>teḥila</i>]; and likewise it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25). |
| Deuteronomy 22:25 | then the man who lay with her alone shall die” | Sanhedrin 66b:9 | <b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav remained silent? Why not say to</b> R' Ya’akov that his premise is repudiated by the verse: “But if the man finds the betrothed young woman in the field, and the man takes hold of her, and lies with her, <b>then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25)? This verse proves that the punishment of stoning applies to the man even if the woman is exempt. The <i>halakha</i> of a man who has sex with a betrothed minor should be the same. |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | “But to the maiden you shall do nothing, | Avodah Zarah54a:3 | <b>Rami bar Ḥama says: No, </b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where non-Jews coerced</b> someone <b>and he bowed to his own animal. R' Zeira objects to this: God exempts</b> a victim of <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> from punishment, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a betrothed young woman who is raped: <b>“But to the maiden you shall do nothing, </b> the maiden has no sin worthy of death, for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, so is this matter” (Deuteronomy 22:26). |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | “But to the young woman you shall do nothing” | Bava Kamma28b:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why</b> is this so? Isn’t he the <b>victim of circumstances beyond his control? And God exempts</b> a victim of <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> from punishment, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a betrothed young woman who is raped: <b>“But to the young woman you shall do nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:26). |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | “But unto the damsel you shall do nothing; | Nedarim 27a:7 | <b>Rava said to him: He is a victim of circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>God exempted a victim of circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control</b> from responsibility for his actions, <b>as it is written</b> concerning a young woman who was raped: <b>“But unto the damsel you shall do nothing; </b> there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death” (Deuteronomy 22:26). |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, so too with this matter” | Pesachim 25b:2 | That one may not heal oneself with <b>idolatry</b> even when his life is in danger is learned <b>from that</b> which <b>we</b> just <b>said, </b> based on the verse: “With all your soul and with all your might. ” From where is this <i>halakha</i> derived with regard to <b>forbidden sexual sex and murder? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> The verse says about one who rapes a betrothed woman: “But you shall do nothing to the young woman; the young woman has committed no sin worthy of death; <b>for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, so too with this matter”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:26). <b>What does a murderer have to do with a betrothed young woman</b> who was raped? Why would the verse mention murder in this context? |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | The verse states: “But you shall do nothing to the young woman [ na’ara ]; the young woman has committed no sin worthy of death” | Sanhedrin 73a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “But you shall do nothing to the young woman [<i>na’ara</i>]; the young woman has committed no sin worthy of death”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:26). The word is read as young woman, “<i>na’ara</i>,” but it is written as young man, <i>na’ar</i>. <b><i>Na’ar</i>, </b> as it is written, <b>this is</b> an allusion to <b>sodomy. “<i>Na’ara</i>, ”</b> as it is read, <b>this is a betrothed young woman. “Sin”; these are</b> women who are forbidden to him by a prohibition the violation of which renders him <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>. “Death”; these are</b> women who are forbidden to him by a prohibition the violation of which renders him <b>liable to</b> receive <b>a court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalty. |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, | Sanhedrin 73a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>But does</b> the court <b>administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? </b> The Talmud answers: A Sage <b>of the school of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught: </b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> also derived from an analogy based on <b>a juxtaposition. </b> How so? With regard to the rape of a betrothed young woman it is written: “But you shall do nothing to the young woman; the young woman has committed no sin worthy of death; <b>for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, </b> so too with this matter” (Deuteronomy 22:26). But why would the verse mention murder in this context? <b>But what do we learn</b> here <b>from a murderer? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, | Sanhedrin 74a:17 | From where is it derived that one must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress the prohibition of <b>forbidden sexual sex and</b> the prohibition of <b>bloodshed? </b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> With regard to the rape of a betrothed young woman it is written: “But you shall do nothing to the young woman; the young woman has committed no sin worthy of death; <b>for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, </b> so too with this matter” (Deuteronomy 22:26). But why would the verse mention murder in this context? <b>But what do we learn</b> here <b>from a murderer? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:26 | “For as when a man rises against his fellow and slays him, even so is this matter” | Yoma 82a:12 | § With regard to the concept that one must surrender his life rather than have <b>forbidden sexual sex or shed blood</b> through murder, <b>from where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: </b> It is stated about the rape of a betrothed woman: <b>“For as when a man rises against his fellow and slays him, even so is this matter”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:26). One might ask: <b>What idea did we learn about a betrothed woman from a murderer? </b> The <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed woman is clear; what new point is learned by comparing it to the <i>halakha</i> of a murderer? |
| Deuteronomy 22:27 | “For he found her in a field” | Bava Batra16b:14 | The Talmud cites proofs to support these charges. <b>He had sex with a betrothed maiden, </b> as <b>it is written here: “And Esau came in from the field”; and it is written there</b> with regard to rape of a betrothed maiden: <b>“For he found her in a field”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:27). <b>He killed a person, </b> as <b>it is written here: </b> “And he was <b>faint”; and it is written there: “Woe is me, for my soul faints before the slayers”</b> (Jeremiah 4:31). <b>And he denied the principle</b> of God’s existence, as <b>it is written here: “What profit is this to me”</b> (Genesis 25:32); <b>and it is written there: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). When he questioned the profit of “this,” he was challenging the assertion that “this is my God. ” <b>And he denied resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “Behold, I am at the point of death”</b> (Genesis 25:32), indicating that he did not believe in resurrection after death. <b>And he despised the birthright, as it is written: “And Esau despised the birthright”</b> (Genesis 25:34). |
| Deuteronomy 22:27 | and there was none to save her” | Sanhedrin 73a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>betrothed young woman herself, from where do we</b> derive that she may be saved at the cost of the rapist’s life? The Talmud explains: <b>As it was taught in the school of R' Yishmael: </b> The verse states: “For he found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman cried out, <b>and there was none to save her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:27). <b>But if there was someone to save her, </b> he must do so <b>by any means that can save</b> her, even by killing the potential rapist. |
| Deuteronomy 22:28 | Reish Lakish said | Ketubot 29b:2 | § The Talmud questions the basic <i>halakha</i> that one who rapes young women of flawed lineage is liable to pay the fine: <b>And are these</b> young women <b>entitled</b> to the <b>fine? But why? I read here</b> with regard to a rapist: <b>“And to him she shall be as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which the rabbis derived that only <b>a wife who is suitable for him</b> is eligible to receive payment of a fine from a rapist. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that one verse states: “If a man finds a young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:28), and another states: “And he shall give to the father of the young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This is tantamount to three mentions: <b>Young woman, young woman, the young woman, </b> as the superfluous definite article is interpreted as a 3rd mention of the term. <b>One</b> mention is required <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself, </b> that one who rapes a young woman is liable to pay a fine; <b>and one</b> is <b>to include</b> payment of a fine to those young women for whose rape one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions; and one</b> is <b>to include</b> payment of a fine to those young women for whose rape one is <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:28 | who was not betrothed” | Ketubot 38a:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>R' Yosei HaGelili? </b> It is as <b>the verse states: </b> “If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin <b>who was not betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:28), from which it may be inferred: If <b>she was betrothed she does not have</b> a <b>fine</b> for rape. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>R' Akiva</b> explain this verse? The Talmud answers that the verse states: If it is a young woman <b>who was not betrothed, </b> the fine is paid <b>to her father, </b> from which it may be inferred: If <b>she was betrothed, </b> the fine is paid <b>to</b> the betrothed woman <b>herself. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:28 | “Who was not betrothed” | Ketubot 38a:9 | The Talmud answers: <b>R' Akiva</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Who was not betrothed, ” is required by him</b> to teach another <i>halakha</i> <b>that is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>. <b>“Who was not betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:28) comes to <b>exclude a young woman who was betrothed and divorced</b> and establish <b>that she does not</b> receive payment of a <b>fine</b> for her rape; this is <b>the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili. R' Akiva says: She</b> receives payment of a <b>fine</b> for her rape, <b>and her fine</b> goes <b>to her father, </b> contrary to the ruling attributed to R' Akiva in the Mishnah. <b>And</b> ostensibly, no verse is required to derive this <i>halakha</i>, as <b>logic dictates</b> that it is so: <b>Since her father is entitled to the money of her betrothal</b> if she is betrothed before she becomes a grown woman, <b>and</b> likewise <b>her father is entitled to the money of her fine; just as the money of her</b> subsequent <b>betrothal</b> as a young woman, <b>even though she was betrothed and divorced, </b> is paid <b>to her father, so too, the money of her fine, although she was betrothed and divorced, </b> is paid <b>to her father. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:28 | said to him: Is it written: And he shall give to the father of the young woman who is not betrothed? | Ketubot 39a:5 | On a similar note, <b>Rava inquired of Abaye: </b> If he forcibly <b>had sex with</b> a young woman <b>and she was</b> later <b>betrothed, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Abaye <b>said to him: Is it written: And he shall give to the father of the young woman who is not betrothed? </b> Actually it is written: “If a man finds a young woman…who was not betrothed” (Deuteronomy 22:28), which indicates that the determining factor is whether she was betrothed before the rape and not whether she is engaged at the moment of payment. Rava asked him: <b>And according to your reasoning, that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If he forcibly <b>had sex</b> with a young woman <b>and she</b> later <b>married, </b> the fine is paid <b>to her, </b> not to her father. There too, ask: <b>Is it written: And he shall give to the father of the young woman who is not married? </b> Even though the verse does not address the moment of payment, if she married the fine is paid to her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | the Merciful One states | Arakhin 14b:23 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>Why</b> must the rapist or seducer also pay for her humiliation and degradation? One can <b>say</b> that <b>God states</b> in the verse: “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver” (Deuteronomy 22:29), that he is to pay a total of <b>fifty <i>sela</i> for all matters</b> associated with this act, i.e., the fine, degradation, humiliation, and pain. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | because he tormented her; | Arakhin 15a:3 | <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the reason the payment of fifty <i>sela</i> does not cover all forms of damage is that <b>the verse states: </b> “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels, and she shall be his wife, <b>because he tormented her; </b> he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This means that the payment is only for the torment, i.e., the rape. It <b>may be inferred that there are</b> additional payments for <b>humiliation and degradation, </b> beyond payment of the fine. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | that the verse states: “Then the man that lay with her | Arakhin 15a:4 | <b>Rava says</b> a different answer, <b>that the verse states: “Then the man that lay with her</b> shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Rava infers from here that payment for the <b>pleasure of lying</b> with the woman is <b>fifty</b> shekel. It <b>may be inferred</b> from here <b>that there are</b> other <b>matters</b> that must be paid by the rapist. <b>And what are they? </b> Compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | for he has afflicted her; | Bava Kamma84a:18 | <b>Rather, Rav Ashi</b> retracted his original statement and <b>said</b> a different derivation: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the word “for” as written with regard to injuries from the word “for” as written with regard to a man who rapes a woman, who must pay monetary compensation. The verse states: “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, <b>for he has afflicted her; </b> he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Based on this verbal analogy, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a person</b> is derived <b>from</b> a verse concerning <b>a person, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>damages</b> is derived <b>from</b> a verse concerning <b>damages. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | money stated in the Torah, | Bekhorot 50b:8 | The Talmud suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, if</b> this <b>was stated, </b> it <b>was stated like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: Every set</b> amount of <b>money stated in the Torah, </b> i.e., when a specific amount is mentioned, such as the fifty shekels paid by a rapist (Deuteronomy 22:29), is referring to <b>Tyrian coinage, and</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is in <b>provincial coinage. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “And the man who lay with her must give | Berakhot 21b:14 | <b>And from where</b> do we know <b>that</b> the verse <b>is written with regard to a woman raped by his father? As</b> the previous section, <b>juxtaposed to it, </b> deals with the laws of rape: <b>“And the man who lay with her must give</b> her father fifty shekels…because he has violated her” (Deuteronomy 22:29). |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | with regard to a rapist: “He may not send her away all his days” | Gittin 90a:13 | Rava <b>said to him</b> that the answer can be derived <b>from what God reveals</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to a rapist: “He may not send her away all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), indicating that even if he divorces the woman whom he raped and was subsequently commanded to marry, <b>all his days he stands</b> commanded <b>to arise and remarry</b> her as his wife. Evidently, <b>specifically there</b> the husband is obligated to remarry his divorcée, <b>as God reveals</b> as much. <b>But here, what he did, he did. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “And to him she shall be as a wife” | Ketubot 29b:2 | § The Talmud questions the basic <i>halakha</i> that one who rapes young women of flawed lineage is liable to pay the fine: <b>And are these</b> young women <b>entitled</b> to the <b>fine? But why? I read here</b> with regard to a rapist: <b>“And to him she shall be as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which the rabbis derived that only <b>a wife who is suitable for him</b> is eligible to receive payment of a fine from a rapist. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that one verse states: “If a man finds a young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:28), and another states: “And he shall give to the father of the young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This is tantamount to three mentions: <b>Young woman, young woman, the young woman, </b> as the superfluous definite article is interpreted as a 3rd mention of the term. <b>One</b> mention is required <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself, </b> that one who rapes a young woman is liable to pay a fine; <b>and one</b> is <b>to include</b> payment of a fine to those young women for whose rape one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions; and one</b> is <b>to include</b> payment of a fine to those young women for whose rape one is <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | as it is stated: “And he shall give to the father of the young woman” | Ketubot 29b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And Rav Pappa, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not cite</b> the source <b>as Reish Lakish</b> did? The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> derivation from the three instances of the term young woman is <b>required by him to</b> teach <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Abaye</b> said, <b>as Abaye said: </b> If one <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>sex with</b> a young woman <b>and she died</b> before he stood trial, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall give to the father of the young woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). From the fact that the verse does not simply say: To her father, it is inferred: <b>To the father of the young woman and not to the father of a dead</b> woman. He is liable only if the young woman is still alive. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “And to him she shall be [ tihye ] as a wife” | Ketubot 29b:7 | § The Talmud comments: <b>And</b> the Mishnah comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And to him she shall be [<i>tihye</i>] as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>Shimon HaTimni says: </b> This is referring to <b>a woman for whom there is betrothal [<i>havaya</i>]. </b> If one betroths a woman with whom sex are punishable by <i>karet</i>, the betrothal does not take effect. <b>R' Shimon ben Menasya says: </b> This is referring to <b>a woman who is suitable for</b> him to <b>sustain, </b> whom he need not divorce due to her flawed lineage. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | because [ taḥat ] he tormented her” | Ketubot 32b:1 | <b>Rather, Ulla derives</b> the fact that one pays and is not flogged by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>for</b> and <b>for. </b> The verse <b>states</b> with regard to rape: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and to him she shall be as a wife, <b>because [<i>taḥat</i>] he tormented her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>and it states there, </b> with regard to injury: <b>“An eye for [<i>taḥat</i>] an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to injury, one <b>pays money</b> and <b>is not flogged, </b> so too, in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes, </b> one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “Because he tormented her” | Ketubot 33a:2 | The Talmud raises a difficulty: If so, with regard to <b>one’s sister as well, </b> the lashes <b>can be fulfilled</b> in the case of one who had forced sex <b>with his sister</b> who is <b>a grown woman. </b> Since there is no fine in that case, he is flogged and the verse is not moot. The Talmud answers: <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that he does not agree with Ulla because <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Because he tormented her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), is not available for a verbal analogy, as <b>he requires it to</b> derive <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Abaye</b> said, <b>as Abaye said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> The fine of fifty dinar is payment <b>“because he tormented her”; by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> beyond the fine, <b>there is</b> compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | the verse states: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver” | Ketubot 33a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And Ulla, </b> who uses this verse to derive a verbal analogy, from where does he derive the <i>halakha</i> stated by Abaye? The Talmud answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the statement of <b>Rava, </b> who derives that <i>halakha</i> from the same verse, <b>as Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). The superfluous phrase “who lay with her” teaches that it is for <b>the pleasure of lying</b> with her that he pays <b>fifty</b> shekels, i.e., fifty <i>sela</i>; <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> beyond the fine, <b>there is</b> compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | fifty | Ketubot 38a:10 | <b>If so, </b> and the <i>halakha</i> can be logically inferred, <b>why does the verse state: “Who was not betrothed”? </b> This verse is <b>free, </b> as it is superfluous in its own context, <b>and</b> it is written <b>to liken</b> another case to it, <b>and to derive from it a verbal analogy: It is stated here</b> with regard to a woman who was raped: <b>“Who was not betrothed, ” and it is stated below: </b> “And if a man seduce a virgin <b>who was not betrothed”</b> (Exodus 22:15). <b>Just as here, </b> with regard to rape, the Torah specifies that the payment is <b>fifty</b> silver pieces (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>so too below, </b> with regard to seduction, the payment is <b>fifty. And just as below, </b> with regard to seduction, the payment is in <b>shekels, </b> as it is written: “He shall weigh [<i>yishkol</i>] money” (Exodus 22:16), <b>so too here, </b> the payment is in <b>shekels. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | shall give to the father of the young woman” | Ketubot 38b:9 | § <b>Abaye said: </b> If <b>one had sex with</b> a young woman, <b>and she died</b> before he was sentenced, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine, <b>as it is stated: “And</b> the man who lay with her <b>shall give to the father of the young woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which it is inferred, <b>and not to the father of a dead</b> girl. The Talmud comments: This <b>matter that</b> was <b>obvious to Abaye</b> was <b>raised as a dilemma to Rava. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | to her, | Ketubot 39a:6 | Abaye retorted: <b>How can</b> these cases be <b>compared? There, </b> in the case of marriage, there is reason to diverge from the plain meaning of the verse, <b>as grown-woman status removes her from</b> the <b>authority of the father and marriage removes her from</b> the <b>authority of the father. Just as</b> with regard to <b>grown-woman status, </b> if he forcibly <b>had sex with her and she became a grown woman, </b> the fine is paid <b>to her, </b> as it is written: “And he shall give to the father of the young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:29); <b>so too, </b> with regard to <b>marriage, </b> if he forcibly <b>had sex with her and she</b> later <b>married, </b> the fine is paid <b>to her. However, </b> with regard to <b>betrothal, does</b> it <b>remove</b> her <b>from</b> the <b>authority of the father entirely? Didn’t we learn</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Nedarim</i> 66b): With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows? </b> Apparently, betrothal does not remove her entirely from her father’s authority, and therefore, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to betrothal cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to grown-woman status. Therefore, Rava’s question is not difficult. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | as it is stated: “And to him she shall be as a wife” | Ketubot 39a:8 | The Mishnah clarifies: <b>How does</b> the rapist <b>drink from his vessel? Even if</b> the woman he raped <b>is lame, even if she is blind, and even if she is afflicted with boils, </b> he is obligated to marry her and may not divorce her. However, if <b>a matter of licentiousness is found in her, </b> e.g., if she committed adultery, <b>or if she is unfit to enter the Jewish people, </b> e.g., if she is a <i>mamzeret</i>, <b>he is not permitted to sustain her</b> as his wife, <b>as it is stated: “And to him she shall be as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which it is inferred that she must be <b>a woman who is</b> legally <b>suitable for him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | it is written: “And to him she shall be | Ketubot 39b:6 | <b>However, </b> from where is it derived that they can prevent the marriage in the case of <b>a rapist? Granted, she</b> herself can prevent the marriage, as <b>it is written: “And to him she shall be</b> as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29), and the term “shall be” indicates <b>with her consent. However, from where do we</b> derive that <b>her father</b> can prevent the marriage? |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | positive | Ketubot 40a:2 | § The Mishnah continues: <b>How does</b> the rapist <b>drink from his vessel? </b> The Mishnah proceeds to explain that he is obligated to marry her despite the physical flaws she might have. However, if the marriage is prohibited, either due to the fact that she committed adultery or due to her flawed lineage, he is not obligated to marry her, and therefore he may not marry her. <b>Rav Kahana said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Zevid of Neharde’a, </b> and I asked him: Let the <b>positive</b> mitzva: “And to him she shall be as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>come and override</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of marriage to a woman who is forbidden to him, according to the principle that positive mitzvot override prohibitions. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | and to him she shall be as a wife” | Ketubot 40b:11 | The Talmud questions the statement of the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to a girl more than three years of age: <b>A fine, yes, but sale, no? </b> Do the Rabbis maintain that a father cannot sell his minor daughter as a Hebrew female slave? Rather, emend the text and <b>say: </b> She <b>is even entitled to a fine where</b> she is subject to <b>sale. Rav Ḥisda said: What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Meir? </b> It is as <b>the verse says</b> with regard to a rapist: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty <i>sela</i>, <b>and to him she shall be as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>The verse is speaking with regard to one</b> halakhically competent to <b>marry</b> by <b>herself, </b> which means she must be a young woman. The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> what is the rationale for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse says “young woman [<i>na’ara</i>]”; </b> however, although the term is pronounced <i>na’ara</i>, it is written as <i>na’ar</i>, without the letter <i>heh</i>, and <b>even a minor girl is indicated</b> by that term. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | because he tormented her” | Ketubot 40b:3 | <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> a different proof. <b>The verse says: </b> “Fifty shekels of silver…<b>because he tormented her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29); <b>these</b> fifty <i>sela</i> are the fine paid <b>because he tormented her. </b> From which it <b>may be inferred that there are</b> the additional payments of <b>humiliation and degradation</b> beyond that sum mentioned in the verse. <b>Rava said</b> an alternative proof. <b>The verse says: “And the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). For <b>the pleasure of lying</b> with her he pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>; from which it <b>may be inferred that there are</b> the additional payments of <b>humiliation and degradation, </b> beyond payment of the fine. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | it is different, as the verse states: “And the man who laid with her shall give the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver” | Ketubot 42b:9 | <b>Rava said: This matter was difficult for Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> for <b>twenty-two years without resolution, until Rav Yosef sat at the head</b> of the academy <b>and resolved it</b> in the following manner: <b>There, </b> in the case of a rape, <b>it is different, as the verse states: “And the man who laid with her shall give the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which it is inferred: <b>The Torah entitled the father</b> to this money <b>only from the time of giving. </b> Consequently, if the father dies before receiving the money, he does not bequeath his right to the money to his sons. Instead, the daughter is considered to take her father’s place as the plaintiff, because she was the victim, and the money is paid to her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | fine | Ketubot 46b:8 | <b>And if you would say: Let us derive from here</b> that just as she is under her father’s authority with regard to vows, the same applies to monetary matters, this is not possible, because there is a principle that <b>we do not derive monetary matters from ritual matters, </b> as these are two separate areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <b>fine</b> paid by the rapist of a young woman, which the Torah explicitly states goes to her father (Deuteronomy 22:29), there is another principle, that <b>we do not derive monetary matters from fines. </b> Each fine imposed by the Torah is a novel law, from which nothing can be learned with regard to other monetary liabilities. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | he cannot divorce her | Ketubot 54a:5 | The Talmud elaborates: It may be argued that <b>since</b> the mother <b>does not have a marriage contract, </b> the daughter <b>does not have</b> the right to receive <b>sustenance</b> from her father’s estate. <b>Or perhaps</b> one should consider the following: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the marriage contract</b> was enacted? <b>So that</b> his wife <b>will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her. And this one, </b> his rape victim, <b>he cannot divorce her</b> by Torah law, as it is stated: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). It was therefore unnecessary for the rabbis to require that he provide the woman with a marriage contract. However, the reasons for the stipulations included in a marriage contract, e.g., that his daughter receives sustenance from his estate, still apply in this case. Consequently, the rabbis stipulated that these provisions still be granted. Yet again the Talmud states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | by a rapist and by a seducer | Kiddushin 11b:7 | The Talmud asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Asi <b>teaching us? </b> We have already <b>learned</b> all of these <i>halakhot</i> explicitly (<i>Bekhorot</i> 49b): The payment of <b>five <i>sela</i> for</b> the redemption of a firstborn <b>son</b> (Numbers 18:16); the payment of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for a slave, </b> paid by the owner of the ox that killed the slave (Exodus 21:32); the <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a rapist and by a seducer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29); the <b>one hundred</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a defamer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19); <b>all of these are</b> paid <b>in the sacred shekel, </b> which is <b>one hundred dinars in Tyrian</b> coinage. All of the cases in which a defined amount is mentioned by the Torah have already been taught, and it is unclear what Rav Asi adds. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | Rather, Rava says: | Makkot 15a:12 | <b>Rather, Rava says: </b> From where is it derived that a rapist must remarry his victim if he divorced her because the positive mitzva rectifies the prohibition “He may not send her away”? It is derived from the superfluous phrase: “All his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29), indicating that <b>all his days, </b> even after he marries and divorces her, he is obligated <b>to arise and remarry</b> her and is consequently not liable to receive lashes. The Talmud adds: <b>And likewise, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: All his days</b> he is obligated <b>to arise and remarry</b> her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | and he is not flogged | Makkot 15a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>Rather, what is the reason he retracted</b> his statement and claimed he did not say it? The Talmud answers: It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who <b>rapes</b> a virgin young woman, who is required by Torah law to marry her and for whom it is prohibited to divorce her as long as he lives, <b>is difficult for him, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a rapist who divorced</b> the woman he raped, <b>if he is a non-priest, he remarries</b> her, <b>and he is not flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>If he is a priest, </b> he is <b>flogged</b> for violating the prohibition, <b>and he does not remarry</b> her because it is prohibited for him to marry a divorcée. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | preceded it, | Makkot 15a:3 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>If he is a non-priest, he remarries</b> her, <b>and he is not flogged. Why? It is a prohibition that</b> has <b>a positive mitzva</b> which <b>preceded it, </b> as the positive mitzva: “And she shall be his wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29), precedes the prohibition “He may not send her away. ” <b>But let him be flogged, </b> since he violated the prohibition by divorcing her. Apparently, one is not flogged even if the positive mitzva precedes the prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | and he is not flogged | Makkot 16a:11 | <b>R' Elazar said to</b> R' Yoḥanan: <b>Which</b> is that other mitzva? R' Yoḥanan <b>said to him: </b> You will know <b>when you discover it</b> yourself. R' Elazar <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> the answer, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who divorced</b> the woman he raped, <b>if he is a non-priest, he remarries</b> her, <b>and he is not flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>And if he is a priest, </b> he is <b>flogged</b> for violating the prohibition, <b>and he does not remarry</b> her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | and one positive mitzva: | Temurah 4b:7 | The Talmud counters: <b>But there is</b> the case of the <b>rapist</b> who forces himself upon a virgin, who is obligated to marry the victim if she wishes and is then prohibited from divorcing her. <b>As</b> here the verse states <b>one prohibition: </b> “He may not send her away all his days,” <b>and one positive mitzva: </b> “And she shall be his wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This teaches that he can rectify the transgression of divorcing her by remarrying her. <b>And</b> yet, the <b>one positive mitzva does not come and uproot</b> the <b>prohibition, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who</b> married and then <b>divorced</b> his victim, <b>if he is an Israelite, </b> who is permitted to marry a divorcée, <b>he remarries</b> her <b>and he is not flogged. But if he is a priest, </b> who is prohibited from marrying a divorcée, <b>he is flogged and he does not remarry</b> her. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | all his days” | Temurah 5a:2 | The Talmud answers that Rava could <b>say to you: </b> It <b>is different there, as the verse states: </b> “He may not send her away <b>all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). This teaches that for <b>all his days, </b> he remains <b>under</b> the obligation to <b>arise and remarry</b> her. Once he remarries her, it turns out that he did not divorce her for all of his days and therefore did not violate the prohibition. This is why he is not flogged. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | all his days” | Temurah 5a:5 | The Talmud answers that it <b>is different there, as God states: </b> “He may not send her away <b>all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), which teaches that for <b>all his days, </b> he remains <b>under</b> the obligation to <b>arise and remarry</b> her. Therefore, it is only in this specific case that the divorce is not effective. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | as it is written: “And the man who lay with her must give the maiden’s father fifty shekels of silver” | Yevamot 4a:10 | <b>And from where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the verse <b>is written with regard to a woman raped by his father? </b> It is <b>from the previous</b> verse, which deals with the <i>halakhot</i> of rape, <b>as it is written: “And the man who lay with her must give the maiden’s father fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“A man shall not take his father’s wife</b> and shall not uncover his father’s skirt. ” This shows that R' Yehuda does derive homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed verses in Deuteronomy. |
| Deuteronomy 22:29 | “And the man who lay with her shall give the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver” | Yevamot 97a:19 | <b>And from where</b> is it apparent <b>that</b> this verse <b>is written with regard to a woman raped</b> by his father and not with regard to his father’s wife? It is <b>as it is written</b> just <b>before that verse, </b> with regard to rape: <b>“And the man who lay with her shall give the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt” | Berakhot 21b:13 | <b>And R' Yehuda prohibits</b> him from marrying <b>a woman raped by his father and a woman seduced by his father. And Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reason for R' Yehuda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1). The last expression, “and shall not uncover his father’s skirt,” implies that: <b>A skirt that has been seen by his father, </b> i.e., any woman who has had sex with his father, <b>may not be uncovered</b> by his son, i.e., his son may not marry her. |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | With regard to a son it is explicitly written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife” | Kiddushin 67b:9 | <b>R' Abba objects to this: But</b> one can <b>say</b> and explain that the term <b>“another”</b> in the verse indicates: <b>But not to</b> her husband’s <b>son, </b> i.e., betrothal is ineffective only in the case of a prohibition that warrants court-imposed capital punishment, not one that warrants <i>karet</i>. The Talmud rejects this suggestion: <b>With regard to a son it is explicitly written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1), which means that betrothal is ineffective in this situation. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the emphasis of the term <b>“another”? Learn from</b> this term <b>that</b> she may marry <b>others but not relatives. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | What is Rabbi Akiva’s reasoning? As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and he shall not uncover his father’s cloak” | Yevamot 49a:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>What is R' Akiva’s reasoning? As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and he shall not uncover his father’s cloak”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1). This teaches that a <b>cloak that his father saw, </b> i.e., a woman with whom his father had sex, the son <b>may not uncover. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | “And he shall not | Yevamot 49a:8 | The Talmud answers: <b>They derive</b> it <b>from</b> the verse that states: <b>“And he shall not</b> uncover his father’s cloak” (Deuteronomy 23:1). The word “and” is superfluous and serves to include additional cases. |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt” | Yevamot 4a:9 | <b>And Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reason for R' Yehuda’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1). The latter expression: “And shall not uncover his father’s skirt,” is referring to <b>a skirt that has been seen by his father, </b> i.e., any woman who has had sex with his father <b>may not be uncovered</b> by his son, meaning that his son may not marry her. |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | as it is written: “A man may not take his father’s wife, and may not uncover his father’s skirt” | Yevamot 97a:18 | § It is taught in the Mishnah that <b>R' Yehuda prohibits</b> marrying <b>a woman raped by his father</b> or a woman seduced by his father. <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reasoning</b> for the ruling <b>of R' Yehuda? </b> It is <b>as it is written: “A man may not take his father’s wife, and may not uncover his father’s skirt”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1), meaning that <b>one may not uncover</b> the <b>skirt that his father has seen. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:1 | now that it is not juxtaposed with it, | Yevamot 97a:20 | <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis, </b> who disagree with R' Yehuda, respond to this proof? <b>If</b> the prohibition stated <b>had been juxtaposed with</b> the verse dealing with rape, it would be <b>as you said. </b> However, <b>now that it is not juxtaposed with it, </b> as there is another prohibition in between, namely “a man may not take his father’s wife” (Deuteronomy 23:1), the prohibition of “he may not uncover his father’s skirt” <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>that which Rav Anan</b> taught, <b>as Rav Anan said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The verse is speaking of a widow waiting for her brother-in-law, </b> who is this man’s <b>father, </b> to perform levirate marriage. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“his father’s skirt”? </b> The <b>skirt that is potentially his father’s, he may not uncover. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | is discharged gently | Chullin 48a:9 | <b>As isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man’s penis was <b>perforated, </b> he is <b>unfit</b> to marry a Jewish woman of fit lineage, <b>because</b> his semen <b>is discharged gently</b> and he cannot procreate, in accordance with the verse: “He that is crushed or maimed in his private parts shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:2). But if the perforation <b>was</b> later <b>sealed</b> with flesh, he is <b>fit, because</b> now <b>he can procreate. And this is</b> an instance of someone who is <b>unfit who returns to his</b> previous state of <b>fitness. </b> Rav Yosef continues: When the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And this is, what does it</b> serve <b>to exclude? </b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude a case like this, </b> where the lung was perforated and then sealed by the chest wall, in which case the animal would not become kosher again? |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | “He shall not enter” | Kiddushin 74b:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us</b> with this? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 49a): <b>Who is a <i>mamzer</i>? Any</b> offspring <b>who is</b> born of a union prohibited by the verse: <b>“He shall not enter”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:2). In other words, if the union was a violation of any kind of prohibition, even that of a prohibition that is not subject to the punishment of <i>karet</i>, the child is a <i>mamzer</i>; this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | because it is stated: “One with crushed testicles | Yevamot 20b:5 | The inverse is also true: If <b>the brothers died</b> childless, <b>and</b> the infertile men <b>proceeded to perform levirate betrothal with their wives, </b> or <b>gave a bill of divorce, or performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, whatever they did is done</b> and took effect. <b>And if they had sex</b> with their <i>yevama</i>, <b>they</b> thereby <b>acquired</b> the <i>yevama</i> as their wife. However, <b>it is forbidden to maintain them, </b> i.e., allow them to continue to live as husband and wife, <b>because it is stated: “One with crushed testicles</b> or whose penis has been severed shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:2); they are prohibited from entering the congregation, i.e., marrying a Jew. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that women who are forbidden, as he would be <b>liable</b> for the violation of <b>a prohibition, require <i>ḥalitza</i> by Torah</b> law <b>but do not require levirate marriage, then</b> one could ask: <b>if they had sex why are they acquired</b> as wives even though there would be no mitzva of levirate marriage because the men are prohibited from marrying them? |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | who betrothed the daughter of an Israelite, | Yevamot 56b:17 | <b>R' Elazar said</b> that <b>R' Oshaya said: </b> In the case of <b>a priest with crushed testicles</b> or with other wounds to his genitals <b>who betrothed the daughter of an Israelite, </b> which is prohibited by the verse “He that is crushed or maimed shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:2), <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>R' Meir</b> on the one hand <b>and R' Elazar and R' Shimon</b> on the other. |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | shall not enter | Yevamot 75b:3 | A similar idea <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. It is stated: “A man wounded [<i>petzua</i>]</b> with crushed testicles [<i>dakka</i>] or a severed [<i>kerut</i>] penis <b>shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:2), <b>and it is stated</b> in the very next verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>, his blemish was created <b>at the hands of man, </b> i.e., by his parents who sinned, <b>so too, here, </b> with regard to one with crushed testicles, the verse must be speaking about one whose mutilation was <b>at the hands of man. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | as it is stated: “A man wounded with crushed testicles or a severed penis shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Yevamot 76a:10 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>A man with crushed testicles</b> or with other wounds to his genitals <b>and one whose penis has been severed are permitted</b> to marry a female <b>convert or an emancipated</b> female slave, <b>and they are prohibited only from entering into the congregation</b> and marrying a woman who was born Jewish, <b>as it is stated: “A man wounded with crushed testicles or a severed penis shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:2). |
| Deuteronomy 23:2 | because it is stated: “A man with crushed testicles or a severed penis shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Yevamot 79b:14 | If <b>the brothers</b> of these sexually impaired men <b>died, and</b> the sexually impaired men <b>proceeded to perform levirate betrothal with their</b> brothers’ <b>wives, </b> or <b>gave</b> them <b>a bill of divorce, or performed <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with them, <b>what they did is done, </b> i.e., it is a valid act. <b>And if they had sex</b> with their brothers’ wives <b>they acquired</b> them in levirate marriage, <b>but</b> they are <b>prohibited from maintaining them</b> as their wives <b>because it is stated: “A man with crushed testicles or a severed penis shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:2). <b>Apparently, we are dealing with</b> a case where the eunuch’s brother had married a woman who is <b>in the congregation</b> of YHWH, i.e., a Jew from birth who is governed by this prohibition, and not a convert. |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | of his | Kiddushin 69a:8 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>R' Eliezer says: This</b> son <b>is a <i>mamzer</i> slave. R' Elazar said: What is the reason of R' Eliezer? As the verse states</b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>: “Even to the 10th generation none <b>of his</b> shall enter the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates that in the case of the child of a <i>mamzer</i> and a Canaanite female slave, one <b>follows his</b> parent with the <b>flawed</b> lineage, and the child is a <i>mamzer</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | the Torah states: “A mamzer shall not enter | Kiddushin 73a:10 | <b>And</b> in any case, this does not suffice to prevent her <i>shetuki</i> child from marrying a Jew with unflawed lineage, since <b>the Torah states: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates: <b>It is a definite <i>mamzer</i> who may not enter, but</b> one who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> as a result <b>of an uncertainty may enter. </b> Similarly, <b>it is into a congregation</b> of those with <b>definite</b> unflawed lineage that <b>he may not enter, but into a congregation</b> of those with <b>uncertain</b> lineage <b>he may enter. </b> Therefore, even if it is uncertain if one is a <i>mamzer</i>, by Torah law he may marry a Jew with unflawed lineage. |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | And the Torah states: “A mamzer shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Kiddushin 73a:15 | <b>Since there are</b> many other cases of <b>unmarried</b> women who do abandon their children although those children have unflawed lineage, <b>and there are also</b> children with unflawed lineage who are abandoned by their parents <b>due to hunger, </b> the concern that the child is a <i>mamzer</i> <b>is</b> no more than <b>half and half, </b> i.e., fifty percent. <b>And the Torah states: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates: <b>It is</b> one who is <b>a definite <i>mamzer</i> who may not enter, but</b> one who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> as a result <b>of an uncertainty may enter. </b> Similarly, <b>it is into a congregation</b> of those with <b>definite</b> unflawed lineage that <b>he may not enter, but into a congregation</b> of those with <b>uncertain</b> lineage <b>he may enter. </b> This child is a <i>mamzer</i> as the result of an uncertainty, and by Torah law may marry a Jew with unflawed lineage. |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | “A mamzer shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Kiddushin 73a:2 | <b>And if you wish, say: So too, </b> R' Yehuda agrees with R' Yosei that Levites and priests <b>are two congregations, </b> since there are special <i>halakhot</i> of marriage that apply only to priests. Rather, R' Yehuda holds that the permissibility of the marriage of <b>a <i>mamzer</i> with a <i>shetuki</i> and a <i>shetuki</i> with an Israelite</b> is <b>derived from one</b> instance of the word <b>“congregation, ”</b> from the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3). |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | “A mamzer shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Yevamot 49a:6 | The Talmud completes its explanation of R' Akiva’s opinion: <b>And in close proximity to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Apparently, </b> even <b>from these</b> forbidden sex, which render one liable for the violation of a prohibition, the offspring <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | “A mamzer shall not enter | Yevamot 49a:9 | <b>And Shimon HaTimni holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: </b> It is <b>with regard to the widow waiting for his father</b> to perform <b>levirate marriage that the verse is speaking, </b> and it indicates <b>that she is</b> one of the women with whom sex <b>render one liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And in close proximity to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Apparently, </b> only the offspring of a union <b>for which one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> is a <i>mamzer</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | entering. | Yevamot 55b:1 | <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>entering</b> and <b>entering. </b> The verse states in the context of a prohibition: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3), and in the context of a prohibition derived from a positive mitzva: “The children that are born to them of the 3rd generation may enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9). Consequently, these types of prohibitions are equated. |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | “A mamzer shall not enter | Yevamot 75b:3 | A similar idea <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. It is stated: “A man wounded [<i>petzua</i>]</b> with crushed testicles [<i>dakka</i>] or a severed [<i>kerut</i>] penis <b>shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:2), <b>and it is stated</b> in the very next verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>, his blemish was created <b>at the hands of man, </b> i.e., by his parents who sinned, <b>so too, here, </b> with regard to one with crushed testicles, the verse must be speaking about one whose mutilation was <b>at the hands of man. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:3 | “tenth” | Yevamot 78b:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Reish Lakish said: A <i>mamzeret</i>, </b> a female <i>mamzer</i>, <b>is permitted after ten generations. </b> Why? He <b>derived</b> this <i>halakha</i> by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“10th”</b> stated in relation <b>to an Ammonite and a Moabite</b> in the verse “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH; even to the 10th generation shall none of them enter into the congregation of YHWH forever” (Deuteronomy 23:4), and the word <b>“10th”</b> stated in relation to a <i>mamzer</i> in the verse “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH; even to the 10th generation shall none of his enter into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:3) He explained the analogy as follows: <b>Just as below, </b> with regard to an Ammonite and a Moabite, <b>females are permitted, so too here, </b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>females are permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | Wasn’t it already stated: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; | Berakhot 28a:6 | <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: You are forbidden to enter into the congregation.

How can you permit him to enter the congregation? <b>R' Yehoshua said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Do Ammon and Moab reside in their place? Sennacherib already came and, </b> through his policy of population transfer, <b>scrambled all the nations</b> and settled other nations in place of Ammon. Consequently, the current residents of Ammon and Moab are not ethnic Ammonites and Moabites, <b>as it is stated in</b> reference to Sennacherib: <b>“I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants”</b> (Isaiah 10:13). <b>And</b> although it is conceivable that this particular convert is an ethnic Ammonite, nevertheless, there is no need for concern due to the halakhic principle: <b>Anything that parts</b> from a group <b>parts from the majority, </b> and the assumption is that he is from the majority of nations whose members are permitted to enter the congregation. |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | Rav Pappa says: The swamp rooster is forbidden, but the swamphen is permitted. And your mnemonic | Chullin 62b:7 | <b>Abaye says: The swamp rooster is one of the eight uncertain</b> cases, <b>and this is</b> the <b><i>mardu</i>, </b> i.e., the <i>marda</i> mentioned earlier. <b>Rav Pappa says: The swamp rooster is forbidden, but the swamphen is permitted.

Mareimar taught: The swamphen is forbidden, </b> because the rabbis <b>saw that it claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it. <b>And this is</b> the <b><i>giruta</i>, </b> a non-kosher bird (see 109b). |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | introduced contention between Israel and Ammon, as it is stated: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Horayot 10b:13 | Apropos Lot, <b>Rabba taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A brother betrayed a strong city, and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother betrayed a strong city”; that is Lot, who parted from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> is stated <b>because he, </b> i.e., Lot, <b>introduced contention between Israel and Ammon, as it is stated: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4). |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | is there | Kiddushin 67b:6 | The Talmud discusses the second clause of R' Yoḥanan’s statement: If <b>they converted, follow the flawed</b> lineage <b>of the two. To which</b> case does this refer? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to an Egyptian man who married an Ammonite woman, what flawed</b> lineage <b>is there</b> here? The lineage of an Ammonite woman who converts is not flawed at all, as the rabbis expounded that the verse: “An Ammonite…shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:4) is referring to <b>an Ammonite man but not an Ammonite woman, </b> which means that she can marry a Jew of unflawed lineage. |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” | Nazir 23b:1 | <b>and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, ” this is Lot, </b> called Abraham’s brother (see Genesis 14:14), <b>who separated from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle, ”</b> this is <b>because</b> Lot <b>brought contention</b> between the Jewish people and his own descendants <b>like bars, </b> which lock the gates of <b>a castle. </b> Just as no one can enter a locked castle, so too Lot’s descendants, Ammon and Moab, were prevented from joining the Jewish people, as it states: <b>“An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4). |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | And your mnemonic | Niddah 50b:7 | <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember which animal is permitted and which is prohibited is the well-known statement of the rabbis with regard to the verse: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:4). <b>An Ammonite</b> man is unfit to enter the assembly <b>but not an Ammonite woman. </b> Here too, the animal with a female name is permitted, whereas the one with a male name is prohibited. <b>Mareimar taught: The marsh hen is prohibited, </b> contrary to the opinion of Rav Pappa, as <b>the rabbis saw that it mauled and ate</b> its prey. <b>And this is</b> the <b><i>geiruta</i>, </b> a non-kosher bird. |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | in which it is written: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” | Yevamot 16b:7 | <b>And R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> further <b>said</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her treasures; </b> for she has seen that the heathens have entered into her Temple, concerning which You commanded that they should not enter into Your congregation” (Lamentations 1:10)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>Ammon and Moab. </b> How so? <b>When the non-Jews entered the Sanctuary, all turned to</b> plunder <b>the silver and the gold, and</b> the soldiers from Ammon and Moab <b>turned to the scrolls of Torah</b> to destroy them. <b>They said: </b> Is <b>this</b> the scroll <b>in which it is written: “An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4)? <b>Let it be burnt by fire. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | learned | Yevamot 76b:15 | <b>Abner said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> that there is no room for such concern. As the verse states: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:4), teaching that <b>an Ammonite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman; </b> and similarly, <b>a Moabite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not a Moabite woman. </b> Doeg said to him: <b>However, if that is so, </b> say that the verse that renders it prohibited for a <i>mamzer</i> to enter the congregation renders prohibited only a male <b><i>mamzer</i>, but not a female <i>mamzer</i>. </b> Abner replied: <b>It is written: “A <i>mamzer</i>, ”</b> which should be understood not as a noun but as an adjective, denoting <b>a strange blemish [<i>mum zar</i>], </b> one who is defective due to a forbidden relationship, and this applies to males and females alike. |
| Deuteronomy 23:4 | tanna’im : | Yevamot 77a:4 | The Talmud comments that this disagreement with regard to the source of the <i>halakha</i> that it is permitted for an Ammonite or Moabite woman to enter into the congregation is <b>like the</b> following dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: </b> The verse states: “An Ammonite or a Moabite” (Deuteronomy 23:4); <b>an Ammonite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman, </b> and similarly, <b>a Moabite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not a Moabite woman. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda, </b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the masculine form of these two terms. <b>R' Shimon says: </b> The verse states: <b>“Because they did not meet you with bread and with water</b> on the way” (Deuteronomy 23:5).

| Deuteronomy 23:5 | is explicit: “Because they did not meet you with bread and with water | Yevamot 76b:16 | Doeg retorted: If so, say that it is prohibited for only <b>an Egyptian</b> man to enter into the congregation, <b>but not an Egyptian woman. </b> Abner answered: <b>Here it is different, as the reason for</b> the prohibition recorded in this <b>verse</b> with regard to Ammonites <b>is explicit: “Because they did not meet you with bread and with water</b> on the way, when you came forth out of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 23:5). Since <b>it is the way of a man</b> to go forth <b>to meet</b> guests <b>but it is not the way of a woman</b> to go forth, females were not included in this prohibition.

| Deuteronomy 23:5 | “Because they did not meet you with bread and with water | Yevamot 77a:4 | The Talmud comments that this disagreement with regard to the source of the <i>halakha</i> that it is permitted for an Ammonite or Moabite woman to enter into the congregation is <b>like the</b> following dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: </b> The verse states: “An Ammonite or a Moabite” (Deuteronomy 23:4); <b>an Ammonite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman, </b> and similarly, <b>a Moabite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not a Moabite woman. </b> This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda, </b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the masculine form of these two terms. <b>R' Shimon says: </b> The verse states: <b>“Because they did not meet you with bread and with water</b> on the way” (Deuteronomy 23:5).

| Deuteronomy 23:6 | but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you” | Berakhot 55b:8 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>Three transformations: </b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing; </b><b><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12); <b><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; </b><b><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12); <b>and: <b>“Nevertheless YHWH your God would not hearken unto Balaam; </b><br><b>but YHWH your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). |
| Deuteronomy 23:6 | synagogues and study halls, as it is stated: “And the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loved you” | Sanhedrin 105b:19 | <b>R' Abba bar Kahana says: All of</b> the blessings ultimately <b>reverted to</b> be fulfilled as the <b>curse</b> that he originally intended, as all of those circumstances befell the Jewish people, <b>except for</b> the destruction of <b>synagogues and study halls, as it is stated: “And YHWH your God transformed the curse into a blessing for you, because YHWH your God loved you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6). <b>A curse</b> in the singular, <b>not curses</b> in the plural, was transformed permanently. |
| Deuteronomy 23:8 | as it is written: “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land” | Bava Kamma92b:15 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: </b> If there is <b>a well that you drank from, do not throw a stone into it? </b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). Since you dwelled in their lands, you may not cause them harm. |
| Deuteronomy 23:8 | “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land” | Berakhot 63b:22 | <b>R' Yosei began</b> to speak <b>in honor of the hosts, and taught: </b> It is said: <b>“You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as the Egyptians, who only befriended Israel, </b> even when they hosted them, <b>for their own benefit, </b> as Pharaoh said to Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle”</b> (Genesis 47:6), are treated <b>this way, all the more so</b> should <b>one who hosts a Torah scholar in his home, providing him with food and drink and availing him of his possessions</b> without concern for personal gain, be treated this way. |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | Egyptian, whose offspring is not unfit, as the verse states: “The children of the third generation that are born to them may enter into the congregation of the Lord” | Kiddushin 75a:4 | <b>And R' Yosei holds</b> that the derivation is as follows: It is <b>like a High Priest</b> who has sex <b>with a widow: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest</b> who has sex <b>with a widow, whose offspring is unfit</b> for the priesthood, as they have the status of a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>and he</b> similarly <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by having sex with her, <b>so too, anyone whose offspring is unfit</b> for the priesthood also <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by having sex with her. This comparison serves <b>to exclude a second</b>-generation <b>Egyptian, whose offspring is not unfit, as the verse states: “The children of the 3rd generation that are born to them may enter into the congregation of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:9). Therefore, a second-generation Egyptian does not disqualify a woman with whom he has sex from marrying a priest. |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | a positive mitzva, | Yevamot 55a:26 | The Talmud asks further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the initial stage of sex is considered an act of sex with regard to <b>those liable</b> to receive punishment for violating <b>a positive mitzva, </b> e.g., one who has sex with an Egyptian or Edomite convert? The verse states: “The children that are born to them of the 3rd generation may enter into the assembly of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9). It is therefore a positive mitzva that only the grandchildren of these converts may have sex with a Jew. |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | Egyptian, whose children are not unfit, as it is written: “The children of the third generation that are born to them may enter into the assembly of the Lord” | Yevamot 69a:15 | <b>And R' Yosei</b> also <b>reasoned: </b> This is <b>like a High Priest</b> who had sex with a widow. <b>Just as</b> the <b>High Priest’s children are unfit</b> for the priesthood, <b>and he</b> himself <b>disqualifies</b> the widow from marrying into the priesthood, <b>so too, any</b> man <b>whose children are unfit</b> to marry Jews of unflawed lineage <b>disqualifies</b> a woman with whom he had sex from marrying into the priesthood. This inference comes <b>to exclude a second-</b>generation <b>Egyptian, whose children are not unfit, as it is written: “The children of the 3rd generation that are born to them may enter into the assembly of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:9). |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | sons | Yevamot 77b:21 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon said to them: I am stating a</b> traditional <b><i>halakha</i>, and furthermore a verse supports me, </b> as the verse with regard to Edomites and Egyptians states: “The <b>sons</b> of the 3rd generation that are born to them may enter to them, the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9), teaching that the prohibition applies to their sons, <b>but not</b> to their <b>daughters. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | that are born to them | Yevamot 78a:18 | Rav Dimi <b>was silent, </b> momentarily unable to find an answer. Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps it is different there, </b> with regard to Egyptian converts, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to them: “The sons of the 3rd generation <b>that are born to them</b> may enter to them, the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9), indicating that <b>the verse made</b> their prohibition <b>dependent on birth, </b> and therefore the child of Egyptian converts is assigned to the mother. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: </b> Man of great <b>skull, </b> i.e., man of distinction, <b>I saw your head between the pillars</b> of the study hall <b>when R' Yoḥanan taught this <i>halakha</i>. </b> In other words, you grasped the meaning as though you were actually present in the study hall and heard the statement from R' Yoḥanan himself. |
| Deuteronomy 23:9 | The Sages taught | Yevamot 78a:4 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with respect to Egyptian and Edomite converts that “the sons of the 3rd generation that are born to them may enter to them, the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9). <b>If it is stated “sons” why is it</b> also <b>stated “generation, ” and if it is stated “generation” why is it</b> also <b>stated “sons”? </b> One of these terms seems superfluous. The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>If it</b> had <b>stated</b> only <b>“sons” and not stated “generation, ” I would say</b> that the prohibition depends on the number of the son, meaning that the <b>first and second sons</b> of an Egyptian convert are <b>forbidden, </b> whereas the <b>3rd</b> is <b>permitted. Therefore, it is stated “generation”</b> to indicate that the prohibition depends not on the number of the son but on his generation. |
| Deuteronomy 23:10 | “And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing” | Avodah Zarah20a:12 | <b>But is it permitted to gaze</b> upon a woman? The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10); this teaches <b>that a person should not gaze upon a beautiful woman, even</b> if she is <b>unmarried; and</b> a person should not gaze upon <b>a married woman, even</b> if she is <b>ugly; </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:10 | “And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing” | Avodah Zarah20b:9 | § The Talmud cites another source that interprets the verse cited above. <b>A baraita states</b> a <i>baraita</i> explaining the verse: <b>“And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is immediately followed by the verse: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches <b>that a person should not think</b> impure thoughts <b>by day and</b> thereby <b>come to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of an emission <b>by night. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:10 | from: “Then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing [ davar ra ]” | Ketubot 46a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>warning, </b> i.e., the prohibition that serves as the source for the flogging <b>for a defamer? R' Elazar says</b> that the prohibition is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>“You shall not go up and down as talebearer”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). <b>R' Natan says</b> that it is derived <b>from: “Then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing [<i>davar ra</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is expounded to mean <i>dibbur ra</i>, evil speech. |
| Deuteronomy 23:11 | happens to him by night” | Bava Kamma25a:11 | <b>And if you would say</b> that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>was not necessary</b> to teach that the seminal emission of the <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity <b>by contact, as it is</b> certainly <b>no less</b> impure <b>than</b> if it had come from <b>a man</b> who was <b>pure, </b> so the inference was necessary only to teach that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by carrying, this is not correct. In fact, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach this point, as it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “If there be among you any man that is not clean because of something that <b>happens to him by night”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:11), this means that a seminal emission is ritually impure if it came from <b>someone who</b> had something <b>happen to him, </b> and this <b>causes him</b> to experience the emission, but the verse is <b>excluding this</b> <i>zav</i>, who did <b>not</b> have something <b>happen to him</b> to <b>cause him</b> to experience the emission, but <b>rather another matter, </b> i.e., his gonorrhea-like condition, <b>caused him</b> to experience the emission. Consequently, it <b>teaches us</b> that this is incorrect. |
| Deuteronomy 23:11 | by Shmuel, as Shmuel raises a contradiction: It is written: “If there be among you any man who is not pure, by reason of that which chances him by night, | Nazir 66a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and R' Yosei <b>disagree? </b> What is the basis of their dispute? The Talmud answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the following issue discussed <b>by Shmuel, as Shmuel raises a contradiction: It is written: “If there be among you any man who is not pure, by reason of that which chances him by night, </b> then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This verse is applied to a <i>zav</i> who experienced a seminal emission. <b>And it is written: “When evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water, </b> and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp” (Deuteronomy 23:12). |
| Deuteronomy 23:11 | ritually impure, as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him | Niddah 43a:15 | <b>Some say another version</b> of the previous discussion. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize, </b> i.e., impregnate a woman. The Talmud infers: <b>It cannot fertilize, but it does render</b> the man who emits it <b>ritually impure, as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him</b> by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches that <b>even mere semen</b> which cannot fertilize renders one impure. |
| Deuteronomy 23:11 | as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure [ asher lo yihye tahor ] by reason of that which happened to him by night” | Pesachim 3a:11 | <b>Rav Pappa said: </b> A different verse added <b>nine</b> letters, <b>as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure [<i>asher lo yihye tahor</i>] by reason of that which happened to him by night”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:11). To avoid using the three-letter Hebrew word for impure, <i>tameh</i>, spelled <i>tet</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>alef</i>, the verse employs the twelve-letter phrase “who is not ritually pure,” spelled: <i>Alef</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>reish</i>; <i>lamed</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>reish</i>. <b>Ravina said: </b> The verse actually adds <b>ten</b> letters because of the letter <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b><i>tahor</i>, </b> as the word is spelled in its plene form. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </b> Yet another verse adds <b>sixteen</b> letters, <b>as it is stated: “For he said, something has happened to him, he is not ritually pure; surely he is not ritually pure [<i>bilti tahor hu ki lo tahor</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 20:26). To avoid using the three-letter word <i>tameh</i>, the verse employs the nineteen-letter phrase “he is not ritually pure; surely he is not ritually pure,” spelled: <i>Beit</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>yod</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>reish</i>; <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>kaf</i>, <i>yod</i>; <i>lamed</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>reish</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 23:11 | before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: | Pesachim 68a:6 | <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: </b> “If there be among you a man that is impure by reason of a nocturnal occurrence, he shall go outside the camp, he shall not come within the camp” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This verse may be expounded as follows: <b>“He shall go outside the camp, ” this is the camp of the Shekhina. “He shall not come within the camp, ” this is the Levite camp. From here</b> we derive that <b>a person who experienced a seminal emission must go out from two camps. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:12 | And it is written: “When evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water, | Nazir 66a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and R' Yosei <b>disagree? </b> What is the basis of their dispute? The Talmud answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the following issue discussed <b>by Shmuel, as Shmuel raises a contradiction: It is written: “If there be among you any man who is not pure, by reason of that which chances him by night, </b> then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This verse is applied to a <i>zav</i> who experienced a seminal emission. <b>And it is written: “When evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water, </b> and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp” (Deuteronomy 23:12). |
| Deuteronomy 23:13 | it is written: “You shall also have a place outside the camp, to which you will go” | Berakhot 25a:15 | <b>And in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yonatan, as R' Yonatan</b> raised a <b>contradiction</b> between two verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “You shall also have a place outside the camp, to which you will go”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:13), meaning that one must exit the camp before attending to his bodily needs but there is no obligation to cover it; <b>and it is written</b> in another verse: <b>“And you shall have a spade</b> among your weapons; and when you ease yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and turn back <b>and cover your excrement”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:14), indicating a clear obligation to conceal one’s excrement. |
| Deuteronomy 23:13 | where you can relieve yourself | Yoma 75b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I establish</b> the verses: <b>“And you shall have a spade among your weapons, </b> and it shall be that when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement” (Deuteronomy 23:14) and “You shall have a place also outside the camp <b>where you can relieve yourself</b> ” (Deuteronomy 23:13). From here we learn that there was waste in their bowels, as they had to leave the camp to relieve themselves. The Talmud explains: This waste was not a byproduct of the manna; it was from food <b>items that the non-Jew merchants sold them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:14 | and cover your excrement” | Berakhot 25a:15 | <b>And in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yonatan, as R' Yonatan</b> raised a <b>contradiction</b> between two verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “You shall also have a place outside the camp, to which you will go”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:13), meaning that one must exit the camp before attending to his bodily needs but there is no obligation to cover it; <b>and it is written</b> in another verse: <b>“And you shall have a spade</b> among your weapons; and when you ease yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and turn back <b>and cover your excrement”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:14), indicating a clear obligation to conceal one’s excrement. |

| Deuteronomy 23:14 | “And you shall have a spade among your weapons, | Yoma 75b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I establish</b> the verses: <b>“And you shall have a spade among your weapons, </b> and it shall be that when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement” (Deuteronomy 23:14) and “You shall have a place also outside the camp <b>where you can relieve yourself</b> ” (Deuteronomy 23:13).

| Deuteronomy 23:15 | As it is written: “And He see no unseemly thing in you” | Bava Metzia114b:1 | Rabba bar Avuh now asks Elijah another question: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a naked person that he may not separate <i>teruma</i>? </b> He replied: <b>As it is written: “And He see no unseemly thing in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). This verse indicates that one may not recite any words of sanctity, including the blessing upon separating <i>teruma</i>, in front of one who is naked. |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | “And your camp shall be holy” | Berakhot 25a:11 | <b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: There, </b> in the case of tzara'at, <b>it is contingent upon the permanence</b> of the place, <b>as</b> with regard to the metzora <b>it is written: “He shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his dwelling be”</b> (Leviticus 13:46). His impurity is in his permanent dwelling-place. <b>Here, </b> with regard to the obligation to distance oneself from something repulsive, <b>the Torah stated</b> the principle: <b>“And your camp shall be holy”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), <b>and there is no</b> holiness in those circumstances. |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | it is prohibited to recite Shema ; the Torah said: “And no indecent thing shall be seen in you” | Berakhot 25b:9 | <b>Rava said: Opposite feces</b> covered only <b>by</b> a <b>lantern</b>-like covering, which is transparent, <b>it is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>. </b> But <b>opposite nakedness</b> covered only <b>by</b> a <b>lantern-</b>like covering, <b>it is prohibited to recite <i>Shema</i>.

| Deuteronomy 23:15 | therefore, your camp shall be sacred | Shabbat 150a:7 | <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna raised a contradiction to Rava: Did R' Yoḥanan</b> really <b>state</b> as a general principle that <b>speaking is prohibited, </b> but <b>contemplating is permitted? Consequently, </b> we can derive from here that <b>contemplation is not tantamount to speech. But Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: It is permitted to think</b> about Torah <b>in any place except for a bathhouse and a bathroom. </b> This statement indicates that contemplation is tantamount to speech, as even thought is prohibited in these locations. The Talmud answers: <b>It is different there, for</b> with regard to Torah <b>we need</b> to fulfill the verse: “For YHWH your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to give your enemies before you; <b>therefore, your camp shall be sacred</b> so that He see no unseemly thing in you and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15); <b>and</b> the requirement to be sacred is <b>not</b> fulfilled if one thinks about Torah while in the bathhouse or bathroom. |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | it is written: “So that He see no unseemly thing [ davar ] in you” | Shabbat 150a:8 | The Talmud challenges this: But <b>here, too, </b> with regard to a bathhouse and a bathroom, <b>it is written: “So that He see no unseemly thing [<i>davar</i>] in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). We can infer that this prohibits speech [<i>dibbur</i>] but not contemplation. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse is not referring to speech. <b>It is needed for</b> the ruling of <b>Rav Yehuda, for Rav Yehuda said: Opposite a naked non-Jew, it is prohibited to recite <i>Shema</i>, </b> as this is included in the prohibition of unseemly things mentioned above. |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | “Therefore shall your camp be holy; | Shabbat 23a:8 | <b>Rav Amram raised an objection</b> from that which we learned in a Mishnah: With regard to <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>], </b> i.e., grain that was acquired from an <i>am ha</i>’<i>aretz</i> about which there is uncertainty whether or not he tithed it; <b>one may</b> use it <b>to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, </b> i.e., joining of courtyards and joining of borders, <b>and to establish the merging of alleys, and one recites a blessing</b> before and after eating <b>it, and one invites a quorum</b> for recitation of Grace after Meals after eating <b>it. </b> Although the rabbis said that one is required to separate tithes from <i>demai</i>, they allowed it to be used for specific purposes and in exigent circumstances. <b>And</b> they said that <b>one may separate</b> the tithe from <i>demai</i> when he is <b>naked and at dusk</b> Shabbat eve, a time when separating tithes from actual untithed produce [<i>tevel</i>] is prohibited. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>every</b> action instituted by <b>rabbinic ordinance requires a blessing, </b> as fulfillment of rabbinic ordinances is based on the mitzva: You shall not turn aside, <b>here, when</b> he <b>stands naked, how</b> can he <b>recite a blessing? Don’t we require</b> fulfillment of the mitzva: <b>“Therefore shall your camp be holy; </b> that He see no unseemly thing in you, and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15)? <b>And</b> the camp <b>is not</b> holy when one recites a blessing in a state of nakedness. <b>Abaye said: </b> There is room to distinguish between the cases: In <b>a case</b> where there is a <b>definite</b> mitzva <b>by rabbinic law, a blessing is required. </b> In a case where there is a <b>rabbinic</b> ordinance instituted due to <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to the circumstances, as in the case of <i>demai</i>, which may or may not have been tithed already, <b>a blessing is not required. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | that He see no licentious matter in you, | Sotah 21a:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> Doeg and Ahithophel <b>interpret</b> incorrectly, causing them to err? They interpreted this verse: “For YHWH your God walks in the midst of your camp…to give up your enemies before you…<b>that He see no licentious matter in you, </b> and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15), to indicate that God turns away from one who engaged in forbidden sex, and since David had sinned with Bathsheba God must have turned away from him. <b>But they did not know that a transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva, but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:15 | as it is stated: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp” | Sotah 3b:12 | <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Initially, before the Jewish people sinned, the Shekhina resided with each and every one</b> of them, <b>as it is stated: “For YHWH your God walks in the midst of your camp”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). <b>Once they sinned, the Shekhina withdrew from them, as it is stated</b> in that same verse: <b>“That He see no unseemly matter in you, and turn away from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), teaching that when there is an “unseemly matter” among the Jewish people, the Shekhina no longer resides among them. |
| Deuteronomy 23:16 | the verse states: “You shall not deliver to his master a slave who escaped to you from his master” | Gittin 45a:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the residents of the Land of Canaan: <b>“They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you to sin against Me, </b> for you will serve their gods; for they will be a snare to you” (Exodus 23:33). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the verse is</b> also <b>speaking of a non-Jew who accepted upon himself not to</b> engage in <b>idol worship, </b> and is teaching that such a non-Jew may not dwell in Eretz Yisrael as well; therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall not deliver to his master a slave who escaped to you from his master”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16). The <i>baraita</i> understands that the verse is speaking in metaphoric terms about a non-Jew who has come to Eretz Yisrael, escaping his idolatrous past. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is this non-Jew’s <b>remedy? “He shall dwell with you in your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:17). This teaches that as long as he accepts upon himself not to engage in idol worship, he may remain in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 23:16 | “You shall not deliver to his master a slave” | Gittin 45a:9 | It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall not deliver to his master a slave”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16); <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The verse is speaking of one who acquires a slave in order to emancipate him. </b> The court may not deliver him to this master, because he is not his slave and he may not treat him as such. The Talmud asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> For example, <b>when he wrote to</b> the slave <b>like this: When I will purchase you, you are hereby acquired to yourself from now. </b> The new master does not take possession of the slave, as he is emancipated immediately upon being purchased. |
| Deuteronomy 23:16 | “You shall not deliver a slave to his master” | Kiddushin 63a:1 | With regard to the verse: <b>“You shall not deliver a slave to his master”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16), <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The verse is speaking of one who acquires a slave, </b> not to enslave him but <b>in order to emancipate him. </b> The court may not deliver the slave to this master, as this master has no right to enslave him. The Talmud asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: For example, if</b> the new master <b>wrote to</b> the slave in his bill of manumission: <b>When I will purchase you, you are hereby acquired to yourself from now. </b> In that case the slave acquires himself from that moment, despite the fact that the buyer does not own him. This shows that R' Yehuda HaNasi maintains that a person can transfer an item that has not yet entered the world, as one can emancipate his slave before acquiring him. |
| Deuteronomy 23:16 | “You shall not deliver a slave to his master” | Yevamot 93b:3 | With regard to <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, his opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall not deliver a slave to his master”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16). <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The verse is speaking of one who buys a slave on the condition to free him. </b> This owner may not keep his acquisition as a slave. The Talmud clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> It is referring to a case <b>where one wrote to</b> a slave in the document of acquisition: <b>When I acquire you</b> as a slave, <b>you are acquired by yourself from now. </b> In this case, the buyer transfers ownership of an entity not yet in the world, as the slave did not yet belong to him. |
| Deuteronomy 23:17 | “Where it is well for him; you shall not wrong him” | Arakhin 29a:18 | <b>Rav Beivai said: What is the reason? </b> It is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between <b>“well”</b> and <b>“well. ”</b> It is <b>written here, </b> with regard to a Hebrew slave, who can be sold only when the Jubilee Year is observed: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). <b>And</b> it is <b>written there, </b> with regard to a <i>ger toshav</i>: <b>“Where it is well for him; you shall not wrong him”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:17). The Talmud’s objection is that it is evident from the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to dedicated fields apply only when the Jubilee Year is observed. |
| Deuteronomy 23:17 | remedy? “He shall dwell with you in your midst” | Gittin 45a:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the residents of the Land of Canaan: <b>“They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you to sin against Me, </b> for you will serve their gods; for they will be a snare to you” (Exodus 23:33).

| Deuteronomy 23:18 | And it is stated below: “Neither shall there be a sodomite [ kadesh ] of the sons of Israel” | Chullin 115b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where</b> does he derive that meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>for benefit? </b> The Talmud responds: <b>He derives it from here, </b> as <b>it is stated here: “For you are a sacred [<i>kadosh</i>] people unto YHWH</b> your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “Neither shall there be a sodomite [<i>kadesh</i>] of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). The similar expressions teach that <b>just as below, </b> the prohibition of sodomy is a prohibition that involves enjoyment, i.e., deriving <b>benefit, </b> not eating, <b>so too here, </b> meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:18 | and from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” | Keritot 3a:14 | The Talmud suggests: <b>And if you would say</b> the entire Mishnah <b>is</b> in fact in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, and with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in <b>the first clause he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yishmael, </b> that is not tenable, as <b>doesn’t R' Abbahu say: </b> In the case of a male <b>who has sex with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to have sex, <b>according to</b> the statement of <b>R' Yishmael, who derives</b> these prohibitions <b>from two</b> separate <b>verses, from: “And you shall not lie with a man</b> as with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22), <b>and from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18), which is referring to one who engages in homosexual sex passively, one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. |
| Deuteronomy 23:18 | who brings an animal upon him | Keritot 3a:16 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Rather, the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yishmael, and with regard to</b> one who <b>blasphemes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Akiva. </b> The Talmud raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> two additional cases with regard to bestiality: <b>One who copulates with an animal, </b> derived from the verse: “And you shall not lie with any beast” (Leviticus 18:23); <b>and</b> a man <b>who brings an animal upon him</b> for bestiality, derived from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18), which can be interpreted as applying to all forms of male anal sex, including with animals. |
| Deuteronomy 23:18 | The verse states: “There shall not be a sodomite [ kadesh ] among the children of Israel” | Sanhedrin 54b:2 | <b>We have learned</b> from here the <b>prohibition for the one who engages in</b> homosexual <b>sex</b> actively. <b>From where</b> do we derive <b>the prohibition for one who engages in</b> homosexual <b>sex</b> passively? <b>The verse states: “There shall not be a sodomite [<i>kadesh</i>] among the children of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). <b>And</b> another verse, cited to clarify the meaning of the term <i>kadesh</i>, <b>states: “And there were also sodomites [<i>kadesh</i>] in the land, they did according to all the abominations of the nations which YHWH drove out</b> before the children of Israel” (I Kings 14:24). This is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael. </b> |

| Deuteronomy 23:19 | as it is written: “You shall not bring the payment to a prostitute or the price of a dog | Avodah Zarah46b:3 | <b>Rava says: </b> The dilemma can be resolved with <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.

| Deuteronomy 23:19 | prohibited | Bava Kamma65b:20 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one gave wheat</b> to a prostitute <b>for her payment, </b> i.e., the hire of her services, <b>and</b> she <b>made</b> the wheat into <b>flour; </b> or if he gave her <b>olives and</b> she <b>made them</b> into <b>oil; </b> or if he gave her <b>grapes and</b> she <b>made them</b> into <b>wine, it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to bring these products as an offering in the Temple, in accordance with the verse: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot…into the house of YHWH your God for any vow” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that these products are <b>permitted, </b> as the physical change renders them into new items. <b>And Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Guryon of Asporak teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai prohibit</b> these products <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> them. If so, these two <i>baraitot</i> reflect a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | As it is written: | Bava Kamma65b:21 | The Talmud clarifies the source of these two opinions. <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai</b> for prohibiting these products? <b>As it is written: </b> “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of YHWH your God for any vow; for even both of these are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The apparently superfluous word <b>“even”</b> serves <b>to include their changed</b> status. <b>And Beit Hillel, </b> who permit these items after they have undergone a physical change, maintain that the term <b>“these”</b> in the phrase “both of these” teaches that this prohibition applies only to the original items, <b>but not</b> to <b>their changed</b> form. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | payment | Bava Kamma70b:17 | <b>Rava said: Actually, </b> it is possible to explain the <b><i>baraita</i> as Rami bar Ḥama</b> did, that the animal was acquired through the picking of a fig on Shabbat. And the objection raised earlier, that this act should not be considered a sale at all, is incorrect. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the <b>Torah prohibits</b> one to bring as an offering an animal given as the <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And</b> this prohibition applies <b>even</b> if the man in question <b>had sex with his own mother, </b> which is a capital offense. <b>But if she</b> would bring <b>a legal claim before us, demanding</b> the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee, <b>would we say to him: Arise and pay her</b> the animal? The court would not say this, as the monetary liability was incurred simultaneously with the commission of a capital crime. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | prohibited | Bava Kamma93b:18 | <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Beit Shammai</b> maintain that an item that undergoes a change is considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>gave</b> a prostitute <b>wheat as her payment, and she</b> ground it and <b>converted it into flour; </b> or if he gave her <b>olives, and she</b> squeezed them and <b>converted them into oil; </b> or if he gave her <b>grapes, and she</b> squeezed them and <b>converted them into wine; </b> and if, in any of these cases, she subsequently consecrated the final product, <b>it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to sacrifice them upon the altar as a meal-offering or libation, as the Torah states: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>permitted, </b> as the Talmud will explain. <b>And Rav Yosef says: </b> It was <b>taught</b> by <b>Guryon</b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | even both of these | Bava Kamma94a:1 | <b>of Asporak: Beit Shammai prohibit</b> sacrificing these items <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. The Talmud clarifies: <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: </b> “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of YHWH your God for any vow; for <b>even both of these</b> are an abomination unto YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The word “even” is an amplification, which serves <b>to include</b> in the prohibition these items in <b>their changed</b> form. <b>And</b> what is the reason of <b>Beit Hillel? The verse states “these”</b> to emphasize that the prohibition applies only to these items in their initial form, <b>but not</b> in <b>their changed</b> form. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | payment | Bava Metzia91a:5 | <b>Rava said</b> that there is a difference between the transgression itself, which is between the offender and God, for which he is liable to be flogged, and the loss he caused the owner of the cow, for which he must pay restitution. The <b>Torah prohibits</b> one from bringing as an offering an animal given as the <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19); <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even</b> if the man in question <b>had sex with his own mother, </b> which is a capital offence. Although this man would certainly not be rendered liable to pay compensation by a court, as he is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, nevertheless, since he is technically liable to pay compensation, the money is subject to the prohibition as well. In this case too, despite the fact that the court cannot compel one to pay for the produce his cow ate, he does owe this sum. Furthermore, if the owner of the produce were to seize this sum from him, the court would not force him to return the money. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | “abomination” | Bekhorot 56b:4 | The Talmud clarifies Abaye’s opinion. An animal given to <b>a non-Jew prostitute</b> is considered <b>payment</b> to a prostitute, which is <b>prohibited</b> for sacrifice on the altar, as Abaye <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“abomination”</b> stated with regard to payment to a prostitute: “You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of YHWH your God for any vow, for both of these are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19), and the word <b>“abomination”</b> stated <b>in</b> the verses discussing <b>those with whom sex are forbidden: </b> “For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | in exchange for the dog is prohibited. | Bekhorot 57a:4 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> against the opinion that there is retroactive designation of the animals: <b>And similarly</b> in the case of two <b>partners who divided</b> their common property, and <b>one took ten</b> lambs <b>and</b> the other <b>one took nine</b> lambs <b>and a dog, </b> sacrificing any of the ten lambs taken <b>in exchange for the dog is prohibited. </b> This is because they are considered “the price of a dog,” as it states in the Torah (Deuteronomy 23:19), since they were given in exchange for it. Nevertheless, the nine lambs <b>that</b> were taken <b>with the dog are permitted</b> for sacrifice. The Talmud explains the objection: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation, </b> why are all ten lambs prohibited? <b>Let him select one of</b> the lambs <b>to correspond to the dog and take it</b> away, <b>and</b> all the rest of <b>these</b> lambs <b>should be permitted. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | for any vow” | Pesachim 90a:8 | However, if one gave her <b>birds</b> that were <b>non-sacred, they are prohibited</b> for use as an offering. The ruling concerning birds needs to be stated <b>as, by right, it should have been</b> permitted based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>What? If consecrated</b> animals, for <b>which a blemish disqualifies them</b> for use, may nevertheless be used as an offering, since the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment</b> or the status of a dog’s <b>price does not take effect upon them, </b> then with regard to <b>birds, </b> for <b>which a blemish does not disqualify them</b> for use as an offering, <b>is it not</b> logically <b>right that</b> the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment</b> or a dog’s <b>price should not take effect upon them? </b> In repudiation of this argument, <b>the verse states: </b> “You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of YHWH your God <b>for any vow”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:19). A derivation is made from the extraneous phrase “for any vow” <b>to include birds, </b> which may be brought as vows. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | as it is written: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, | Sotah 26b:10 | <b>Rava of Parzakya said to Rav Ashi: From where is this matter that the rabbis stated</b> derived, that <b>licentiousness does not</b> apply <b>with regard to an animal? </b> Rav Ashi replied that it is <b>as it is written: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, </b> into the house of YHWH your God for any vow; for both of them are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). This verse prohibits one from sacrificing an animal that served as payment to a prostitute or as payment for the purchase of a dog. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | it is written “prostitute,” | Temurah 29b:12 | <b>What is the reason</b> that payment to one’s menstruating wife is permitted? The reason is that <b>it is written “prostitute, ”</b> with regard to this prohibition: “You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute or the price of a dog into the House of YHWH your God, for both of them are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19), <b>and</b> this woman, his menstruating wife, <b>is not a prostitute. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | “abomination” | Temurah 29b:17 | The Talmud asks: <b>And Rav, this</b> word <b>“abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:19), from which Levi derives his ruling that an animal given by a husband for sex with his menstruating wife is considered payment to a prostitute, <b>what does he do with it? </b> The Talmud answers that Rav <b>requires this</b> word for <b>that which Abaye</b> said. <b>As Abaye said: </b> With regard to <b>a non-Jew prostitute, her payment is prohibited. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | is permitted, as it is stated: | Temurah 30a:8 | With regard to lambs given as <b>payment</b> to another for having sex with his <b>dog, or</b> as <b>the price of a prostitute</b> to purchase her as his female slave, <b>their</b> sacrifice <b>is permitted, as it is stated: </b> “As both of them are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19), from which it is inferred: <b>Two</b> are prohibited, payment to a prostitute and the price of a dog, <b>and not four, </b> i.e., the additional two cases of payment for sex with a dog and the price of a prostitute, which are permitted. Furthermore, with regard to the two prohibited cases of payment to a prostitute and the price of a dog, sacrifice of <b>their offspring is permitted, </b> as it is stated <b>“them, ” and not their offspring. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | the Sages taught: “The price of a dog” | Temurah 30a:9 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the definition of the price of a dog, <b>A baraita states: “The price of a dog”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:19), <b>this is</b> referring to an animal given in <b>exchange for a dog. </b> In this context the word “price” means an item given in exchange for another item, not money. <b>And likewise</b> the verse <b>states: “You sell Your people without wealth, and have not set their prices high”</b> (Psalms 44:13). The phrase “without wealth” indicates that the term “their prices” means an item given in exchange, rather than money. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | is permitted? As it is stated: | Temurah 30b:2 | The Talmud adds that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to the payment</b> of a lamb to another for having sex with <b>a dog, or</b> as <b>the price of a prostitute</b> to purchase her as his female slave, <b>that</b> their sacrifice <b>is permitted? As it is stated: </b> “For even both of them are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19), from which it is inferred: <b>Two</b> are prohibited, payment to a prostitute and the price of a dog, <b>and not four, </b> i.e., payment for sex with a dog and the price of a prostitute, which are permitted. Furthermore, sacrifice of <b>their offspring is permitted, as it is stated: “Even both of them, ”</b> which indicates that it is <b>“them”</b> that are forbidden, <b>and not their offspring. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | for any vow” | Temurah 30b:9 | If he paid her with non-sacred <b>birds, their</b> sacrifice <b>is prohibited. </b> The Mishnah elaborates: <b>As, by right, it should be</b> inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> items, <b>which a blemish disqualifies, </b> the prohibition of <b>payment</b> to a prostitute <b>and</b> the <b>price</b> of a dog <b>do not take effect with regard to them; </b> with regard to <b>a bird, which a blemish does not disqualify, is it not right that</b> the prohibition of <b>payment</b> to a prostitute <b>and</b> the <b>price</b> of a dog <b>should not take effect with regard to them? </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of YHWH your God <b>for any vow”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:19). This serves <b>to include the bird</b> in the prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | as it is written: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog | Yevamot 59b:8 | <b>Rava of Pirkin said to Rav Ashi: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>that the rabbis stated</b> that <b>there is no harlotry with regard to an animal? </b> Rav Ashi responded that it is <b>as it is written: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog</b> into the House of YHWH your God for any vow; for both of them are an abomination to YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). This verse prohibits one from sacrificing an animal as an offering if that animal was ever used to pay a harlot for her services, or if it was ever used as payment in the purchase of a dog. |
| Deuteronomy 23:19 | price | Zevachim 71a:1 | an ox <b>that</b> is known to have <b>killed a person based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on</b> the admission of <b>the owner. </b> Had two witnesses testified, deriving benefit from the ox would have been prohibited. Additional examples include when an offering is intermingled <b>with an animal that copulated with a person; or an animal that was the object of bestiality; </b> or <b>with</b> an animal that was <b>set aside</b> for idol worship; <b>or</b> one that <b>was worshipped</b> as a deity; or <b>with</b> an animal that was given as <b>payment</b> to a prostitute <b>or</b> as the <b>price</b> of a dog, as it is written: “You shall not bring the payment of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). |
| Deuteronomy 23:20 | neshekh of food, | Bava Metzia60b:19 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall not give him your money with <i>neshekh</i> and with <i>marbit</i> you shall not give him your food”</b> (Leviticus 25:37). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>neshekh</i> for</b> a loan of <b>money and</b> a prohibition of <b><i>ribit</i> for</b> a loan of <b>food. From where</b> is it derived that there is <b><i>neshekh</i> with regard to</b> a loan of <b>food</b> as well? The <i>baraita</i> answers: A different <b>verse states: </b> “You shall not lend with interest [<i>tashikh</i>] to your brother: <i>Neshekh</i> of money, <b><i>neshekh</i> of food, </b> <i>neshekh</i> of anything that is lent with interest [<i>asher yishakh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 23:20). The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that there is <b><i>ribit</i> with regard to</b> a loan of <b>money? The verse states: “<i>Neshekh</i> of money. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:20 | “ neshekh of anything that is lent for interest” | Bava Metzia61a:6 | The Talmud answers: <b>This</b> is what Ravina <b>is saying: Had</b> the <b>verse not stated</b> the terms <i>neshekh</i> and <i>tarbit</i> interposed between money and food, <b>I would have said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that both terms apply to both money and food would be derived by means of <b>a verbal analogy. Now, as</b> the <b>verse is stated</b> in that manner, <b>a verbal analogy is not necessary. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Rather, why do I</b> need this <b>verbal analogy? </b> The Talmud explains: I need the verbal analogy <b>to</b> teach that <b>“<i>neshekh</i> of anything that is lent for interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), <b>which is</b> written with regard to a borrower but <b>not written with regard to a lender, </b> applies to a lender as well. |
| Deuteronomy 23:20 | The verse states: “Interest of any matter [ davar ] that is lent with interest” | Bava Metzia75b:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to one who is owed one hundred dinars by another, and</b> the borrower <b>is not accustomed to greeting</b> that lender, <b>that it is prohibited to</b> start <b>greeting him</b> after being granted the loan? <b>The verse states: “Interest of any matter [<i>davar</i>] that is lent with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), which can also be read as indicating that <b>even speech [<i>dibbur</i>]</b> can be <b>prohibited</b> as interest. |
| Deuteronomy 23:20 | of: “You shall not lend to your brother with interest” | Bava Metzia75b:6 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And these</b> people <b>violate</b> the prohibition of interest. <b>Abaye says: </b> The <b>lender violates all of them, </b> meaning all of the prohibitions listed in the Mishnah. The <b>borrower violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not lend to your brother with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), as he enables his brother to lend with interest. And they also violate the prohibition: “You may lend to a non-Jew with interest, but <b>to your brother you shall not lend with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), as well as: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The <b>guarantor and the witness violate only: “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24). |
| Deuteronomy 23:21 | “Unto a gentile tashikh ” | Bava Metzia70b:10 | <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> Rav <b>Huna said to me</b> that this verse is <b>necessary only</b> to state <b>that even interest</b> that a Jew took <b>from a non-Jew</b> will ultimately reach the government treasury, and the one who took it will not be successful. <b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman: </b> The verse states: <b>“Unto a non-Jew <i>tashikh</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), which indicates that it is permitted for a Jew to take interest from a non-Jew, as <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>tashikh</i>”? Doesn’t</b> it mean the same as <b><i>tishokh</i>, </b> take interest, thereby teaching that one may take interest from a non-Jew? The Talmud refutes this claim: <b>No, </b> it means to <b>pay interest, </b> meaning that you must pay him interest. |
| Deuteronomy 23:21 | to your brother you shall not lend with interest” | Bava Metzia75b:6 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>And these</b> people <b>violate</b> the prohibition of interest. <b>Abaye says: </b> The <b>lender violates all of them, </b> meaning all of the prohibitions listed in the Mishnah. The <b>borrower violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “You shall not lend to your brother with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:20), as he enables his brother to lend with interest. And they also violate the prohibition: “You may lend to a non-Jew with interest, but <b>to your brother you shall not lend with interest”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:21), as well as: <b>“And you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The <b>guarantor and the witness violate only: “Do not place interest upon him”</b> (Exodus 22:24). |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | of: You shall not delay, | Arakhin 6a:14 | <b>Rather, </b> is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Charity</b> is like a vow to consecrate property, in that it <b>is</b> subject to the prohibition <b>of: You shall not delay, </b> which is derived from the verse: “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, you shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <b>But</b> nevertheless <b>it is not like consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> property it is <b>prohibited to use it, while</b> in the case of <b>charity</b> it is <b>permitted to use it. </b> Since with regard to the option of using the money the <i>baraita</i> does not distinguish between a case where one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity, and a case where he says: This <i>sela</i> is for charity, it evidently supports the opinion of Rava. |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | You must not delay. | Beitzah 19b:8 | <b>Abaye said: With regard to sacrificing</b> these offerings on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>everyone agrees that it is permitted. When they disagree, </b> it is not with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a Festival but with respect <b>to determining when one is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>You must not delay. </b> If one vows to bring an offering but fails to fulfill his pledge, how much time must pass before he transgresses the prohibition: “You shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22)? |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | will surely require it | Nedarim 4a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite vow, <b>derived from here, </b> i.e., the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship? <b>It is derived from there, </b> a different exposition based upon the verse: “When you shall take a vow…you shall not delay to pay it; for YHWH your God <b>will surely require it</b> of you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <b>Those</b> items included in the phrase “will surely require it” <b>are sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, </b> including the sin-offering and guilt-offering of a nazirite. |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | You shall not delay, | Rosh Hashanah4a:13 | The Talmud comments: This ruling makes <b>a practical difference to one who makes a vow, </b> in order <b>to determine when he is liable for</b> violating the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay. And</b> the Mishnah was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whether one makes a vow</b> to bring an offering to the Temple, <b>or consecrates</b> an item to the Temple, <b>or makes a valuation, </b> promising to pay the value of a particular person to the Temple treasury, <b>once three Festivals have passed</b> from that day and he has not yet fulfilled his promise, <b>he transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay, </b> as stated in the verse: “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22). |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | “When you shall vow a vow | Rosh Hashanah5b:2 | § The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters derived</b> that all the offerings and vows listed above in the <i>baraita</i> are subject to the prohibition against delaying? <b>As A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“When you shall vow a vow</b> to YHWH your God, you shall not delay paying it; for YHWH your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). From the words “when you shall vow a vow,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a vow-</b>offering, where one says: I undertake to bring an offering, thereby assuming personal responsibility to bring an offering, no matter what happens to any particular animal. But as for the case of <b>a gift-offering, </b> one says: I undertake to bring this animal as an offering. He assumes responsibility only to bring that particular animal, without assuming a general responsibility to bring an offering. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this, too, is included in the prohibition against delaying? |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | you shall not delay paying it; | Rosh Hashanah6a:2 | For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state</b> the word “it”? <b>Since</b> elsewhere <b>it states: </b> “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it; </b> for YHWH your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>I might have interpreted</b> from this verse that <b>even one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow</b> is included in: <b>It shall not be accepted. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “it. ” It, </b> an offering disqualified by improper intention [<i>piggul</i>], <b>is</b> included in the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted, ” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | “You shall not delay paying it” | Rosh Hashanah6a:6 | The Talmud clarifies the details mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: “That which is gone out of your lips”; this is a positive mitzva. Why do I</b> need this derivation? <b>Isn’t</b> the positive mitzva <b>derived</b> from the verse: <b>“And there you shall come; and there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the offering of your hand, and your vows, and your gift-offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6)? The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“You shall keep”; this is a prohibition. Why do I</b> need this derivation; <b>this is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“You shall not delay paying it”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22). |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | “When you shall vow a vow | Rosh Hashanah6b:12 | § <b>R' Zeira asks: </b> In the case of <b>an heir, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of: <b>You shall not delay? </b> That is to say, does an heir transgress the prohibition against delaying a vow taken by his father? The Talmud explains the two sides of the question: Is it that <b>God states</b> in the Torah: <b>“When you shall vow a vow</b> to YHWH your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>and this</b> one, the heir, <b>did not make a vow? Or perhaps</b> the essence of the mitzva is as it says: <b>“And there you shall come; and there you shall bring</b> your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6), <b>and this</b> one, the heir, <b>is obligated</b> to come and bring his father’s offerings. |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | from you” | Rosh Hashanah6b:13 | <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this, <b>as R' Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that says: The verse states: “For YHWH your God will surely require it <b>from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22), which is interpreted to mean: <b>To the exclusion of an heir. </b> This teaches that an heir does not transgress the prohibition against delaying a vow taken by his father. |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | of: You shall not delay, | Temurah 18b:7 | Since the term <i>ḥag</i> generally refers to <i>Sukkot</i>, the Talmud asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals that <b>once one pilgrimage Festival has passed</b> from when they were consecrated, and the owner has not yet brought them to the Temple, <b>each day he transgresses with regard to them</b> the prohibition <b>of: You shall not delay, </b> which is derived from the verse that states: “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, you shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), already <b>from <i>Shavuot</i> he must eat</b> the offspring of the peace offering that was sacrificed on Passover. Why then did they wait until <i>Sukkot</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: </b> It is referring to a case where the owner was unable to sacrifice the offspring of the peace offering on <i>Shavuot</i> due to circumstances beyond his control, <b>for example, </b> if the animal <b>was ill on <i>Shavuot</i></b> [<b><i>ba’Atzeret</i></b>]<b>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | you shall not delay paying it; | Zevachim 29a:11 | <b>Ben Azzai says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “It”? </b> It is necessary <b>because</b> elsewhere <b>it is stated: </b> “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it; </b> for YHWH your God will require it from you, and it will be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> one who <b>is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow</b> is included <b>in: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It, ”</b> to indicate that <b>it, </b> an offering rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted, ” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:22 | and it will be sin in you” | Zevachim 29b:4 | The Talmud asks further: <b>But still, </b> isn’t this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>elsewhere: </b> The verse states: “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, you shall not delay paying it; for YHWH your God will require it from you; <b>and it will be sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22), indicating that there is sin in you, <b>but</b> there is <b>no sin in your offering, </b> and therefore it is not disqualified due to the delay? |
| Deuteronomy 23:23 | ab initio ? But it is written: “And if you shall cease to vow, there shall be no sin in you” | Chullin 2a:5 | Rav Aḥa challenges: <b>But</b> a Mishnah teaches (<i>Arakhin</i> 2a): <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation</b> and is thereby obligated to donate to the Temple treasury the value fixed by the Torah based on the age and gender of the person valuated; <b>and</b> everyone <b>is valuated, </b> and therefore one who vowed to donate his fixed value is obligated to pay; everyone <b>vows</b> to donate the market value of a person as a slave to the Temple treasury and is thereby obligated to pay; <b>and</b> everyone is the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his market value. Is that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But it is written: “And if you shall cease to vow, there shall be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23), indicating that it is preferable not to vow. |
| Deuteronomy 23:23 | “But if you refrain [ teḥdal ] from vowing there will be no sin in you” | Nedarim 22a:7 | <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we also do not broach</b> dissolution <b>with this</b> statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: </b> With regard to one who vows, <b>although he fulfills it, he is called wicked. R' Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is <b>“But if you refrain [<i>teḥdal</i>] from vowing there will be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23), <b>and he derives</b> the word <b><i>ḥadala</i></b> here from the word <b><i>ḥadala</i></b> elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “But if you refrain [<i>teḥdal</i>] from vowing, ” and it is written there: “There the wicked cease [<i>ḥadlu</i>] from troubling”</b> (Job 3:17). The parallel language demonstrates that vowing is an act of the wicked. |
| Deuteronomy 23:23 | “But if you refrain to vow, it will be no sin in you” | Nedarim 77b:4 | <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Master, see that Sage who came from the West, </b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> who <b>said: The rabbis attended to</b> the dissolution of a vow taken by <b>the son of Rav Huna bar Avin, and they dissolved his vow and said to him: Go and request mercy for yourself, for you have sinned</b> by taking a vow. <b>As Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra teaches: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who takes a vow, even if he fulfills it, he is called a sinner. Rav Zevid said: What verse</b> teaches this? It is: <b>“But if you refrain to vow, it will be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23). It may be inferred <b>that</b> if <b>you did not refrain</b> from taking vows, <b>there is sin. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | according to what you have vowed | Menachot 103a:2 | The reason for this is that the Torah states: “That which has emerged from your lips you shall observe and do; <b>according to what you have vowed</b> freely to YHWH your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). Since it states: “According to what you have vowed,” <b>and not: According to what you have designated</b> to fulfill your vow, only matters specified as part of the vow are essential to its content. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | And if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed as a gift offering to the Lord your God, | Menachot 2a:7 | <b>And if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed as a gift offering to YHWH your God, </b> that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Talmud analyzes the verse: Is it <b>a gift</b> offering? <b>It is a vow</b> offering. Why does the verse first <b>call it a vow</b> offering <b>and</b> subsequently <b>call it a gift</b> offering? <b>Rather, </b> the verse teaches that <b>if you acted in accordance with how you vowed, </b> i.e., if you sacrificed the offering for its own sake, your obligation to fulfill your <b>vow will be</b> fulfilled; <b>but if</b> you did <b>not</b> act in accordance with your vow, it does not fulfill the obligation incurred by the vow, and <b>will be</b> considered <b>a gift</b> offering. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do” | Menachot 50a:19 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> contrary to those two inferences: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may voluntarily donate and bring</b> incense <b>similar to</b> the incense brought by the tribal princes to the Temple as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this incense, as in the case of other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:24). Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the inner altar: <b>“You shall bring no strange incense thereon”</b> (Exodus 30:9). This indicates that an individual may not sacrifice incense even on the inner altar. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; | Menachot 58a:2 | The Talmud answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may donate and bring</b> to the Temple <b>a gift</b> offering <b>similar to those</b> two loaves brought by the community, <b>and</b> in support <b>I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this offering the verse that deals with other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; </b> according to what you have vowed freely to YHWH your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24), which would mean that the offering is consecrated and he must bring it as he declared. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | with your mouth” | Nedarim 7a:3 | The Talmud explains the two sides of this dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> charity is <b>juxtaposed to offerings, as it is written</b> in a verse following the prohibition against delaying an offering: “That you have spoken <b>with your mouth”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:24) and the rabbis expounded that <b>this is</b> a reference to <b>charity, </b> therefore, <b>just as there is intimation, </b> i.e., intimation is effective, <b>with regard to offerings, so too, there is intimation with regard to charity? Or perhaps</b> it is only with regard to the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay, that it is juxtaposed, </b> but not with regard to other <i>halakhot</i>? |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | The Sages taught | Rosh Hashanah6a:5 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and do; as you have vowed as a gift to YHWH your God, which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). <b>“That which is gone out of your lips”; this is a positive mitzva. “You shall keep”; this is a prohibition, </b> as the phrase “you shall keep” is a warning to keep oneself from sinning. <b>“And do”; </b> this is <b>an admonition to the court to make you</b> fulfill your vow. <b>“As you have vowed”; this</b> is referring to <b>a vow-offering. “To YHWH your God”; this</b> is referring to <b>sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings, </b> teaching that one must keep his word and bring them. “As a <b>gift”; </b> this is understood <b>in its literal sense</b> to be referring to a gift-offering. <b>“Which you have promised”; this</b> is referring to <b>objects consecrated for Temple maintenance. “With your mouth”; this</b> is referring to vows of <b>charity, </b> to which one commits himself with his mouth. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | “That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; | Shevuot 26b:15 | The Talmud <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; </b> according as you have vowed freely to YHWH your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case in <b>which he expresses with his lips. From where</b> do I derive a case where <b>he decided</b> only <b>in his heart? The verse states</b> in the context of the contributions to the building of the Tabernacle: “And they came, both men and women, <b>as many as were willinghearted, </b> and brought nose rings, and earrings, and signet rings, and girdles, all jewels of gold” (Exodus 35:22). The fact that the verse describes those who contributed as willinghearted indicates that one becomes liable via a non-verbal decision. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [ nadarta ] freely [ nedava ] to the Lord your God, | Zevachim 2a:10 | And <b>if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [<i>nadarta</i>] freely [<i>nedava</i>] to YHWH your God, </b> even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Talmud interprets the words <i>nadarta</i> and <i>nedava</i> exegetically: Can <b>this</b> verse be referring to <b>a gift</b> offering [<b><i>nedava</i></b>]? |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | The verse states: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [ nadarta ] | Zevachim 4b:27 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [<i>nadarta</i>]</b> freely [<i>nedava</i>] to YHWH your God, that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Talmud interprets the words <i>nadarta</i> and <i>nedava</i> exegetically: How can the offering mentioned in <b>this</b> verse be <b>a gift</b> offering <b>[<i>nedava</i>]? It is</b> already referred to as <b>a vow</b> offering <b>[<i>neder</i>]. Rather, </b> the verse indicates that <b>if you did what you had vowed</b> to do, i.e., sacrificed your vow offering properly, <b>it shall be</b> a satisfactory <b>vow</b> offering; <b>but if</b> you did <b>not</b> sacrifice it properly, <b>it shall be</b> rendered a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering. Although it does not satisfy the obligation of your vow, it remains a valid offering. |
| Deuteronomy 23:24 | If you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe | Zevachim 7b:3 | Why is this so? <b>If you wish, cite a verse; </b> and <b>if you wish, propose a logical argument. </b> The Talmud elaborates: <b>If you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe</b> and do; according to what you have vowed freely to YHWH your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The derivation from this verse was explained in 2a. <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument: </b> Just <b>because</b> one <b>deviated</b> from protocol <b>in its</b> slaughter, shall he continue to deviate from protocol in the rest of the sacrificial process? This is <b>as</b> it was stated at <b>the beginning of the chapter</b> (2a). |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | “But you may not put any in your vessel” | Bava Metzia87b:13 | The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, with regard to when a laborer may eat, <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“But you may not put any in your vessel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25), as the Talmud will explain later. Therefore, the word “sickle” is not required to teach that <i>halakha</i> and can be used as the source of the <i>halakha</i> that a laborer may eat all kinds of produce that are cut with a sickle, as stated by Shmuel. The Talmud asks: Shmuel’s derivation <b>works out well</b> for any type of produce <b>that requires a sickle</b> for its harvest. But <b>from where do we</b> derive that the same applies to a type of produce <b>that does not require a sickle</b> for its harvest? |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, | Bava Metzia87b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>And now that</b> we <b>have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning which produce a laborer is entitled to eat both <b>from</b> the mention of <b>“sickle” and from “standing, ” why do I</b> need the earlier verse: <b>“When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, </b> then you may eat grapes until you have enough at your own pleasure; but you may not put any in your vessel” (Deuteronomy 23:25)? |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat | Bava Metzia87b:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that a laborer may eat from produce attached to the ground, derived? The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat</b> grapes until you have enough at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel” (Deuteronomy 23:25). The Talmud asks: <b>We find</b> a source for <b>a vineyard; from where do we</b> derive that a laborer may likewise eat from <b>any</b> other <b>type</b> of produce? |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, | Bava Metzia88b:13 | <b>R' Ami stated</b> an alternative answer: <b>A verse is not required</b> to teach the right of <b>a person</b> to eat <b>from detached</b> produce, as <b>it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, </b> then you may eat grapes” (Deuteronomy 23:25). <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case in <b>which</b> the employer <b>hired</b> the laborer <b>to transport</b> the grapes out of the vineyard, <b>and</b> yet <b>God states</b> that <b>he may eat? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard” | Bava Metzia89a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this exposition? This <i>halakha</i> can be <b>derived from</b> the words in the verse: <b>“When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25), as these actions are not performed in a vineyard. The Talmud answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> God <b>writes: “Standing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), and, as explained earlier, this serves <b>to include all items that stand, </b> i.e., produce of all kinds, one might have thought that it <b>also</b> serves <b>to include items that are not grown from the ground. </b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to food that grows from the ground. |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | derived from: “But you shall not put any in your vessel” | Bava Metzia89a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this exposition? It can be <b>derived from: “But you shall not put any in your vessel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25), which indicates that if the laborer does not place the food into the owner’s vessels, he is not permitted to eat. The Talmud answers: <b>No, </b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>Even though he</b> also <b>plucks</b> and removes <b>the small ones from between the thick ones, </b> and therefore the work of the small garlic and onions has been completed, nevertheless, the laborer may not eat from them, as this is not the completion of the work of the entire field. |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard” | Bava Metzia91b:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling of the Rabbis stated in the first clause of the Mishnah? The Talmud explains that the verse states: <b>“When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25). Since the Torah does not specify a particular kind of task, it is understood as referring <b>to any</b> labor <b>he performs. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | at your own pleasure [ kenafshekha ]” | Bava Metzia92a:15 | The Talmud rejects this suggestion: <b>No; </b> it is possible <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>he eats from his own</b> property, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of a term in the verse: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat grapes until you have enough <b>at your own pleasure [<i>kenafshekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25). One <b>Sage, </b> R' Elazar, <b>holds that “at your own pleasure [<i>kenafshekha</i>], ”</b> which literally means: In accordance with your soul, is referring <b>to a matter for which he hands over his soul, </b> i.e., the laborer acquires the fruit by virtue of the risks he accepts upon himself as part of his work. |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | to my wife and my children, that they do not listen to him? As it is stated: “But you shall not put any in your vessel” | Bava Metzia92a:19 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a laborer who said: Give</b> the produce <b>to my wife and my children, that they do not listen to him? As it is stated: “But you shall not put any in your vessel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25). <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>so too, </b> this is referring to <b>a nazirite, if so, </b> the reason is not <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“But you shall not put any in your vessel”; </b> rather, <b>it is due to</b> the principle: <b>Go, go, we say to a nazirite, </b> do not approach a vineyard. |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard | Bava Metzia92a:8 | The Talmud returns to the dispute of the Mishnah: <b>If you wish, say that the</b> practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of the first <i>tanna</i> and the Rabbis concerns a <i>halakha</i> taught <b>by Rav. As Rav says: I found a concealed scroll, </b> a document that lists <i>halakhot</i> in shortened form so that they will not be forgotten. Rav discovered this document <b>in R' Ḥiyya’s house, and it was written in it: Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that with regard to the verse: <b>“When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard</b> then you may eat grapes until you have enough at your own pleasure” (Deuteronomy 23:25), <b>the verse is speaking of the entry of any person</b> who passes alongside a vineyard, not only a laborer. |
| Deuteronomy 23:25 | may not eat from | Meilah 13a:12 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>the laborers</b> of Temple produce <b>may not eat from</b> consecrated dried figs, and likewise a cow may not eat from consecrated vetch. The Talmud does not ask about the source of the <i>halakha</i> of a laborer, as the verse clearly states in this regard: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard” (Deuteronomy 23:25), which does not include a vineyard belonging to the Temple; but the Talmud does ask about the case of the cow: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling with regard to a cow? <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami said: As the verse states: “Do not muzzle the ox during its treading”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4). The term <b>“its treading”</b> teaches that this prohibition applies to muzzling an ox when it is treading <b>your</b> non-sacred field, <b>and not</b> when it is <b>treading a consecrated</b> field. Since the consecrated produce is prohibited, one must muzzle the ox. |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | a sickle” | Bava Metzia87b:11 | The Talmud resumes its discussion: <b>In any case, </b> it is <b>difficult, </b> as there still has not been found a source according to which the <i>halakha</i> that a laborer may eat when he is working applies to all types of produce. <b>Rather, Shmuel said: The verse states</b> with regard to a laborer who may eat produce: <b>“But</b> you shall not move <b>a sickle”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26). This serves <b>to include all</b> types of produce <b>that are</b> cut <b>with a sickle. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | The verse states: “Standing [ kama ]” | Bava Metzia87b:14 | <b>Rather, R' Yitzḥak said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning which produce a laborer may eat is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states: “Standing [<i>kama</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), and the unmodified term <i>kama</i> serves <b>to include any standing</b> produce. The Talmud asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> earlier that the term <b>standing</b> is referring specifically to <b>standing</b> produce <b>whose</b> owner is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, </b> and not to other produce? |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck ears with your hand; | Bava Metzia87b:4 | The Talmud challenges this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a vineyard? </b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the owner of a vineyard is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>olelot</i>, </b> the obligation to leave incomplete clusters of grapes for the poor (see Leviticus 19:10). Accordingly, one should not be able to derive the <i>halakha</i> of other types of produce from the <i>halakha</i> of a vineyard. The Talmud explains: <b>We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a laborer may eat from other crops <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he may eat <b>standing</b> grain. The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that he may eat <b>standing</b> grain <b>itself? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck ears with your hand; </b> but you shall not move a sickle on to your neighbor’s standing grain” (Deuteronomy 23:26). |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | It is written here: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain” | Bava Metzia87b:6 | The Talmud answers: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“standing”</b> written here and the term <b>“standing”</b> written elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), <b>and it is written there, </b> with regard to harvesting the barley for the <i>omer</i> offering: “Seven weeks you shall count for yourself; <b>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:9). <b>Just as there, </b> in the verse referring to the harvesting of the <i>omer</i>, it is the owner of <b>standing</b> grain <b>who is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, </b> as barley is one of the five grains, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to a laborer, it is discussing <b>standing</b> grain <b>whose</b> owner <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | “standing,” “standing” twice: | Bava Metzia88b:12 | After refuting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the Talmud inquires: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that <b>a person</b> may eat <b>from detached</b> produce? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> the term <b>“standing, ” “standing” twice: </b> “When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain…but you shall not move a sickle on your neighbor’s standing grain” (Deuteronomy 23:26). <b>If</b> the second expression is <b>not</b> applied to the <b>matter of</b> the right of <b>a person</b> to eat <b>from attached</b> produce, as that <i>halakha</i> has been derived from the first mention of “standing,” <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> the right of <b>a person</b> to eat <b>from detached</b> produce. |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | “your neighbor,” “your neighbor” twice | Bava Metzia88b:16 | The Talmud rejects this suggestion: This cannot be the case, as <b>the verse states: “And your brother shall live with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:36), which indicates that the mitzva to provide sustenance applies only to <b>your brother, but not</b> to <b>an ox. </b> After refuting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the Talmud inquires: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that <b>an ox</b> must be allowed to eat <b>from attached</b> produce? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> the term <b>“your neighbor, ” “your neighbor” twice</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26). <b>If</b> the second expression <b>is not</b> applied to the <b>matter of</b> the right of <b>a person</b> to eat <b>from attached</b> produce, as that <i>halakha</i> has been derived from the first mention of “your neighbor,” <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of an ox, </b> that it must be allowed to eat <b>from attached</b> produce. |
| Deuteronomy 23:26 | writes: “Standing” | Bava Metzia89a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this exposition? This <i>halakha</i> can be <b>derived from</b> the words in the verse: <b>“When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:25), as these actions are not performed in a vineyard. The Talmud answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> God <b>writes: “Standing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:26), and, as explained earlier, this serves <b>to include all items that stand, </b> i.e., produce of all kinds, one might have thought that it <b>also</b> serves <b>to include items that are not grown from the ground. </b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to food that grows from the ground. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | and give | Bava Batra168a:4 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>the husband gives</b> the scribe’s <b>wages</b> for writing a bill of divorce. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Talmud answers: <b>As the verse states: </b> “When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter in her, <b>he shall write</b> her a scroll of severance <b>and give</b> it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). It is therefore the husband’s responsibility to have the bill of divorce written. The Talmud adds: <b>But today, </b> the reason <b>that we do not do so, </b> but instead have the woman pay the scribe, is that <b>the rabbis placed</b> the burden <b>upon the woman, so that</b> the husband <b>should not delay</b> the divorce by refusing to pay the scribe. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | in her hand” | Bava Metzia10b:17 | The Talmud asks about the explanation of the opinion of Abba Kohen Bardela: <b>But is there anyone who says</b> that placing an item in <b>a courtyard is not included</b> as a valid means of acquisition <b>due to</b> the fact that it acts as <b>her hand? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: “And he writes her a scroll of severance, and he gives it <b>in her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a woman is divorced if her husband places the bill of divorce in <b>her hand. From where</b> is it derived that even if he places it on <b>her roof, </b> in <b>her courtyard, or in her enclosure, </b> she is divorced? <b>The verse states: “And he gives, ”</b> indicating that she is divorced <b>in any case. </b> Apparently one’s courtyard is considered an extension of his hand with regard to acquiring property, in this case, the bill of divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And place it in her hand” | Bava Metzia56b:6 | The Talmud infers: The <i>halakha</i> applies if the stolen item is found in his possession, and this includes any place in his possession. <b>The reason</b> is that <b>God writes: “If the theft is found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>]. ”</b> If <b>that</b> were <b>not so, I would say</b> that <b>wherever He writes “his hand, ”</b> the reference <b>is</b> to <b>his actual hand. And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written with regard to a bill of divorce: <b>“And place it in her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only her hand; from where</b> do I derive that the <i>halakha</i> is the same if he places the bill of divorce on <b>her roof, </b> in <b>her courtyard, or</b> in <b>her enclosure? The verse states: And place, in any case</b> that he places it in her possession. Here too, the Talmud infers: <b>The reason</b> that any place in her possession is included is that <b>God writes “and place. ”</b> If <b>that</b> were <b>not so, I would say</b> that <b>wherever He writes “his hand, ”</b> the reference <b>is</b> to <b>his actual hand. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | it is written: “And he shall write for her” | Eruvin 13b:2 | The Talmud rejects this argument: <b>How can you compare</b> the two cases? <b>There, </b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>it is written: “And he shall write for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), and therefore <b>we require writing</b> it <b>in her name, </b> specifically for her; whereas <b>here, </b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>it is written: “And he shall perform with her</b> all this ritual” (Numbers 5:30), and therefore <b>we require performance in her name. </b> In <b>her</b> case, the <b>performance is erasure; </b> however, writing of the scroll need not be performed specifically for her. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | a scroll | Eruvin 15b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for R' Yosei HaGelili’s</b> opinion? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her; that he write her <b>a scroll</b> of severance and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1): From the word scroll, <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only a scroll</b> is valid. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include all objects</b> as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The Torah states: “That he write her, ” in any case, </b> i.e., any surface upon which the formula can be written. <b>If so, why does the verse state “scroll”? To tell you</b> that a bill of divorce must be written on a surface like a scroll: <b>Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too, </b> a bill of divorce may be written on <b>any object that is neither alive nor food. </b> That is why R' Yosei HaGelili invalidates a bill of divorce written on a living being. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | that there are in | Gittin 20a:1 | <b>If</b> there is a concern that the Torah scroll can effect a divorce <b>due to</b> the verses concerning <b>severance</b> of marriage <b>that there are in</b> it, as it is written: “And he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), this is also not problematic, since <b>it is required, </b> as it states: <b>“And he writes her. ”</b> This indicates that the bill of divorce must be written <b>for her sake, </b> i.e., it must be written for the express intent of being used to effect divorce between this specific man and this specific woman, <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> so in the case of a Torah scroll. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And he writes | Gittin 20a:7 | § <b>Rav Ḥisda said: I am able to invalidate all the bills of divorce in the world. </b> Most bills of divorce are written in a way that they could be declared invalid. If one were to be particular about certain details, then there would be no valid bills of divorce. <b>Rava said to him: What is the reason</b> that you could invalidate them? <b>If we say: </b> Most bills of divorce are invalid <b>because it is written</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he writes</b> her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and here, </b> in the case of most bills of divorce, <b>she writes</b> it <b>for him, </b> as it is customary for a woman to pay a scribe to write the bill of divorce, <b>but</b> then <b>perhaps</b> it could be maintained that <b>the rabbis transferred</b> the ownership of the bill of divorce <b>to him, </b> and it is considered as if he wrote it. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | because it is written: “And gives” | Gittin 20a:8 | <b>But rather, </b> you might say that it is <b>because it is written: “And gives”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), which is usually understood to mean that the item given must have some monetary value, <b>and here</b> in the case of most bills of divorce <b>he doesn’t give her anything</b> of value. <b>Perhaps the</b> mere <b>giving of the bill of divorce is</b> the giving mentioned in the Torah, even if it does not have any monetary value. <b>Know</b> that it is not a requirement that the bill of divorce have monetary value, as the rabbis <b>sent</b> this message <b>from there, </b> from Eretz Yisrael: If <b>he wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>on items from which benefit is forbidden, </b> then although the bill of divorce is completely lacking monetary value, the bill of divorce is <b>valid. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | one scroll | Gittin 20b:9 | The Talmud asks: Why isn’t a solution offered for Rav Pappa’s question? <b>Let him derive</b> an answer to this question from elsewhere, as <b>God speaks</b> of <b>one scroll</b> in regard to the bill of divorce in the Torah: “And he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and not two or three scrolls. </b> If the woman receives only the paper on which the words are written but the rest of the paper belongs to the man, then this is not viewed as a single scroll. Rather, it is multiple scrolls, thereby invalidating it. The Talmud answers: <b>No, </b> it is <b>necessary</b> to discuss the question in a case where the letters are <b>intertwined, </b> meaning that they were written in such a manner that even if the paper between them was removed, the writing in the bill of divorce would remain attached as a single entity. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And sends her out [ veshilleḥa ]” | Gittin 21a:12 | <b>And Abaye</b> would respond: <b>Is that to say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency is included from</b> the words <b>“her hand”? </b> It is not learned from there; rather, it <b>is included</b> based on the additional wording of the verse, as the verse does not state: <b>And he sent [<i>veshillaḥ</i>]. </b> Rather, it states: <b>“And sends her out [<i>veshilleḥa</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). The expanded term teaches that a woman can also appoint an agent to receive a bill of divorce on her behalf. Since agency has a different source in the Torah, it is not impacted by the limitations of her hand. The <i>halakha</i> that a bill of divorce can be given to her by placing it in her courtyard is an extension of the <i>halakha</i> that it can be placed in her hand and does carry the limitations of her hand. Therefore, it must be able to work whether with her consent or against her will. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | her hand” | Gittin 21a:9 | <b>Abaye said</b> as a challenge to Rava: <b>Now, from where was a courtyard included? </b> What is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that a man can divorce a woman by placing a bill of divorce in her courtyard? This can be derived <b>from</b> the phrase: “And gives it in <b>her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), and the rabbis derived that this is not limited to her actual hand but also includes anything that is an extension of her hand, such as her courtyard. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | effect | Gittin 21b:13 | <b>And so R' Elazar says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: And this is</b> a case <b>where he left a place for the essential</b> part of the document. <b>And so Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: And this is when he left a place for the essential</b> part of the document. <b>And</b> all these rabbis hold that the Mishnah <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Elazar, who says: Witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce. It is not the signatures of the witnesses on a bill of divorce that validate it. Rather, the divorce is effected by the transmission of the document in the presence of witnesses. Therefore, the phrase: “And he writes” (Deuteronomy 24:1), must be referring to the writing of the bill of divorce and not to the signing of the witnesses, and the restrictions derived from this verse will apply to the writing of the bill of divorce, so the essential part may not be written on something that is attached to the ground. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | her | Gittin 21b:2 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And he writes</b> her a scroll of severance, <b>and gives it</b> in <b>her</b> hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1), meaning that <b>something</b> is valid as a bill of divorce <b>when it is lacking only writing and giving, excluding this, </b> a cow’s horn, <b>which is lacking writing, cutting, and giving. </b> Since the additional step of cutting would be required in order for him to give her the horn alone, the horn would not be a valid bill of divorce, so he must give her the cow. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | a scroll | Gittin 21b:3 | § The Mishnah taught that <b>R' Yosei HaGelili says</b> that a bill of divorce may not be written on something living, nor on food. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason for R' Yosei HaGelili’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is said in the Torah with regard to a bill of divorce: “And he writes her <b>a scroll</b> of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1). From the word “scroll,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a scroll</b> is valid; <b>from where</b> do I derive that it is correct <b>to include all objects</b> as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The verse states: “And he writes her, ” in any case, </b> i.e., a bill of divorce can be written on any type of surface. <b>If so, what is</b> the meaning when <b>the verse states “scroll”? </b> This teaches: <b>Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too, </b> a bill of divorce may be written on <b>any object that is neither alive nor food. </b> This is why R' Yosei HaGelili deems invalid a bill of divorce written on a living being. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | effect | Gittin 23a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a non-Jew is disqualified</b> from writing a bill of divorce? The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Elazar, who says: Witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce, and when the verse states: “And he writes her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), which is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that the writing needs to be done for her sake, it is referring to the writing of the bill of divorce and not to its signing. Therefore, <b>we need</b> the <b>writing</b> to be <b>for her sake, and certainly a non-Jew acts</b> based on <b>his own will</b> and may not be relied upon to write the bill of divorce according to the instructions of a supervisor. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | What is the reason | Gittin 24b:7 | The Talmud explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that a bill of divorce must be written for the sake of the woman who is being divorced? It is stated in the verse that deals with divorce: “And he writes for her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This teaches the following: <b>If</b> God had <b>written</b> only: <b>And he gives a scroll of severance in her hand, I would say</b> that the verse serves <b>to exclude this</b> case of the <b>first</b> clause of the Mishnah, <b>where it was done not for the sake of severance, </b> as the scribe wrote the bill of divorce as a mere exercise; <b>however, </b> if one <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>to divorce his wife but</b> then <b>reconsidered, where</b> it was <b>done for the sake of severance, </b> I would <b>say</b> that it is <b>valid</b> for another man to use for divorcing his wife. Therefore, <b>God writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he writes, ”</b> meaning that the bill of divorce must be written exclusively for the sake of his own divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And he writes for her” | Gittin 26a:16 | The Mishnah teaches that R' Elazar invalidates bills of divorce when the standard part of the document was written in advance, <b>as it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he writes for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), which teaches that it must be written for her sake. The Talmud asks: <b>But when it is written: </b> “And he writes <b>for her, ”</b> it is <b>about</b> the <b>essential</b> part of a document <b>that it is written, </b> and not about the standard part. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And he writes for her” | Gittin 26a:7 | <b>R' Yehuda invalidates all of</b> these documents if their standard parts were written in advance. <b>R' Elazar deems all of them valid except for bills of divorce, as it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he writes for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), indicating that he must write the bill of divorce <b>for her sake. </b> Therefore, one may not write even the standard part of the bill of divorce in advance, as that would not qualify as writing the bill of divorce for her sake. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | it states: “And he writes her a scroll of severance” | Gittin 41b:14 | The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she can be partially redeemed <b>via money. From where</b> do I derive that she can also be emancipated <b>via a bill</b> of manumission? <b>The verse states: “And not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given to her”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), <b>and later on, </b> in the case of divorce, <b>it states: “And he writes her a scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>Just as later on</b> freedom is granted <b>via a bill</b> of divorce, <b>so too here, </b> a female slave is freed <b>via a bill</b> of manumission. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | a woman: | Gittin 41b:5 | <b>And the Rabbis derive</b> their opinion, that a slave cannot acquire half of his freedom via a bill of manumission, <b>from</b> a verbal analogy of the word <b>“her [<i>lah</i>]”</b> written here: “Nor was freedom given to her [<i>lah</i>]” (Leviticus 19:20), and the word <b>“her [<i>lah</i>]”</b> written with regard to a man who divorces <b>a woman: </b> “And he writes her [<i>lah</i>] a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a woman, </b> one is <b>not</b> able to divorce <b>half of her</b> with a bill of divorce, <b>so too, </b> in the case of <b>a slave, </b> one is <b>not</b> able to emancipate <b>half of him</b> with a bill of manumission. <b>However, with regard to</b> a slave who frees himself by giving <b>money, everyone agrees that</b> the slave <b>acquires</b> half of himself, and a female slave would also be partially <b>redeemed but not</b> fully <b>redeemed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And gives it in her hand” | Gittin 77a:11 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the basis for the <i>halakha</i> that when the husband throws the bill of divorce into his wife’s house or courtyard, the divorce takes effect? The Talmud answers: It is <b>as A baraita states: </b> The verse states with regard to a bill of divorce: <b>“And gives it in her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), from which <b>I have</b> derived that she is divorced <b>only</b> if he actually places it in <b>her hand. </b> But <b>from where</b> do I derive that she is divorced even if he places it on <b>her roof, </b> in <b>her courtyard, or</b> in <b>her enclosure? The verse states: “And gives it, ”</b> indicating that she is divorced <b>in any case, </b> regardless of the manner in which he gives her the bill of divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And gives it in her hand” | Gittin 78a:16 | The Talmud challenges this: If <b>she pulled it out, </b> it is <b>also</b> not a valid bill of divorce, since it is <b>required</b> that the directive: <b>“And gives it in her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), be fulfilled, <b>and</b> in this case <b>it is not</b> fulfilled, since he did not give it to her; rather, she took it. The Talmud answers: <b>No, </b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he bent</b> [<b><i>da’arak</i></b>] <b>his waist</b> over toward her <b>and she pulled it out, </b> and by extending his waist to her, it is as though he gave the bill of divorce to her. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | And the Torah said: “And he writes her” | Gittin 87a:6 | <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </b> According <b>to Reish Lakish, who says</b> that if the divorce of each couple is mentioned separately, then even if <b>one date</b> was written <b>for all of them it is still</b> considered a separate <b>formula, and</b> he explains that <b>what are the circumstances of</b> the case of <b>a general wording; </b> a case <b>where the following</b> wording <b>is written in</b> the bill of divorce: <b>We, so-and-so and so-and-so, have</b> hereby <b>divorced our wives so-and-so and so-and-so. </b> Accordingly, <b>two women are found being divorced with one bill of divorce. </b> All of these women are divorced with the same bill of divorce that contains a list of several couples. <b>And the Torah said: “And he writes her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and</b> it is derived from this phrase that he <b>cannot</b> write it both <b>for her and for another</b> woman. Rather, each woman requires a separate bill of divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | And the Torah said: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her, | Gittin 89a:4 | <b>R' Yoḥanan ben Nuri said to him: If so, you have not allowed</b> any <b>daughter of Abraham our forefather to remain with her husband, </b> i.e., all wives will be forced to leave their husbands, as it is common for women to slander their peers. <b>And the Torah said: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her, </b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it says over there: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as there, </b> the word “matter” is referring to <b>a clear matter, </b> as it is established through witnesses, <b>so too here, </b> the unseemly matter that is considered a cause for divorce is also referring to <b>a clear matter</b> that was not established merely through a rumor. Rava’s statement is in accordance with this opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter [ ervat davar ] in her, | Gittin 90a:2 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: A man may not divorce his wife unless he finds</b> out <b>about her</b> having engaged in <b>a matter of forbidden sex [<i>devar erva</i>], </b> i.e., she committed adultery or is suspected of doing so, <b>as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>ervat davar</i>] in her, </b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1). |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes” | Gittin 90a:4 | <b>R' Akiva says: </b> He may divorce her <b>even</b> if <b>he found another woman</b> who is <b>better looking than her</b> and wishes to marry her, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: <b>“And it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 11b:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “When a man takes a woman and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and one derives</b> betrothal through money by a verbal analogy of the term <b>“taking”</b> used here and <b>“taking” from</b> the case of <b>the field of Ephron. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in the Mishnah that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> one can betroth a woman <b>with one <i>peruta</i> or with</b> any item that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>. </b> If so, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Asi, </b> who claims that all sums of money mentioned in the Torah are in Tyrian coinage, <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | Sending away, | Kiddushin 24b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason of R' Shimon? He derives</b> a verbal analogy between: <b>Sending away, </b> “to freedom shall he send him” (Exodus 21:26, 27), and: <b>Sending away, </b> “and sends her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>from</b> the case of <b>a woman. Just as a woman</b> can be released from her husband only <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, so too, a slave</b> can <b>also</b> be released from his master only <b>by</b> means of <b>a document. And R' Meir</b> would say that <b>if</b> the term <b>“freedom” was written at the end</b> of the phrase, i.e., if the verse had stated: He shall send him away to freedom, it would be <b>as you said, </b> that he must be given a bill of manumission before he can be emancipated. <b>Now that it is written “to freedom shall he send him, ”</b> this indicates that <b>he is free from the beginning, </b> i.e., no additional act of emancipation is required. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “When a man takes a woman” | Kiddushin 2a:4 | The Talmud continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money? </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron. </b> How so? <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there, </b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | As it is taught | Kiddushin 41a:9 | § The Mishnah states that an agent has the power to effect betrothal. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that there is halakhic <b>agency? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to one who divorces his wife: “That he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand, and sends her [<i>veshilleḥah</i>] out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The verse employs the verb: <b>And he sends [<i>veshillaḥ</i>]. </b> The fact that the verse employs the term <i>veshillaḥ</i>, as opposed to another verb denoting divorce, <i>vegereshah</i>, <b>teaches that he can appoint an agent [<i>shaliaḥ</i>], </b> as both words share the root <i>shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>ḥet</i>. The husband does not have to personally give his wife the bill of divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “And engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 4b:10 | The <i>baraita</i> continues to interpret the verse. The phrase: <b>“And has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>can be acquired through sex. </b> Why is it necessary for the verse to state this explicitly? Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: And if a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot be acquired through money, can be acquired through sex, is it not logical that this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through money, </b> as derived above, <b>can</b> also <b>be acquired through sex? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | in her, | Kiddushin 4b:3 | § The Talmud notes: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman can be betrothed with money <b>from here, </b> a different source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man takes a woman and has sex with her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found</b> some unseemly matter <b>in her, </b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), in this verse, the term <b>taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 51a:10 | § <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> had a dispute: With regard to <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation, Abaye says it is betrothal, </b> since the prohibition against having sex does not affect the betrothal itself. <b>Rava says: It is not betrothal. Rava says: </b> The Sage <b>bar Ahina explained to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: <b>“When a man takes a woman and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), as it indicates that <b>betrothal that is given to</b> permitted <b>consummation is betrothal, </b> whereas <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation is not betrothal. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | monetary matters. | Kiddushin 65b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> the case of one who betroths another in the presence of one witness? <b>Rav Kahana said: One</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. <b>Rav Pappa said: One</b> need <b>be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: What is your opinion</b> that leads you to claim that there is no concern that his betrothal has taken effect? It must be <b>that you derive</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to forbidden sex and the word <b>matter</b> written with regard to <b>monetary matters. </b> The Torah states concerning one who desires to divorce his wife: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), a reference to adulterous sex, and with regard to monetary matters it states: “At the mouths of two witnesses, or at the mouths of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | takes | Kiddushin 6a:1 | <b>last expressions</b> are <b>what he teaches us. </b> The novelty of Shmuel’s statement is that with regard to the second set of pronouncements there is no concern at all that a valid betrothal or divorce might have been performed. The Talmud explains why according to Shmuel these pronouncements are not of concern. <b>Here, </b> in the case of betrothal, it is <b>written: “When</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 24:1), which indicates that the man is acting to change the status of the woman, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he takes himself</b> or gives himself to her, as in the case of one who says: I am hereby your man. <b>And</b> likewise, it is <b>written here, </b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And sends her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he sends himself</b> from her, as in the case of one who says: I am not your man. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | my taken one, she is betrothed, because it is stated: “When a man takes a woman” | Kiddushin 6a:4 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to a woman: You are hereby <b>my taken one, she is betrothed, because it is stated: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | the Merciful One states: | Kiddushin 7a:11 | § <b>Rava says</b> that if a man says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to half of me, she is betrothed. </b> But if he said to her: <b>Half of you is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed. Abaye said to Rava: What is different</b> between the two cases <b>that</b> if he says: <b>Half of you is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed? </b> Is it because <b>God states: </b> “When a man takes a woman, and marries her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), indicating he must take <b>“a woman, ” and not half a woman? So too, God states: “A man, ” and not half a man. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | and engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 9b:14 | The Talmud returns to the different derivations of R' Yehuda HaNasi and R' Yoḥanan. <b>And R' Yoḥanan, </b> who maintains that the mode of betrothal through sex is derived from the verse: “If a man be found lying with a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:22), what does he <b>do with this</b> verse: “When a man takes a woman <b>and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? The Talmud answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse for a different <i>halakha</i>, as he maintains that it teaches that <b>this</b> woman <b>can be acquired through sex, but a Hebrew female slave cannot be acquired through sex. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 9b:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said: Bar Ahina explained this to me</b> by citing a proof from the following verse: <b>“When a man takes a woman and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), which teaches that <b>betrothal that is given to consummation, </b> i.e., betrothal when it is permitted for the man and woman to have sex, <b>is a betrothal, </b> but <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal, what is there to say? </b> Since he uses this verse for a different purpose, from where does Rava derive that a woman can be betrothed through sex and that a Hebrew female slave cannot be acquired in this manner? |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | and engages in sexual intercourse with her” | Kiddushin 9b:7 | § The Mishnah teaches that a woman can be betrothed <b>through sex. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “If a man be found lying with <b>a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22). This <b>teaches that he becomes her husband [<i>ba’al</i>] by means of sex [<i>be’ila</i>]. R' Zeira said to R' Abbahu, and some say</b> it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said this <b>to R' Yoḥanan: </b> Is <b>this</b> other proof, <b>taught by R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>unacceptable: </b> “When a man takes a woman <b>and has sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>she can be acquired through sex. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | “Then it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter about her” | Nazir 2a:5 | The Talmud answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is engaged in</b> the study of <b>the verse</b> pertaining to divorce: <b>“Then it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>And this is what he is saying: What caused</b> the woman <b>to</b> commit the <b>transgression</b> of adultery, alluded to in the verse by the phrase “unseemly matter”? It was <b>wine. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> is <b>saying: Anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace should abstain from wine. </b> Consequently, tractate <i>Nazir</i> is placed in the order of <i>Nashim</i>, immediately preceding tractate <i>Sota</i>, which is about a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful, and tractate <i>Gittin</i>, which discusses divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | bill [ sefer ] | Sotah 16a:6 | <b>The Torah states: </b> “And whatsoever man…that takes in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it <b>in dust”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the blood may be covered <b>in anything</b> similar to dust. <b>The Torah states</b> with regard to the nazirite: “All the days of his vow of naziriteship there shall be no <b>razor</b> come upon his head” (Numbers 6:5), <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the nazirite may not remove his hair <b>with anything. The Torah states: </b> “That he writes her a <b>bill [<i>sefer</i>]</b> of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The word <i>sefer</i> denotes a scroll, <b>but the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the husband may inscribe the bill of divorce <b>on anything</b> that is detached from the ground and suitable to be written upon, not only on a scroll. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | the Merciful One states: “And he shall write for her | Sotah 20b:6 | The rabbis <b>say</b> in response: <b>There, </b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>God states: “And he shall write for her</b> a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This teaches that <b>we require the writing</b> to be performed <b>for the sake of</b> the specific woman. However, no similar requirement is mentioned with regard to a <i>sota</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>Here, too, </b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>, the verse states: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>perform with her</b> all of this law” (Numbers 5:30), indicating that the ritual must be performed for the sake of the specific woman. The Talmud answers: <b>What</b> is the <b>performance</b> referred to in the verse? It is referring to the <b>erasure, </b> whereas the writing need not be done for the sake of a specific woman. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | monetary matters. | Sotah 2b:6 | The Talmud explains its question: If the verse is understood as indicating that a woman isn’t forbidden <b>until there are two witnesses</b> to testify to her infidelity, then <b>let the verse be silent from</b> any mention of witnesses, <b>as</b> the requirement for two witnesses in matters of sexual impropriety <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to forbidden sex, and the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to <b>monetary matters. </b> The verbal analogy by which it is learned that two witnesses are required is as follows: A verse concerning forbidden sex states: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), and a verse concerning monetary matters states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>And I</b> would <b>know</b> that the requirement that two witnesses testify applies in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>just as it does in all</b> other matters of <b>testimony in the Torah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | because he has found some unseemly matter [ davar ] in her” | Sotah 31b:2 | Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: </b> “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] in her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there, </b> in the laws concerning monetary matters, <b>it states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, </b> or at the mouth of three witnesses, <b>shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the “matter” stated <b>there</b> is established <b>“at the mouth of two witnesses, ” so too, here</b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>“at the mouth of two</b> witnesses. ” |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | because he has found some unseemly matter [ davar ] in her” | Sotah 31b:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud questions why the Mishnah proves the need for two witnesses to testify about the seclusion based upon the verbal analogy of “matter” and “matter,” if there is an explicit source in the Torah stating that two witnesses are required. <b>This</b> reason is given by the Mishnah: <b>The verse states: </b> “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] in her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), which through a verbal analogy based on the word “<i>davar</i>” teaches the need for two witnesses, seems to be superfluous. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | matter [ davar ] | Sotah 31b:8 | The Talmud continues to explain the Mishnah: <b>And</b> concerning <b>an ordinary</b> accusation of <b>defilement without a</b> previous <b>warning and without</b> an act of <b>seclusion</b> with another man, <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>a single witness is not deemed credible? </b> It is for this <i>halakha</i> that the Mishnah cites the verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here: </b> “Because he has found some unseemly <b>matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> concerning monetary matters: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall <b>a matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as</b> the “matter” stated <b>there</b> with regard to monetary matters is clarified specifically <b>by</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses, so too, here</b> with regard to adultery the “matter” of her defilement must be established <b>by</b> the testimony of at least <b>two witnesses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | because he has found some unseemly matter [ davar ] about her” | Sotah 3b:19 | Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: </b> “If a man marries a woman and lives with her and it will be that she not find favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there, </b> in the verses concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters, <b>it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established <b>by the mouth of two witnesses, so too here, </b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>by the mouth of two</b> witnesses. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | derived from: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her” | Sotah 3b:20 | The Talmud asks: Is <b>this</b> need for two witnesses <b>derived from: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? <b>It is derived from: </b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement (2a). The Talmud above (2b) derives from the term “<i>bah</i>,” which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it, </b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning. </b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion. </b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion. The Mishnah <b>should have</b> given this inference as the source for requiring two witnesses for seclusion, and not the juxtaposition of “matter” and “matter. ” |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her” | Sotah 3b:22 | The Talmud comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>defilement in general, without</b> a prior <b>warning and without</b> witnesses to <b>seclusion, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established by <b>two witnesses, so too here, </b> with regard to defilement it is established by <b>two witnesses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | Rav Yosef said: | Sotah 5b:8 | <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> With regard to a man who divorces his wife because: “He has found some unseemly matter about her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), i.e., he suspects her of sexual impropriety, <b>the verse states: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). It is inferred from this that she is free <b>to</b> marry <b>another man, but</b> she is <b>not</b> permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>the <i>yavam</i>. </b> The <i>yavam</i> is not considered “another man,” as he takes the place of his brother. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | a scroll [ sefer ] | Sukkah 24b:2 | § <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>in the name of R' Yosei HaGelili they said: Nor</b> may <b>one write bills of divorce on it. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yosei HaGelili? </b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, and it comes to pass if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her; that he write her <b>a scroll [<i>sefer</i>]</b> of severance and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1); from the word scroll, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a scroll</b> is fit. <b>From where</b> do I derive <b>to include all objects</b> as fit materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The verse states: “That he write her, ” in any case, </b> i.e., any surface upon which the formula can be written. |
| Deuteronomy 24:1 | taking. | Yevamot 55b:4 | The Talmud asks further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a woman</b> is betrothed <b>to her husband</b> through the initial stage of sex? The Talmud answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the words <b>taking</b> and <b>taking. </b> With regard to betrothal, the verse states: “When a man takes a wife and marries her” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This verb is also used with regard to forbidden sex, as in the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17). |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes | Gittin 78b:11 | <b>R' Abba raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>R' Asi</b> from what was explicitly taught in the Mishnah: <b>And</b> the <b>same</b> <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>with regard to betrothal. </b> He responded: <b>It is different there</b> with regard to betrothal, <b>as it is written: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). The Torah thereby compares betrothal, through the use of the word “becomes,” to divorce, through the use of the words “and she departs,” so one can learn the <i>halakhot</i> of betrothal from the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce. One cannot learn <i>halakhot</i> concerning other matters from divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” | Gittin 82b:4 | <b>R' Yannai said in the name of one elder</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), indicating that <b>even</b> if he divorced her in a manner that <b>only permitted her to</b> marry one <b>other man, she is divorced, </b> i.e., this partial severance takes effect. <b>And the Rabbis would say</b> in response to <b>R' Eliezer’s explanation</b> that <b>this</b> phrase: Another <b>man, </b> which appears in the verse refers not to a specific man but <b>to any man, </b> i.e., it must be permitted for her to marry any man for the divorce to take effect. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “And becomes | Gittin 82b:8 | <b>Let the dilemma be raised according to R' Eliezer: </b> Is <b>R' Eliezer saying only here</b> that the divorce is valid <b>because verses are written</b> that support this proposition, as delineated by R' Yannai and R' Yoḥanan; <b>but there, </b> in the case of betrothal, <b>a proper acquisition is necessary, </b> which is not the case when a certain man is excluded from the prohibition to have sex with her? <b>Or</b> should it <b>perhaps</b> be derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house,” and the clause: <b>“And becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), which serves as a basis for the comparison of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal, teaching that just as divorce takes effect in this manner, so does betrothal? |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | in the name of one elder | Gittin 83b:5 | The Talmud answers: <b>Rava taught</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yannai, </b> who said <b>in the name of one elder</b> that R' Eliezer’s opinion is derived not from the prohibition against marrying into the priesthood, but from the verse: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), which indicates that even if he divorced her in a manner that permitted her to marry only one other man, the divorce takes effect. Therefore, Rava refutes R' Akiva’s latter objection by claiming that the prohibition against marrying into the priesthood is different from other prohibitions and cannot be compared to them. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “And becomes” | Gittin 85a:12 | <b>Why</b> can she? <b>But don’t we need</b> there to be a broad similarity between the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal, as derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs, ”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which serves as the basis for the comparison of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal? Accordingly, since she will not be eligible to receive her own betrothal until she reaches majority, she should not be able to receive her bill of divorce. <b>Rather, </b> evidently, since <b>she will</b> eventually <b>reach</b> the age of eligibility to receive her own <b>betrothal</b> she is considered essentially eligible for betrothal now as well. <b>Here also, </b> since the minor boy, whom the husband prohibited the wife from marrying, <b>will reach</b> the age of eligibility for <b>betrothal, </b> the divorce is invalid. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “And becomes” | Gittin 85a:25 | The Talmud raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> ability to enter <b>betrothal by</b> receiving <b>a document, </b> i.e., if another man betroths her by giving her a document of betrothal, the betrothal will not take effect, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that since one <b>can</b> still <b>betroth her with money or with sex, </b> the act of severance is complete? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), that the different ways of <b>becoming</b> a wife <b>are compared to each other, </b> so that the inability to perform one of them renders the severance incomplete? |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | matter she may marry another | Gittin 90a:6 | <b>Beit Hillel said to them: If</b> the word <b>“unseemly” had been stated and</b> the word <b>“matter” had not been stated, I would have said</b> that a wife <b>should leave</b> her husband <b>due to forbidden sex, </b> but <b>she should not</b> have to <b>leave</b> him <b>due to</b> any other <b>matter. Therefore, </b> the word <b>“matter” is stated. And if</b> the word <b>“matter” had been stated and</b> the word <b>“unseemly” had not been stated, I would have said</b> that if he divorced her merely <b>due to</b> a disadvantageous <b>matter she may marry another</b> man, as the Torah continues: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). <b>But</b> if she was divorced <b>due to</b> her engaging in <b>forbidden sex, she may not marry another</b> man, as she is prohibited from remarrying. <b>Therefore, </b> the word <b>“unseemly” is stated, </b> indicating that even a wife who is divorced due to adultery is permitted to remarry. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | the verse states: “And she becomes another man’s wife” | Ketubot 46b:13 | § The Mishnah taught that a father is entitled to accept betrothal of his daughter through a marriage <b>document or</b> through <b>sex. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: “And she becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). Since the verse does not specify how she becomes his wife, the different ways of <b>becoming</b> a wife <b>are compared to each other, </b> i.e., they are considered equal. Accordingly, the various methods of betrothal are the same with regard to the authority of the father. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes | Ketubot 47a:7 | The Mishnah further taught: <b>And he accepts her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Talmud answers <b>that it is written: “And she departs</b> out of his house and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). This verse <b>juxtaposes departing</b> a marriage <b>and becoming</b> a wife, which teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of betrothal apply to her departing her husband’s home via a bill of divorce. Consequently, just as a father has the right to accept betrothal on his daughter’s behalf, he can also receive a bill of divorce on her behalf. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | are juxtaposed to each other. | Ketubot 74a:9 | The Talmud answers: <b>There, </b> in the case of betrothal, there is a special reason for this law, <b>because</b> the different ways of <b>becoming</b> betrothed <b>are juxtaposed to each other. </b> The Torah describes betrothal with the term becoming, as in the expression: “And she becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). Betrothal can be performed through the transference of money or an item of value, through a document, or through sex. All three forms are juxtaposed with one another. Conditions can be stipulated for betrothal performed via transference of money or through a document, since these methods of betrothal can be fulfilled through an agent. Therefore, a condition may also be stipulated for betrothal through sex, although that cannot be fulfilled through an agent. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes | Kiddushin 41a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>We found</b> a source for agency <b>with regard to divorce; from where do we</b> derive that there is agency <b>with regard to betrothal? And if you would say that</b> it <b>is derived from divorce, </b> i.e., just as a wife can be divorced from her husband by means of an agent, she can become betrothed to him in the same way, the two cases are not similar: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about divorce is that it</b> can be effected <b>against her will, </b> while betrothal cannot. Therefore, a means of effecting divorce cannot necessarily be used to effect betrothal. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). Because the verse <b>juxtaposes becoming</b> married <b>to leaving</b> a marriage, <b>just as</b> a husband can <b>appoint an agent</b> for the purpose of <b>leaving</b> a marriage, <b>so too he</b> can <b>appoint an agent</b> for the purpose of <b>becoming</b> married. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | becomes | Kiddushin 44a:15 | The Talmud relates: One day <b>R' Asi did not go to the study hall. He found R' Zeira</b> and <b>said to him: What was said today in the study hall? </b> R' Zeira <b>said to him: I too did not go, </b> but <b>R' Avin is the one who went, and he said: The entire coterie</b> sided <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> that there is a difference between betrothal and divorce in the case of a young woman. <b>And Reish Lakish screamed</b> at them <b>like a crane: </b> Doesn’t the verse state: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house <b>and</b> goes and <b>becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), juxtaposing the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal? <b>But no one paid any attention to him. </b> R' Asi <b>said to him: </b> Is <b>R' Avin reliable? </b> Can one be sure that he transmitted an accurate report? R' Zeira <b>said to him: Yes, </b> in this case he can be trusted, since the elapsed time <b>was</b> only <b>like</b> the interval between catching a fish <b>from the sea</b> and bringing it <b>to a frying pan [<i>tignei</i>]. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes | Kiddushin 48a:10 | <b>After</b> Reish Lakish <b>raised the dilemma, </b> he <b>then resolved it: </b> The verse states: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> the verb <b>becoming to</b> the verb <b>leaving, </b> so a bill of divorce and a document of betrothal must be written for her sake to be valid. <b>One Sage, </b> R' Meir, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, </b> and maintains that she is not betrothed if the document was not written for her sake. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage, </b> R' Elazar, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish. </b> The Rabbis remain uncertain, and therefore view the case as betrothal by means of giving an item worth money. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes | Kiddushin 5a:3 | Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And she leaves</b> his house and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). This verse <b>juxtaposes becoming, </b> i.e., betrothal, <b>to leaving, </b> i.e., divorce. <b>Just as leaving</b> is performed <b>through a document, </b> i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>so too, becoming</b> can be performed <b>through a document. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And let one also juxtapose leaving to becoming, </b> in the opposite direction: <b>Just as becoming is</b> performed <b>through money, so too, leaving</b> can be effected <b>through money. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | written: “And she leaves and becomes” | Kiddushin 5a:6 | <b>Rava said: </b> The <i>halakha</i> that a woman cannot be divorced by means of money is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states: “And he writes her</b> a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:3). This indicates that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>through writing and she is not divorced through money. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> as this point is not stated explicitly and is inferred from the verse, one can instead <b>say</b> the following interpretation: <b>She is divorced through writing, and she is not betrothed through writing. </b> The Talmud rejects this suggestion. It is <b>written: “And she leaves and becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which <b>juxtaposes</b> betrothal to divorce, indicating that betrothal can be effected with a document. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and that | Kiddushin 67b:12 | The Talmud suggests another interpretation of the verses. <b>But</b> as the verse has already prohibited betrothal to a wife’s sister, one can <b>say</b> as follows: Both <b>this</b> verse: “You shall not take” (Leviticus 18:18), <b>and that</b> one: “Becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), are referring <b>to a wife’s sister, </b> as <b>this</b> one: “You shall not take,” prohibits this relationship <b><i>ab initio</i>, </b> whereas <b>that</b> verse: “Another man’s wife,” teaches that this betrothal is of no effect even <b>after the fact. </b> The Talmud responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so. </b> The verse should be interpreted in this manner. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” | Kiddushin 67b:8 | § The Mishnah teaches that in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in <b>betrothal with him, </b> but she can join in betrothal with others, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. The Talmud explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was said <b>in the name of R' Yannai; and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, determined</b> that <b>it</b> was said <b>in the name of R' Yosei HaGelili: The verse states</b> with regard to a divorced woman: <b>“And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). This teaches that she can become the wife <b>of others, but not of relatives, </b> i.e., betrothal to forbidden relatives does not take effect. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and becomes” | Kiddushin 9b:2 | <b>After he raised the dilemma, </b> R' Shimon ben Lakish <b>then resolved it. We juxtapose becoming</b> betrothed <b>to leaving</b> a marriage, <b>as the verse states: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). This shows that the <i>halakhot</i> of a betrothal document are derived from those of a bill of divorce, and therefore a document of betrothal must also be written for her sake. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | the verse states: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” | Sotah 5b:8 | <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> With regard to a man who divorces his wife because: “He has found some unseemly matter about her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), i.e., he suspects her of sexual impropriety, <b>the verse states: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). It is inferred from this that she is free <b>to</b> marry <b>another man, but</b> she is <b>not</b> permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>the <i>yavam</i>. </b> The <i>yavam</i> is not considered “another man,” as he takes the place of his brother. |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | “another | Sotah 6a:2 | <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Yosef said</b> differently: <b>The verse calls</b> a man who marries a woman after she was divorced from her first husband due to suspicion of adultery <b>“another</b> man,” as the verse states: “And she departs out of his house and goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). This indicates that one who subsequently marries her <b>is not a peer of</b> her <b>first</b> husband <b>because this</b> one, the first husband, <b>removed an evil woman from his house, and that</b> one <b>brought an evil woman into his house. </b> There is an implied criticism of the second husband in the verse; <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that the verse instructs that <b>she should also enter into levirate marriage. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:2 | and matrimony are written in this | Yevamot 11b:6 | <b>What is the rationale</b> of R' Yosei ben Keifar? In his opinion, “after she was defiled” does not refer to a <i>sota</i> but to a woman who had been legally divorced from her first husband and subsequently married another man. This is indicated by the fact that both <b>becoming, </b> i.e., betrothal, <b>and matrimony are written in this</b> context: “Becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2) and: “Or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife” (Deuteronomy 24:3). Here it is clear that the reference is to halakhically valid marriage, whereas a <i>sota</i> had never been another man’s wife, as she cannot marry another man while she is still married. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | “To her” | Chagigah 4a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>After all, </b> with regard to <b>every mitzva in which a woman is obligated, a slave is</b> also <b>obligated in that</b> mitzva; and with regard to <b>every mitzva in which a woman is not obligated, a slave is not obligated in it</b> either. The reason for this principle is <b>that it is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“To her”</b> (Leviticus 19:20), written with regard to a designated female slave, and the phrase: <b>“To her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), written with regard <b>to a</b> divorced <b>woman. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | for her” | Gittin 25a:5 | <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for R' Yoḥanan to state that there is no retroactive clarification both with regard to inheritance and with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>as, if it were stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case, that of a bill of divorce, then one could say that <b>with regard to this R' Yoḥanan said that there is no</b> retroactive <b>clarification because we require</b> that the bill of divorce be written in accordance with the verse: “He writes <b>for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), i.e., <b>for her sake; but there, </b> in the case of inheritance, one could say: <b>It is</b> only in the case of <b>a sale that God states that it will be returned in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>but an inheritance and a gift</b> will <b>not</b> be returned. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | a wife: | Gittin 39b:2 | The Talmud continues explaining the possible inference. <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: What is the reasoning of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He derived</b> this by means of a verbal analogy, understanding the meaning of <b>“to her [<i>lah</i>], ”</b> written with regard to a female slave in the verse: “Nor was freedom given to her” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>“for her [<i>lah</i>], ”</b> written with regard to <b>a wife: </b> “And he writes for her a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>Just as a wife</b> is released from her husband <b>via a bill</b> of divorce, <b>so too, a slave</b> is <b>also</b> emancipated only <b>via a bill</b> of manumission. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | “And the latter husband hates | Gittin 90b:4 | If <b>the second</b> man <b>merits, he will send her out, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“And the latter husband hates</b> her…and he sends her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>And if not, she will bury him, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“Or if the latter husband dies. ”</b> It is <b>appropriate for him to</b> receive the punishment of <b>death, as that</b> first man <b>evicted a wicked woman from his house and this</b> second husband <b>introduced a wicked woman into his house. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | And furthermore, it is written: “And the latter husband hates her, and writes her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies” | Kiddushin 13b:16 | <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>statement: First, a <i>yavam</i> is not called “another, ”</b> as his relationship with her is not entirely separate from that of the first husband. <b>And furthermore, it is written: “And the latter husband hates her, and writes her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3). In this manner the verse <b>juxtaposes death to divorce: Just as divorce permits</b> a woman to everyone <b>and completes</b> the severing of a husband from his wife, thereby allowing her to marry another man, <b>so too, death permits</b> her <b>and completes</b> the severing, allowing her to marry another man. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | for her | Kiddushin 14a:15 | Rather, the Talmud explains that here too, there is a limitation derived from a verse. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a bill of divorce: “And write <b>for her</b> a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>“For her”</b> is a limitation, which teaches: A bill of divorce is effective for a regular woman <b>but not for a <i>yevama</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the phrase <b>“for her”</b> indicates that the bill of divorce must be written <b>for her sake. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | “A scroll of severance” | Kiddushin 14a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let a married woman leave</b> a marriage <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot leave through a bill of divorce, can leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, is it not logical</b> that <b>this</b> married woman, <b>who can leave through a bill of divorce, can</b> likewise <b>leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a married woman: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which indicates that <b>a scroll, </b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him. While the husband is alive only a bill of divorce can dissolve a marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | a wife: | Kiddushin 23a:15 | <b>Rabba said: What is the reason of R' Shimon ben Elazar? He derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy, understanding the meaning of <b>“to her [<i>lah</i>], ”</b> written with regard to a female slave in the verse: “Nor was freedom given to her” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>“for her [<i>lah</i>], ”</b> written with regard to <b>a wife: </b> “And he writes for her a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>Just as a woman</b> is not divorced <b>until</b> the husband <b>moves</b> the <b>bill of divorce</b> from his domain <b>to a domain that is not his, </b> and the bill of divorce is ineffective as long as it remains in his domain; <b>so too, a slave</b> is not freed <b>unless</b> the master <b>moves</b> the <b>bill</b> of manumission <b>to a domain that is not his. </b> Since the slave belongs to him, the document will remain the master’s even if he gives it to the slave. Therefore, he can be freed by means of a document only through other people who receive the document on his behalf. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | “A scroll of severance” | Kiddushin 3b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too, </b> this is the case, i.e., a married woman can be released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which teaches: <b>A scroll, </b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband, <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | The verse states: “And he writes her | Kiddushin 5a:6 | <b>Rava said: </b> The <i>halakha</i> that a woman cannot be divorced by means of money is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states: “And he writes her</b> a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:3). This indicates that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>through writing and she is not divorced through money. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> as this point is not stated explicitly and is inferred from the verse, one can instead <b>say</b> the following interpretation: <b>She is divorced through writing, and she is not betrothed through writing. </b> The Talmud rejects this suggestion. It is <b>written: “And she leaves and becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which <b>juxtaposes</b> betrothal to divorce, indicating that betrothal can be effected with a document. |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | and give it into her hand” | Yevamot 113b:6 | The Talmud asks: Is it correct that <b>by Torah law an imbecilic woman may be divorced? But</b> didn’t a Sage of <b>the school of R' Yannai say, </b> with regard to the verse: “He shall write her a bill of divorce <b>and give it into her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), that this refers only <b>to</b> a woman <b>who has a hand, </b> i.e., she has enough intellectual capacity <b>to</b> accept a bill of <b>divorce</b> for <b>herself. </b> This serves <b>to exclude this</b> imbecilic woman, <b>who does not have a hand to</b> accept her <b>divorce</b> for <b>herself. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:3 | “And send her out of his house” | Yevamot 113b:7 | <b>And the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> this slightly differently. The verse continues: <b>“And send her out of his house”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3); this indicates that one may divorce only the type of woman <b>whom he will send away and she will not return. </b> It serves <b>to exclude this</b> imbecilic woman, as <b>he will send her away and she will return, </b> as she does not understand the concept of divorce. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | “That is an abomination” | Kiddushin 77a:13 | § <b>A baraita states: Who is a <i>ḥalala</i>? </b> The term is referring to <b>any</b> woman <b>born from</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of people of <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>If we say</b> it means she was born from someone <b>unfit for him, </b> i.e., a woman forbidden to this particular man due to a family relationship or for some other reason, <b>isn’t there</b> the case of one who <b>remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to someone else in the interim; she is <b>unfit for him, and</b> yet <b>her children are fit. As it is written</b> with regard to this case: <b>“That is an abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and this is interpreted to mean: <b>That</b> marriage <b>is an abomination, but the children of</b> that marriage <b>are not an abomination</b> and are entirely fit. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | “Take her again to be his wife” | Kiddushin 78a:8 | The Talmud notes: <b>And</b> although <b>Abaye</b> holds that the act of betrothal itself is forbidden, he <b>concedes in</b> the case of an Israelite who <b>remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to someone else in the interim, <b>that if he betrothed</b> her <b>without having sex, he is not flogged. </b> Why not? It is as <b>God states</b> in the Torah with regard to this prohibition: <b>“Take her again to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), which indicates that the act of betrothal is forbidden only if it leads to the intimacy of marriage, <b>and</b> there is <b>no</b> such intimacy here since he has not had sex with her. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | after she was defiled” | Yevamot 11b:2 | But with regard to <b>an uncertain <i>sota</i>, </b> who was alone with a specific man enough time to engage in sex, <b>defilement is written as well. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei ben Keifar said in the name of R' Elazar: </b> With regard to <b>one who remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to another man, an act prohibited by Torah law, if he remarried her <b>following</b> actual <b>marriage</b> to another, <b>she is forbidden</b> to her first husband. However, if he remarried her <b>following</b> mere <b>betrothal</b> to another man, <b>she is permitted, because it is stated: </b> “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, <b>after she was defiled”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and a woman who was merely betrothed was never defiled, as no sexual sex had taken place. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | because it is written: “That is an abomination” | Yevamot 11b:8 | <b>And if</b> one would claim that the dilemma does in fact arise <b>because it is written: “That is an abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and the emphasis on “that” serves to limit the range of the prohibition and teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to her and not her rival wife, still, the accepted interpretation of this verse is as follows: <b>She is an abomination, but her children are not abominations. </b> In other words, if he transgressed the prohibition and remarried this woman, their children are not disqualified from marrying priests. If so, the term “that” does not come to exclude her rival wife from this <i>halakha</i>, and therefore <b>her rival wife is an abomination</b> for the purposes of levirate marriage, just like the wife herself, and she too is exempt. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | And furthermore, “She is an abomination” | Yevamot 44b:4 | <b>And furthermore, “She is an abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4) <b>is written</b> with regard to remarrying with one’s divorcée, and the emphasis on the word “she” teaches that only she is considered so, <b>but her children are not abominations</b> and they have unflawed lineage. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not | Yevamot 52b:6 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one gives a bill of divorce to his <i>yevama</i>, she is forbidden to him forever</b> and he no longer has the option of marrying her? As it <b>is stated</b> with regard to a woman who was divorced and married another man who subsequently died or divorced her: <b>“Her former husband, who sent her away, may not</b> take her again to be his wife” (Deuteronomy 24:4). R' Akiva emphasizes the words “who sent her away,” implying that he may not remarry her <b>after sending</b> her <b>away. </b> This indicates that there is an instance where a husband may not remarry his wife even if she has not married another, merely because he has given her a bill of divorce. This applies to the case of a <i>yevama</i> where the bill of divorce she receives renders her permanently prohibited to him. According to R' Akiva, once she is rendered prohibited to him, no further action performed by the <i>yavam</i> is effective, so why does the levirate betrothal performed require a bill of divorce? |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | after she was made ritually impure” | Yevamot 56b:12 | <b>Rava said: All were included</b> in the verse “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife <b>after she was made ritually impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4). <b>When the verse specified with regard to the wife of an Israelite: “And neither was she taken, ”</b> as it is only in that case that she is <b>forbidden, </b> it thereby indicates that if <b>she was</b> forcibly <b>taken</b> she is <b>permitted. By inference, the wife of a priest remains as she was, </b> and she is forbidden. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | writes it. | Yevamot 78a:3 | The Talmud raises an objection: But <b>isn’t</b> there the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to another man? This is a case of <b>that if</b> that leads <b>to an allowance, and</b> yet the Torah <b>writes it. </b> The words “It is an abomination before YHWH” (Deuteronomy 24:4) stated with regard to this case teach that although the woman herself is forbidden to her first husband, if she nevertheless remarried him, their children are fit to enter into the congregation. The Talmud answers: <b>There, </b> the Torah <b>writes</b> that case <b>due to the basic prohibition, </b> i.e., that a man may not remarry his divorced wife after she has been married to another man, and the allowance with regard to their children is learned incidentally. |
| Deuteronomy 24:4 | As the body is defiled | Yevamot 95a:11 | The Talmud refutes this interpretation: <b>What</b> about the fact <b>that one who remarries his divorcée after she married</b> another man cannot be considered to have violated a light prohibition, as the prohibition is stringent in several regards: <b>As the body is defiled</b> by this sex, for the Torah states “after she has been defiled” (Deuteronomy 24:4); <b>and her prohibition</b> applies <b>to the majority</b> of the Jewish people, not to select groups; <b>and her prohibition</b> is <b>an irrevocable prohibition, </b> as she is no longer permitted to her first husband after having sex with her second husband. This last stringency is not true of his wife’s sister, who is permitted to him after the death of his wife. |
| Deuteronomy 24:5 | marry another woman, | Moed Katan9b:7 | When they said that <b>your table should become confused, </b> they meant that you should be blessed <b>with</b> many <b>sons and daughters, </b> so that there will be noise and confusion at your table. When they said that <b>you should not see a new year, </b> they meant <b>your wife should not die and</b> as a result <b>you should not</b> have to <b>marry another woman, </b> about which it says: “When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free at home for one year” (Deuteronomy 24:5). |
| Deuteronomy 24:5 | even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy, | Sotah 10a:15 | <b>Rava taught: For what</b> reason was <b>Asa punished</b> in his feet? <b>Because he made Torah scholars perform forced labor [<i>angarya</i>], as it is stated: “Then King Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted; </b> and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof, with which Baasa had built, and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah” (I Kings 15:22). The superfluous expression “unto all” indicates that the proclamation was issued to <b>everyone, including</b> Torah scholars. The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the next phrase in the verse: <b>“None was exempted [<i>ein naki</i>]”? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> This includes <b>even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy, </b> as the verse states with regard to a bridegroom: “He shall be free [<i>naki</i>] for his house one year” (Deuteronomy 24:5). |
| Deuteronomy 24:5 | he shall be free for his house one year, | Sotah 43a:8 | <b>These</b> are the men <b>who do not</b> even <b>move from their places</b> because they do not even report to the camp: One who <b>built a house and dedicated it</b> within the year; one who <b>planted a vineyard and used its fruit</b> for less than a year; one <b>who marries his betrothed</b> and <b>one who marries his <i>yevama</i>, </b> his brother’s widow who must enter into a levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is stated: </b> “When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army…<b>he shall be free for his house one year, </b> and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken” (Deuteronomy 24:5). The Mishnah interprets the verse as follows: <b>“For his house”; this</b> means <b>his house</b> that he built. <b>“He shall be”; this</b> term includes <b>his vineyard. “And shall cheer his wife”; this is his wife. “Whom he has taken”; </b> this phrase comes <b>to include his <i>yevama</i>, </b> who is considered his wife with respect to this <i>halakha</i> although he has not yet married her. Those who are exempt for these reasons <b>do not</b> even <b>provide water and food</b> to the soldiers, <b>and</b> they <b>do not repair the roads. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:5 | “He shall not go out with the army” | Sotah 44a:10 | <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“He shall not go out with the army”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:5); one <b>might</b> have thought it is <b>with the army that he does not go out, but</b> he does go to <b>supply water and food</b> to the army <b>and to repair the roads</b> for them. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Neither shall he be charged with any business. ”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even one who has built a house and has not dedicated it, </b> or <b>one who has planted a vineyard and has not used its fruit, </b> or <b>one who has betrothed a woman and has not taken her</b> as his wife? <b>The verse states: </b> “Neither shall <b>he</b> be charged with any business”; <b>you do not charge him with any</b> responsibilities, <b>but you do charge others. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And since</b> the Torah <b>states: “Neither shall he be charged</b> with any business,” <b>why do I</b> need to be taught: <b>“He shall not go out with the army”? </b> The Talmud answers: The Torah adds this clause <b>so that he will violate two prohibitions</b> if he goes out to war: “He shall not go out with the army,” and: “Neither shall he be charged. ” |
| Deuteronomy 24:5 | built a house and dedicated it | Sotah 44a:9 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>These</b> are the men <b>who do not</b> even <b>move from their places: </b> One who <b>built a house and dedicated it</b> within the year; one who planted a vineyard and used its fruit for less than a year; one who marries his betrothed and one who marries his <i>yevama</i>, as it is stated: “When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken” (Deuteronomy 24:5). With respect to a new husband’s exemption, <b>A baraita states</b> a number of <i>halakhot</i> from this verse. From the term: <b>“A new wife” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a man returns only for <b>a new</b> virgin <b>wife. From where</b> do I derive that it applies to <b>a widow or a divorcée? The verse states: “A wife, ” in any case. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A new wife? ”</b> It is referring to <b>one who is new for him, excluding one who remarries his divorcée, who is not new to him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:6 | “He may not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral” | Bava Metzia113a:10 | <b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“He may not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). <b>But</b> it may be inferred that <b>other items</b> may be <b>taken as collateral. </b> Similarly, it states: <b>“You may not take a widow’s garment as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17), <b>but</b> clothing that <b>belongs to others you may take as collateral. </b> The Talmud analyzes these statements: <b>Who</b> is permitted to do so? <b>If we say</b> that <b>the creditor</b> may take these items, that cannot be, as it <b>is written: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>the agent of the court, </b> which indicates that the agent of the court may enter the debtor’s house and take collateral, although the Torah places limits on which item he can take? |
| Deuteronomy 24:6 | as it is stated: “He shall not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral” | Bava Metzia115a:15 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> One <b>who takes a millstone as collateral violates a prohibition, and</b> he is <b>liable for</b> taking <b>two vessels, </b> i.e., both millstones in the pair, <b>as it is stated: “He shall not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). The <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>Not only</b> did the rabbis <b>say</b> that it is prohibited to take <b>the lower or upper millstone</b> as collateral, <b>but</b> they also said that one may not take <b>anything that</b> people <b>use in the preparation of food [<i>okhel nefesh</i>], as it is stated: “For he takes a man’s life [<i>nefesh</i>] as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). |
| Deuteronomy 24:6 | “For he takes a man’s life as collateral” | Bava Metzia115b:5 | The Talmud responds: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: I state</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, </b> as there is a difference between the two cases: <b>Rav Yehuda states</b> his opinion <b>only there, </b> with regard to collateral, <b>because</b> the phrase: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6), <b>does not</b> itself <b>indicate</b> that the verse is referring to <b>the lower and upper millstones. </b> Rather, it is a general statement, and <b>therefore it comes to</b> teach <b>about</b> the prohibition <b>against</b> taking as collateral <b>other items</b> used in the preparation of food, not to add a prohibition to take as collateral the lower and upper millstones. |
| Deuteronomy 24:7 | and he exploited him and sold him, | Sanhedrin 85b:18 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>One who abducts a Jewish person is not liable</b> to be executed <b>unless he brings</b> the abductee <b>into his domain. R' Yehuda says: </b> He is not liable <b>unless he brings him into his domain and exploits him, as it is stated: </b> “If a man shall be found abducting a person of his brethren from the children of Israel, <b>and he exploited him and sold him, </b> then that abductor shall die” (Deuteronomy 24:7). The phrase “exploited him” indicates using him for labor. With regard to <b>one who abducts his</b> own <b>son</b> and sells him, <b>R' Yishmael ben Yoḥanan ben Beroka, deems</b> him <b>liable, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. </b> If <b>one abducted one who is a half-slave half-freeman, </b> i.e., a Canaanite slave who belonged to two owners and was emancipated by one of them, <b>R' Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:7 | “If a man shall be found abducting a person of his brethren | Sanhedrin 85b:22 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“If a man shall be found abducting a person of his brethren</b> from the children of Israel, and he exploited him and sold him, then that abductor shall die” (Deuteronomy 24:7). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man who abducted</b> another is liable. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman</b> who abducts another is liable as well? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: And one who abducts a man, </b> and sells him, if he be found in his hand, he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16), where the sex of the abductor is not specified. |
| Deuteronomy 24:7 | states: “Then that abductor shall die” | Sanhedrin 85b:23 | <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man who abducted</b> another, <b>whether a man or a woman, </b> is liable, as it is written: “If a man shall be found abducting a person”; the abductor is male but the sex of the abductee is not specified. <b>And</b> I derived that <b>a woman who abducted a man</b> is liable, as it is written: “And one who abducts a man”; the sex of the abductor is not specified but the abductee is male. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman who abducted a woman</b> is liable as well? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “Then that abductor shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:7); the abductor shall die <b>in any case, </b> regardless of the sex of the one who was abducted. |
| Deuteronomy 24:7 | shall be found | Sanhedrin 86a:5 | <b>Abaye said: </b> It is derived <b>from the verse</b> that <b>states: “If</b> a man <b>shall be found</b> abducting a person of his brethren” (Deuteronomy 24:7), to <b>exclude</b> one who is already <b>found</b> in the custody of the abductor before the abduction. Since the son is already in the custody of his father, the father is not liable for abducting him. |
| Deuteronomy 24:8 | and its prohibition is from here: “Take heed of the plague of leprosy” | Makkot 22a:7 | <b>R' Abbahu objects to this: And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also enumerate one who severs his snow-white leprous mark</b> in the course of his plowing, <b>and its prohibition is from here: “Take heed of the plague of tzara'at”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:8), indicating the prohibition against severing the mark. |
| Deuteronomy 24:8 | “Take care with regard to the plague of leprosy | Shabbat 132b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And on the 8th day <b>the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), since this verse is stated in general terms, it teaches that <b>even though there is a bright white</b> leprous <b>spot there, he should cut it. And how do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“Take care with regard to the plague of tzara'at</b> to take great care and to perform in accordance with all that the priests, the Levites, instruct you; as I commanded them you shall take care to perform” (Deuteronomy 24:8)? Does usage of the term “take care” indicate that there is a negative mitzva that prohibits cutting off symptoms of tzara'at? We establish this prohibition as applying <b>in other places, other than</b> the place of a <b>circumcision. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:8 | “Take heed with regard to the plague of leprosy that you observe diligently and do | Shabbat 133a:4 | <b>Some teach that which Abaye and Rava</b> said as referring <b>to this</b> <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“Take heed with regard to the plague of tzara'at that you observe diligently and do</b> in accordance with all that the priests, the Levites, instruct you; as I commanded them you shall take care to do” (Deuteronomy 24:8). The rabbis derived from here that <b>to do</b> something in order to remove tzara'at directly, <b>you may not do; but you may do</b> something that will indirectly remove one’s symptom, such as tying <b>a thick rope on his foot, and</b> placing <b>a rod on his shoulder. </b> This is permitted even though there is a bright white spot present, <b>and if</b> the bright white spot <b>is</b> thereby <b>removed, it is removed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:8 | violates a prohibition, | Shabbat 94b:3 | <b>We learned there</b> in a Mishnah discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of tzara'at: <b>One who plucks</b> white hairs that are <b>signs of impurity, and</b> similarly <b>one who burned the unaffected skin</b> in the midst of a leprous sore in an attempt to purify himself, <b>violates a prohibition, </b> as it is stated: “Take heed [<i>hishamer</i>] in the plague of tzara'at” (Deuteronomy 24:8). This ruling is based on the principle that the term <i>hishamer</i> indicates a prohibition. On this topic, <b>it was stated: </b> With regard to one who plucks <b>one of two</b> white hairs, everyone agrees that he is <b>liable</b> because a single hair remains, which is less than the measure that determines impurity, i.e., two hairs. It is with regard to one who plucks <b>one of three</b> white hairs that there is a dispute between the <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> He is <b>liable. Rav Sheshet said: </b> He is <b>exempt. </b> The Talmud elaborates. <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> He is <b>liable</b> because <b>his actions were effective, as if another</b> hair <b>is removed, </b> the <b>impurity would cease. </b> He thereby hastened his purification and is in violation of the prohibition. <b>Rav Sheshet said: </b> He is <b>exempt</b> because his actions were ineffective, as <b>now, in any case, the impurity is</b> intact even after he removed one hair. His act is ineffective, and therefore he does not violate the prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 24:8 | Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition. | Shevuot 4a:6 | The Talmud clarifies: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the Mishnah? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yishmael, and</b> it is referring to liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes. </b> The Talmud questions this: But in the parallel case of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, what</b> punishment of <b>lashes is there? </b> The Talmud answers: There is a punishment of lashes in a case <b>where one cuts off his snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>], and in accordance with</b> the principle that <b>R' Avin says</b> that <b>R' Ile’a</b> says, <b>as R' Avin says</b> that <b>R' Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated: Observe, </b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition. </b> So too, with regard to tzara'at, the verse states: “Observe the leprous mark” (Deuteronomy 24:8), which according to R' Ile’a’s principle teaches a prohibition, namely that it is prohibited to remove the mark. Accordingly, one who violates this prohibition is liable to receive lashes. |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | is written: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral” | Bava Metzia113a:10 | <b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“He may not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). <b>But</b> it may be inferred that <b>other items</b> may be <b>taken as collateral. </b> Similarly, it states: <b>“You may not take a widow’s garment as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17), <b>but</b> clothing that <b>belongs to others you may take as collateral. </b> The Talmud analyzes these statements: <b>Who</b> is permitted to do so? <b>If we say</b> that <b>the creditor</b> may take these items, that cannot be, as it <b>is written: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>the agent of the court, </b> which indicates that the agent of the court may enter the debtor’s house and take collateral, although the Torah places limits on which item he can take? |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | only to a creditor? When it says: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral” | Bava Metzia113b:2 | The Talmud attempts a further proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which A baraita states: The verse states: <b>“If you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment, </b> you shall restore it to him until the sun goes down” (Exodus 22:25). <b>The verse is speaking of an agent of the court. </b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>the verse is speaking of an agent of the court, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> referring <b>only to a creditor? When it says: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), the case of <b>a creditor is thereby stated. How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“If you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment”? The verse is speaking of an agent of the court. </b> This indicates that an agent of the court has permission to take collateral. |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | you shall not go into his house to take his collateral” | Bava Metzia115a:4 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> The verse states: “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). This verse indicates that <b>you may not enter his house, but you</b> may <b>enter the house of a guarantor</b> to take collateral from him. <b>And similarly it states: “Take his garment that is a surety for a stranger”</b> (Proverbs 20:16). |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | the verse states: “Any manner | Bava Metzia115a:7 | The verse “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall not go into his house to take his collateral” can be interpreted <b>in a different direction, </b> i.e., in another manner: <b>You may not enter his house</b> to take collateral for the loan, <b>but</b> if he owes wages, <b>you may enter</b> and take collateral <b>for a porter’s wages, for a donkey driver’s wages, for an innkeeper’s payment, </b> or <b>for the wages for</b> one who made <b>drawings [<i>diyokanaot</i>]</b> for him. One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if the one owed the money <b>establishes it as a loan for</b> the one who owes the money after he was already liable for such payment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Any manner</b> of loan” (Deuteronomy 24:10), which demonstrates that once the debt has been converted into a loan, it is like any other loan, and therefore one may not take collateral against the debtor’s will. |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | collateral, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not come into his house to fetch his pledge” | Makkot 16a:16 | The Talmud questions R' Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva for which one is flogged? <b>But aren’t there others? </b> Before stating its challenges, the Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases that it will cite: <b>Robbery, collateral, and <i>pe’a</i>. </b> The Talmud elaborates: Isn’t there the case of <b>robbery, where God states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and also states: <b>“And he shall return the stolen item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23)? Isn’t there the case of <b>collateral, where God states: “You shall not come into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), and He then states: <b>“You shall return to him the pledge when the sun sets”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13)? |
| Deuteronomy 24:10 | you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge” | Temurah 6a:6 | The Talmud objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>collateral, </b> with regard to <b>which God states: </b> “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), teaching that a creditor may not seize collateral if the debtor delays payment. <b>And we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 113a): If the creditor nevertheless seized two items as collateral, <b>he returns a mattress by night, </b> as the debtor requires it for sleeping, <b>and a plow, </b> which is needed for his daytime work, <b>by day. </b> The creditor may keep possession of seized collateral when it is not being used, which is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:11 | as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man you have a claim against will bring his collateral out to you” | Bava Kamma8a:9 | <b>Ravina said: </b> Another resolution to the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> is that the <i>baraitot</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla says: By Torah law, a creditor</b> collects <b>from inferior-quality</b> land, <b>as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man you have a claim against will bring his collateral out to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:11). One can infer: <b>What</b> item would <b>a person typically</b> choose <b>to bring out</b> for use as collateral and potential payment? Certainly it is the <b>most inferior of his utensils. </b> The verse thereby indicates that a creditor collects from inferior-quality land. <b>But</b> if so, for <b>what reason</b> did the rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor</b> collects <b>from intermediate-quality</b> land? They instituted this ordinance <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers, </b> as, if creditors were limited to collecting from inferior-quality land they would be hesitant to offer loans in the first place. |
| Deuteronomy 24:11 | is stated: “You shall stand outside,” do I not know that: “And the man to whom you lend shall bring forth outside” | Bava Metzia113a:12 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different <i>baraita</i> that contradicts Shmuel: <b>From the implication of that</b> which <b>is stated: “You shall stand outside, ” do I not know that: “And the man to whom you lend shall bring forth outside”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:11)? <b>Rather, why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the inclusive phrase <b>“And the man</b> to whom you lend shall bring forth outside”? This serves <b>to include the agent of the court. </b> The Talmud comments: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>the agent of the court</b> has the same status <b>as the debtor</b> himself, indicating that just as the debtor may enter his own house at any time, the court agent may act likewise? |
| Deuteronomy 24:11 | collateral to him, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man | Bava Metzia113b:3 | The Talmud responds: This issue <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An agent of the court who comes to take collateral</b> from a debtor may <b>not enter his house to take the collateral from him. Rather, </b> the agent <b>stands outside and the other, </b> i.e., the debtor, <b>brings out</b> the <b>collateral to him, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man</b> to whom you lend shall bring forth the collateral” (Deuteronomy 24:11). According to this <i>tanna</i>, the agent of the court has the same status as the creditor. |
| Deuteronomy 24:11 | enters and brings out the collateral to him, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, | Bava Metzia113b:4 | <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A creditor who comes to take collateral from</b> the debtor <b>may not enter his house to take his collateral. Rather, </b> he <b>stands outside, and the other, </b> i.e., the debtor, <b>enters and brings out the collateral to him, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, </b> and the man to whom you lend shall bring forth the collateral” (Deuteronomy 24:11). <b>But</b> as for <b>an agent of the court who comes to take collateral from</b> the debtor, <b>this</b> agent <b>may enter his house and take his collateral. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:11 | from inferior-quality land, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man | Gittin 50a:7 | <b>Rava said to him: How can</b> these two cases <b>be compared? By Torah law, </b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> governing <b>a creditor</b> is that he collects <b>from inferior-quality land, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla, as Ulla says: By Torah law, a creditor</b> collects <b>from inferior-quality land, as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man</b> to whom you have lent shall bring forth the pledge out to you” (Deuteronomy 24:11). <b>What would a man ordinarily take out</b> as a pledge? <b>The least</b> valuable <b>of</b> his <b>vessels. </b> This demonstrates that the creditor is entitled only to the least valuable of the debtor’s vessels. Similarly, when he collects from land, he collects only from inferior-quality land. <b>And for what reason did</b> the rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor</b> collects <b>from intermediate-quality land? So as not to lock the door before</b> potential <b>borrowers, </b> i.e., so that people do not refrain from extending loans. <b>And with regard to orphans, the rabbis left</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> it is stated <b>in the Torah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:12 | “If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his collateral” | Bava Metzia114b:5 | § <b>A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:12), <b>but</b> if he is <b>wealthy, </b> one may <b>lie down. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying? Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying: And if he be a poor man, you shall not sleep while his collateral is with you; </b> rather, you must restore it to him before the sun sets. <b>But</b> if he is <b>a wealthy</b> man, you may <b>lie down while his collateral is with you. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | whereas I am storing up for myself, as it is stated: “And it shall be as righteousness to you” | Bava Batra11a:4 | <b>My ancestors stored up something that does not generate profit, </b> as money sitting in a treasury does not increase, <b>whereas I am storing up something that generates profit, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous, that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>My ancestors stored up treasures of money, whereas I am storing up treasures of souls, as it is stated: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise”</b> (Proverbs 11:30). <b>My ancestors stored up for others, </b> for their sons and heirs, when they themselves would pass from this world, <b>whereas I am storing up for myself, as it is stated: “And it shall be as righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>My ancestors stored up for this world, whereas I am storing up for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of YHWH shall be your rearguard”</b> (Isaiah 58:8). |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “And it shall be righteousness to you” | Bava Metzia114a:1 | <b>Indeed, </b> the debtor’s needs are <b>cast upon him, because it is stated</b> in connection with this same issue of returning the collateral: <b>“And it shall be righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), which indicates that there is an obligation for the creditor to act toward the debtor with righteousness. |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | and he will sleep in his garment and he will bless you” | Bava Metzia114a:8 | The Talmud asks an additional question: <b>And</b> once it is established that arrangements are not made for a debtor, <b>they should return</b> the collateral <b>in</b> the case of <b>consecration</b> based on <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a debtor: And if</b> in the case of <b>a debtor, where</b> they do <b>not make arrangements</b> for him, the creditor nevertheless <b>returns</b> his collateral, with regard to <b>consecration, where</b> they do <b>make arrangements</b> for the payment of his debt, <b>is it not logical that</b> they should <b>return</b> his collateral to him? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a regular loan: “You shall restore to him the collateral…<b>and he will sleep in his garment and he will bless you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), <b>excluding consecration, where</b> there is <b>no need</b> for <b>a blessing, </b> and therefore it is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of returning the collateral. |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “And it shall be righteousness [ tzedaka ] for you” | Bava Metzia114a:9 | The Talmud is puzzled by this claim: <b>And</b> is consecrated property <b>not</b> in need of a blessing? <b>But isn’t it written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless</b> YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), indicating that consecrated property also requires a blessing? <b>Rather, </b> the reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the restoration of collateral: <b>“And it shall be righteousness [<i>tzedaka</i>] for you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), which is referring to caring for <b>one who requires charity [<i>tzedaka</i>], excluding consecrated</b> property, <b>which</b> does <b>not require charity. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “You shall restore to him the collateral when the sun goes down” | Bava Metzia114b:8 | <b>Rav Sheizevi taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava: </b> With regard to the verse: “And if you take as collateral your neighbor’s garment, <b>you shall restore it to him until the sun goes down”</b> (Exodus 22:25), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a garment</b> worn at <b>night</b> and teaches that the garment is returned during the day; and with regard to the verse: <b>“You shall restore to him the collateral when the sun goes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a garment</b> worn during the <b>day. </b> Rava <b>said to him: </b> This statement is puzzling, as with regard to a garment worn <b>in the day, why do I</b> need it <b>at night, and</b> as for a garment worn <b>at night, why do I</b> need it <b>in the day? </b> What purpose is served by giving back the garments at such times? |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “You shall restore [ hashev tashiv ] | Bava Metzia31b:4 | With regard to an item that a poor person needs, e.g., a blanket, that a lender took as collateral when lending him money, it is written: <b>“You shall restore [<i>hashev tashiv</i>]</b> to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; and it shall be righteousness for you before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to return his garment each night in a case where the lender <b>took collateral with the sanction of the court. From where</b> do I derive the obligation to return his garment each night even in a case where the lender <b>took collateral without the sanction of the court? The verse states: “<i>Hashev tashiv</i>, ”</b> to teach that he must return it <b>in any case. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “And it shall be righteousness for you” | Gittin 37a:16 | Rava <b>said to him: Collateral is different, as</b> the creditor <b>acquires it</b> for himself, as learned <b>from</b> the statement <b>of R' Yitzḥak, as R' Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him and is considered its owner so long as the item is in his possession? <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse with regard to the obligation of a creditor to return collateral at night: <b>“And it shall be righteousness for you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). R' Yitzḥak infers: <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire</b> the collateral, then <b>from where</b> is the <b>righteousness</b> involved in returning it? He would be simply returning an item to its rightful owner. <b>From here</b> it is learned <b>that a creditor acquires the collateral. </b> Therefore, when he returns the collateral to the debtor he is performing an act of charity. |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | and it shall be righteousness to you” | Kiddushin 8b:2 | <b>As R' Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral, </b> i.e., that the individual in possession of the collateral has the actual rights to it? <b>As it is stated: </b> “You shall surely restore him the pledge when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire</b> the pledge or collateral, <b>from where</b> does this considering his return of the collateral as <b>righteousness</b> stem? The creditor is not giving an item belonging to him; why is this considered a righteous act? Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> to a certain extent. |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “You shall return to him the pledge when the sun sets” | Makkot 16a:16 | The Talmud questions R' Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva for which one is flogged? <b>But aren’t there others? </b> Before stating its challenges, the Talmud provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases that it will cite: <b>Robbery, collateral, and <i>pe’a</i>. </b> The Talmud elaborates: Isn’t there the case of <b>robbery, where God states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and also states: <b>“And he shall return the stolen item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23)?

| Deuteronomy 24:13 | and it shall be a righteousness for you | Pesachim 31b:1 | <b>Rather, with what are we dealing here? </b> With a situation <b>where he, </b> the non-Jew debtor, <b>deposited</b> the leavened bread that was serving as collateral <b>with him, </b> the Jewish creditor, <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of R' Yitzḥak. As R' Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him, and is considered its owner so long as the item is in his possession? <b>As it is stated: </b> “You shall surely return the pledge to him when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be a righteousness for you</b> before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 24:13). R' Yitzḥak infers: <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire the collateral, </b> then <b>from where is the righteousness</b> involved in returning it? In this case, the creditor would not be giving up anything of his own. <b>From here</b> it is learned <b>that a creditor acquires the collateral. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:13 | “And it shall be a righteousness for you” | Shevuot 44a:2 | The Talmud rejects this suggestion: <b>No, in</b> a case <b>where</b> the collateral was <b>not worth</b> the value of the loan <b>everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel.

As R' Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him and is considered its owner as long as the item is in his possession? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a creditor who returns the collateral to the debtor for his personal use: <b>“And it shall be a righteousness for you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). |
| Deuteronomy 24:14 | “From your brothers” | Bava Metzia111a:20 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the Mishnah? </b> It is <b>not</b> that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i> of</b> the <i>baraita</i>, who interprets the phrase: <b>“From your brothers”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and</b> it is <b>not R' Yosei ben Yehuda. </b> The Talmud clarifies: <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> that is referred to here? The Talmud explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: |
| Deuteronomy 24:14 | prohibition of: “You should not oppress a hired laborer who is poor” | Bava Metzia111a:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>From here</b> the rabbis <b>stated: Anyone who withholds the wages of a hired laborer violates these five</b> negative <b>prohibitions and</b> one <b>positive mitzva. </b> He <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition of: “You should not oppress a hired laborer who is poor”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> he has not fulfilled the positive mitzva <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> he has violated the prohibition <b>of: “The sun shall not set upon him”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). |
| Deuteronomy 24:14 | is derived from: “You shall not oppress a hired laborer who is poor and needy” | Bava Metzia111b:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, </b> who does not address <b>this</b> verse of: <b>“For he is poor, ” what</b> does he <b>do with it? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary to give precedence to a poor person over a wealthy person</b> if the employer does not have enough money to pay all his workers. <b>And</b> how does <b>R' Yosei ben Yehuda, </b> derive that <i>halakha</i>? In his opinion <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from: “You shall not oppress a hired laborer who is poor and needy”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14). |
| Deuteronomy 24:14 | withholds the wages of a hired laborer, it is explicitly written: “You shall not oppress a hired laborer who is poor and destitute” | Bava Metzia61a:17 | The Talmud challenges: <b>With regard to</b> one who <b>withholds the wages of a hired laborer, it is explicitly written: “You shall not oppress a hired laborer who is poor and destitute”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14). There is no need to derive this prohibition from the verse concerning robbery. The Talmud answers: It is written <b>so that</b> withholding the wages of a hired laborer always involves <b>violating two prohibitions. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | all day? As it is stated: “On the same day you shall give him his wages” | Bava Metzia110b:13 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning a day laborer that</b> he <b>collects</b> his wages <b>all night? The verse states: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). This indicates that he must pay him by the morning, and he has therefore not transgressed the prohibition of delaying the payment of wages until that time. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>concerning a night laborer that</b> he <b>collects</b> his wages <b>all day? As it is stated: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages” | Bava Metzia111a:17 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>Whether</b> referring to <b>a person’s wages</b> that he receives <b>or the renting of an animal or the renting of utensils, </b> are all <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). <b>When</b> does he transgress these prohibitions? He transgresses them <b>when</b> the one owed the money <b>claimed</b> the payment from <b>him. </b> If he <b>did not claim</b> his payment from <b>him</b> the other <b>does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. <b>If</b> the one who owes the money <b>transferred his</b> payment by leaving instructions <b>with a storekeeper or with a money changer</b> to pay him, <b>he does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages” | Bava Metzia111a:9 | The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>From here</b> the rabbis <b>stated: Anyone who withholds the wages of a hired laborer violates these five</b> negative <b>prohibitions and</b> one <b>positive mitzva. </b> He <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition of: “You should not oppress a hired laborer who is poor”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> he has not fulfilled the positive mitzva <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> he has violated the prohibition <b>of: “The sun shall not set upon him”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | “For he sets his soul upon it” | Bava Metzia111b:17 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“For he sets his soul upon it”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). This indicates that one is liable for delaying the payment of wages due for any work; as a laborer obligates himself to perform the work, it is <b>something for which he gives his soul. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages” | Bava Metzia111b:3 | <b>From here</b> the rabbis <b>stated: Whether</b> referring to <b>the hire of a person or the rental of an animal or the rental of utensils, </b> all are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and they are</b> likewise <b>subject to the prohibition of delaying</b> the payment of wages of a <b>hired laborer</b> (Leviticus 19:13). <b>R' Yosei ben Yehuda, says: </b> One who hires <b>a <i>ger toshav</i> is subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages, ” but is not subject to the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages, and the payment of rent of <b>an animal or vessels is included only in</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress” alone. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | and the sun shall not set upon him, for he is poor” | Bava Metzia111b:7 | The Talmud challenges: <b>Although</b> R' Yosei ben Yehuda, does <b>not derive</b> the verbal analogy of the words: <b>“Hired laborer”</b> and <b>“hired laborer, ”</b> one <b>should</b> still <b>also be liable</b> in the case of <b>animals or vessels due to</b> the injunction <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages. ”</b> From where does he derive that such items are not included in this prohibition? <b>R' Ḥananya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the verse states: </b> “On his day you shall give him his wages, <b>and the sun shall not set upon him, for he is poor”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). This verse clearly is referring to <b>one who</b> can <b>enter into</b> a state of <b>poverty and wealth, </b> which <b>excludes animals and vessels, which cannot enter into</b> a state of <b>poverty and wealth. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:15 | and the sun shall not go down [ tavo ] upon it” | Bava Metzia87b:17 | The Talmud answers that <b>Rava said: </b> This verse is required <b>for its</b> unique <b><i>halakhot</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“when you come [<i>tavo</i>]”</b> is interpreted as follows: <b>Coming [<i>bia</i>] is stated here, and coming is also stated there: </b> “In the same day you shall give him his wages, <b>and the sun shall not go down [<i>tavo</i>] upon it”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15). <b>Just as there, </b> in Deuteronomy, chapter 24, <b>the verse is speaking of a laborer, so too here, </b> in Deuteronomy, chapter 23, <b>the verse is speaking of a laborer, </b> despite the fact that this detail is not stated explicitly in the verse. |
| Deuteronomy 24:16 | The verse states: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children” | Bava Kamma88a:14 | <b>Mar, son of Ravina, said</b> another derivation. <b>The verse states: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:16), meaning that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>fathers who do not have</b> common <b>lineage [<i>ḥayis</i>] with</b> their <b>children. </b> This is referring to Canaanite slaves, whose children are not considered to be related to them. <b>For if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to interpret the verse according to its straightforward meaning, <b>as we say: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children, ”</b> meaning <b>by the testimony of</b> their <b>children, </b> then <b>let God write: Fathers shall not be put to death for their children. What</b> does the verse teach by stating only: <b>“Children, ”</b> without the word their? <b>Learn from</b> this formulation <b>that</b> people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>fathers who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>children. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:16 | “Nor shall children be put to death for fathers” | Bava Kamma88a:15 | The Talmud challenges this: <b>If that is so, </b> when the end of the verse states: <b>“Nor shall children be put to death for fathers”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:16), does this <b>also</b> mean that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>children who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>fathers? But</b> if that were the case, it would <b>also</b> be the case that <b>a convert</b> would be <b>disqualified from bearing witness, </b> as one who converts no longer shares common lineage with his parents. |
| Deuteronomy 24:16 | and children shall not be put to death for the fathers; | Berakhot 7a:26 | The Talmud expands upon these righteous and wicked individuals: <b>The Master said: The righteous</b> person <b>who prospers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a righteous</b> person. <b>The righteous</b> person <b>who suffers is a righteous</b> person, <b>the son of a wicked</b> person. The Talmud asks: <b>Is it so</b> that one is always punished for his ancestors’ transgressions? <b>Isn’t it written: “He visits iniquity of the fathers upon the children, </b> and upon the children’s children, unto the 3rd and 4th generations” (Exodus 34:7). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: “Fathers shall not die for their children, <b>and children shall not be put to death for the fathers; </b> every man shall die for his own transgression” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>And</b> the Talmud <b>raises a contradiction between the two verses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:16 | “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, | Sanhedrin 27b:14 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>From where is this matter, </b> that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness, derived? The Talmud answers: It is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, </b> neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this first clause? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the fathers shall not be put to death for the sin of the children, nor</b> shall <b>the children</b> be put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers, </b> this is unnecessary, as <b>it is in any event stated: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:16 | But isn’t it written: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children; | Yevamot 79a:7 | The Talmud raises a difficulty with regard to the story as related by the Bible: <b>But isn’t it written: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children; </b> neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers” (Deuteronomy 24:16)? As Saul’s sons had not sinned, why were they put to death? <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> It is <b>better that one letter</b> and one mitzva <b>be uprooted from the Torah</b> in this manner and thereby the <b>name of Heaven not be desecrated in public [<i>parhesya</i>]. </b> The killing of the Gibeonites by the Jewish people constituted a desecration of God’s name. In order to repair the damage, David acquiesced to the Gibeonites’ demands, even though they contradicted Torah law. |
| Deuteronomy 24:17 | “You may not take a widow’s garment as collateral” | Bava Metzia113a:10 | <b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“He may not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). <b>But</b> it may be inferred that <b>other items</b> may be <b>taken as collateral. </b> Similarly, it states: <b>“You may not take a widow’s garment as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17), <b>but</b> clothing that <b>belongs to others you may take as collateral. </b> The Talmud analyzes these statements: <b>Who</b> is permitted to do so? <b>If we say</b> that <b>the creditor</b> may take these items, that cannot be, as it <b>is written: “You shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>the agent of the court, </b> which indicates that the agent of the court may enter the debtor’s house and take collateral, although the Torah places limits on which item he can take? |
| Deuteronomy 24:17 | may not take collateral from her, as it is stated: “And you may not take the garment of a widow as collateral” | Bava Metzia115a:8 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> With regard to <b>a widow, whether she is poor</b> or <b>whether she is wealthy, </b> one <b>may not take collateral from her, as it is stated: “And you may not take the garment of a widow as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17). |
| Deuteronomy 24:17 | as it is stated: “You may not take the garment of a widow for a pledge” | Sanhedrin 21a:5 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 10:3): In the case of <b>a widow, whether she is poor or whether she is wealthy, one may not take collateral from her</b> for a loan, <b>as it is stated: “You may not take the garment of a widow for a pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17); this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. R' Shimon says: </b> In the case of <b>a wealthy</b> widow, one may <b>take collateral from her. </b> But in the case of <b>a poor</b> widow, <b>one may not take collateral from her, </b> because <b>you</b> are <b>obligated to return</b> it <b>to her, and you</b> will <b>give her a bad name among her neighbors. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, | Bava Metzia11a:10 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is a case where a landowner <b>was standing in the town and saying: I know that</b> my <b>laborers forgot a sheaf that I have in the field, </b> which I had intended for the laborers to bring in, but since I remember it, <b>it shall not be</b> considered <b>a forgotten</b> sheaf, which must be left for the poor. Then, the landowner himself forgot about the sheaf. In this case, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that it is not</b> considered <b>a forgotten</b> sheaf. To counter this, <b>the verse states: </b> “When you reap your harvest in your field, <b>and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, </b> you shall not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:19). It is derived from here that the phrase: <b>“And have forgotten”</b> applies <b>“in the field, ” but not in the town. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | the verse states: “You shall not go back to take it” | Bava Metzia11a:15 | The Talmud responds that <b>the verse states: “You shall not go back to take it”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19), which is interpreted <b>to include</b> sheaves <b>forgotten</b> while the owner is in <b>the town. </b> Evidently, there is no fundamental difference between a town and the field with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of forgotten sheaves; rather, the distinction is due to the fact that one cannot acquire a sheaf by means of his courtyard if he is not standing next to the courtyard. |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | The verse states: “It shall be” | Bava Metzia11a:20 | <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the inclusion of this case is derived from another phrase in the verse. <b>The verse states: “It shall be”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19), which is interpreted <b>to include</b> sheaves <b>forgotten</b> while the owner is in <b>the town. </b> Therefore, the Talmud’s initial interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is accepted, leading to the conclusion that the distinction between a case where the owner is in the field and a case where he is in the town is due to the <i>halakha</i> that one’s courtyard can effect acquisition of property for him only if he is next to the courtyard, as Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel. |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | “When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, | Chullin 131b:1 | <b>and the forgotten</b> sheaves, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>. As it is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of [<i>pe’at</i>] your field, </b> neither shall you gather <b>the gleaning of your harvest; </b> you shall leave them for the poor, and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). And it is also written: <b>“When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, </b> you shall not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:19). |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | you shall not return | Chullin 141b:2 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> by <b>R' Oshaya and R' Ḥiyya: </b> It is written with regard to forgotten sheaves left for the poor: “When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, <b>you shall not return</b> to fetch it” (Deuteronomy 24:19). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and</b> one <b>returned</b> to fetch it, he is liable to receive lashes. Likewise, it is written with regard to produce in the corner of the field [<i>pe’a</i>], which is given to the poor: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, <b>you shall not wholly reap</b> the corner of your field” (Leviticus 19:9). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and reaped</b> the corner of his field, such individuals <b>are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | forgotten | Sotah 43b:17 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov: </b> With regard to <b>gleanings</b> (Leviticus 19:9, 23:22), <b>forgotten</b> sheaves (Deuteronomy 24:19), <b>or produce in the corner of the field which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> (Leviticus 19:9, 23:22), three obligatory agricultural gifts that must be given to the poor, if one <b>gathered them into the threshing floor, </b> the produce <b>was</b> thereby <b>rendered</b> obligated <b>for tithes. </b> Although one does not take tithes from produce for the poor, onlookers are likely to presume that this is his own produce. <b>Ulla said: We stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> when the granary is <b>in the field, but in the city, the matter</b> generates <b>publicity. </b> People see that the produce was gathered in small quantities from different places, and they know that this produce is for the poor. In that case, one need not separate tithes. |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | “And you forget a sheaf in the field” | Sotah 45a:10 | § The Mishnah teaches: If the corpse <b>was found concealed in a pile</b> of stones <b>or hanging on a tree, </b> they would not perform the ritual of the heifer. The Talmud suggests: <b>Let us say that the Mishnah is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. </b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that sheaves of grain forgotten in the fields must be left for the poor: <b>“And you forget a sheaf in the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This <b>excludes a concealed</b> sheaf; it is not considered forgotten and it may be collected by the owner, even if he did forget it. This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: </b> The phrase <b>“in the field”</b> serves <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves, and these must be left for the poor. R' Yehuda holds, like the ruling in the Mishnah here, that when the verse states “in the field” it excludes a concealed corpse. |
| Deuteronomy 24:19 | based on the context of the verse, as it is written: “When you reap your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf” | Sotah 45a:12 | In this case, <b>as it is written: “If one be found slain”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), the default assumption is that the <i>halakha</i> applies no matter <b>where it is found. </b> When the verse then states: <b>“In the ground, ”</b> it must be serving to <b>exclude</b> a matter, i.e., <b>a concealed</b> corpse. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>there, </b> in the case of forgotten sheaves, they also expound <b>based on the context of the verse, as it is written: “When you reap your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This indicates that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest: Just as</b> the <b>harvest</b> is performed <b>with revealed</b> objects, i.e., the growing grain, <b>so too, </b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>forgetting</b> pertain <b>to revealed</b> sheaves. Consequently, when <b>God writes</b> in the Torah <b>“in the field, ”</b> it must be in order <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves. |
| Deuteronomy 24:20 | As it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [ tefa’er ] after you; | Chullin 131a:16 | The <i>halakha</i> that the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i></b> applies to one’s vineyard is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>“after you”</b> in that verse and the term <b>“after you” from</b> another verse concerning <b>an olive</b> tree. <b>As it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [<i>tefa’er</i>] after you; </b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:20); <b>and the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> that the term “You shall not go over the boughs” means <b>that you should not take</b> all of <b>its splendor [<i>tiferet</i>] from it; </b> rather, you should leave a portion of the olives for the poor. So too, one must leave a portion of one’s vineyard as <i>pe’a</i> for the poor. |
| Deuteronomy 24:20 | and the pe’a , as it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [ tefa’er ] after you; | Chullin 131b:2 | The <i>baraita</i> taught that <b>two</b> gifts are left to the poor <b>from</b> the produce <b>of a tree: The forgotten</b> fruits <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>, as it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [<i>tefa’er</i>] after you; </b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:20), <b>and the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> that the phrase: “You shall not go over the boughs,” means <b>that you should not take</b> all of <b>its splendor [<i>tiferet</i>] from it; </b> rather, you should leave a portion of the olives for the poor as <i>pe’a</i>. Additionally, when the verse states: <b>“After you, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>forgotten</b> fruits. |
| Deuteronomy 24:21 | written: “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it [ te’olel ] after you; | Chullin 131a:15 | <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it [<i>te’olel</i>] after you; </b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:21). And <b>R' Levi says</b> that with regard to the term <b>“after you, ” this</b> is a reference to <b>forgotten</b> clusters, as the <i>halakha</i> is that clusters that were passed over by the harvester have the status of forgotten clusters, whereas those that remain in front of him do not have that status. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | according to the measure of his evildoing” | Bava Kamma83b:17 | The Talmud challenges this claim: <b>But is this</b> verse: <b>“You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, ” coming to exclude</b> the case of one who severs another’s <b>extremities</b> from the prohibition against taking ransom? Isn’t <b>this</b> verse <b>necessary</b> to teach that <b>which God states: You shall not mete out two</b> punishments <b>to him; </b> i.e., <b>do not take money from him</b> as ransom <b>and</b> also <b>kill him? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: “Then it shall be, if the guilty deserves to be lashed, that the judge shall lie him down and flog him before him, <b>according to the measure of his evildoing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). From the fact that “evildoing” is singular, the Talmud homiletically infers: For <b>one evildoing, you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable</b> for <b>two evildoings, </b> i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | guilty | Bava Kamma86b:22 | Why did R' Yehuda deem a blind person exempt from being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes? </b> That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy to: “Then it shall be, if the <b>guilty</b> one deserves to be beaten” (Deuteronomy 25:2), written with regard to lashes, <b>from: </b> “Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is <b>guilty</b> of death” (Numbers 35:31), written with regard to <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | according to the measure of his wickedness” | Ketubot 32b:3 | The Talmud observes: <b>Apparently, R' Yoḥanan maintains</b> that in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes, and</b> the witnesses <b>forewarned him, he is flogged</b> but does not <b>pay money. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where does R' Yoḥanan</b> derive <b>this</b> principle? The Talmud explains that he derives it from that which <b>the verse states</b> with regard to one sentenced to lashes in the court: “The judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before him, <b>according to the measure of his wickedness”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), from which it is inferred: <b>For one</b> act of <b>wickedness, </b> i.e., punishment, <b>you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two</b> acts of <b>wickedness. And juxtaposed to</b> this it states: <b>“Forty he shall strike him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating that the punishment that is administered when one is liable to receive two punishments is lashes and not payment. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | “And it shall be if the wicked man deserves to be flogged” | Ketubot 33a:1 | The Talmud asks: Based on that reasoning, the same would hold true for <b>one who injures another as well; if so, </b> if he pays and is not lashed, <b>you have rendered moot</b> the prohibition “Forty he shall strike him; <b>he shall not exceed, lest if he should exceed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3). The same would hold true for <b>conspiring witnesses as well; if so, you have rendered moot</b> the verse interpreted as addressing the matter of conspiring witnesses: <b>“And it shall be if the wicked man deserves to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rather, </b> with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses, </b> that verse <b>can be fulfilled</b> in the case <b>of the son of a divorcée or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. </b> If witnesses testified that a priest is the son of a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i> and were discovered to be conspiring witnesses, there is no payment and they are flogged. With regard to <b>one who injures another as well, </b> the verse <b>can be fulfilled</b> in a case <b>where he struck him</b> with <b>a blow that</b> does <b>not</b> cause damage amounting to <b>the value of a <i>peruta</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | wicked | Ketubot 35a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>Where did</b> the <b>Torah include</b> those liable to be flogged? <b>Abaye said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to die” (Numbers 35:31), and the term <b>wicked</b> in the verse “That he is wicked and liable to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rava said: </b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>smites</b> in one verse and the term <b>smites</b> in another verse. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: </b> To <b>which</b> term <b>smites</b> are you referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is the verse <b>“And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), clearly that is not so, as <b>that is written with regard to death. </b> Smiting a person in that verse is referring to murder. <b>Rather, </b> it is to <b>this</b> term <b>smites</b> that Rava is referring: <b>“And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18), <b>and juxtaposed to it, </b> it is written: <b>“And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The verses liken those liable to receive lashes to those obligated to pay money, from which it is derived that those liable to receive lashes are exempt from payment. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | according to the measure of his iniquity” | Ketubot 37a:8 | § The Mishnah states that one liable to receive the death penalty is exempt from payment, <b>as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished, etc.”</b> (Exodus 21:22). The Talmud asks: <b>And is this</b> principle <b>derived from here? </b> Actually, <b>it is derived from there: </b> “And to be beaten before his face <b>according to the measure of his iniquity”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). From the term: His iniquity, it is inferred: <b>You can hold</b> one who performs one action <b>liable for one iniquity, </b> i.e., punishment for violating one prohibition, <b>but you do not hold him liable for two iniquities, </b> i.e., punishments for violating two prohibitions. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | “Then it shall be if the wicked man deserve [ bin ] to be flogged” | Ketubot 46a:5 | <b>R' Abbahu said: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>chastise</b> in the case of a defamer by verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>chastise</b> stated in the verse “if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son [<i>ben</i>], that will not listen to the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chastise him, will not listen to them” (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>chastise</b> in that verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>son</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>son [<i>ben</i>]</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the word <b><i>bin</i></b> in the verse <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserve [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | “According to the measure of his wickedness” | Makkot 13b:16 | The Talmud answers: <b>R' Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak received</b> a tradition <b>from</b> R' Abbahu that the reason those liable to receive <i>karet</i> are flogged and it is not considered two punishments for one transgression is that when the verse states: <b>“According to the measure of his wickedness”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), from which it is derived: <b>For one evildoing you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two evildoings, the verse is speaking with regard to an evildoing that is given to</b> the jurisdiction of <b>the court, </b> not to an act of wickedness punishable at the hand of Heaven. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | “And the judge shall cause him to lie down [ vehippilo ] and to be beaten before him” | Makkot 13b:4 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yishmael, </b> who holds that even those liable to be executed are liable to receive lashes? It is <b>as it is written: “If you will not observe to perform all the matters of this Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:58), <b>and it is written</b> immediately thereafter, with regard to the punishment of one who violates that verse: <b>“And God will make your plagues wondrous [<i>vehifla</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59). The rabbis interpreted that verse: <b>This</b> term, <b><i>hafla’a</i>, I do not know what its</b> meaning <b>is. When</b> the verse <b>states</b> concerning those liable to receive lashes: <b>“And the judge shall cause him to lie down [<i>vehippilo</i>] and to be beaten before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>you must say</b> that <b>this <i>hafla’a</i> is</b> a term referring to <b>lashes, and it is written</b> that this <i>hafla’a</i> is administered in any case where one does not fulfill the verse <b>“if you will not observe to perform all</b> the matters of this Torah,” including those prohibitions punishable by death. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | according to the measure of his wickedness” | Makkot 13b:9 | The Talmud continues its analysis of the opinions cited in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>R' Akiva, what is the reason</b> he maintains that those liable to be executed are not flogged? It is written: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before him, <b>according to the measure of his wickedness”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), from which it is derived with regard to one who commits one transgression: <b>For one evildoing you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two evildoings, </b> i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act. Therefore, execution suffices and he is not flogged. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | hunched, as it is stated: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down, | Makkot 22b:11 | <b>And</b> the attendant <b>flogs him</b> with <b>one-3rd</b> of the lashes <b>from the front of him, </b> on his chest, <b>and two</b> one-3rd <b>portions from behind him, </b> on his back. <b>And he does not flog him</b> when the one receiving lashes is <b>standing, nor</b> when he is <b>sitting; rather, </b> he flogs him when he is <b>hunched, as it is stated: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down, </b> and strike him” (Deuteronomy 25:2), which indicates that the one receiving lashes must be in a position that approximates lying down. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | as the verse states: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down, and strike him before him in accordance with his wickedness, by number” | Makkot 23a:8 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>One flogs him</b> with one-3rd of the lashes from the front of him and two one-3rd portions from behind him. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Kahana said: </b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down, and strike him before him in accordance with his wickedness, by number”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), indicating that the attendant strikes him in accordance with <b>one</b> portion of <b>wickedness from the front of him, </b> and <b>two</b> portions of <b>wickedness from behind him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | according to the measure of his wickedness” | Makkot 4b:1 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the initial dispute between R' Meir and the Rabbis in the Mishnah whether conspiring witnesses pay and are flogged, the Talmud asks: <b>Granted, </b> according <b>to the Rabbis, </b> the verse that states: “The judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before him, <b>according to the measure of his wickedness”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>is written</b> concerning one who was liable to receive lashes. From “according to the measure of his wickedness” it is inferred with regard to an individual who commits one transgression: <b>For one evildoing you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two evildoings, </b> i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act. <b>But</b> according to <b>R' Meir, what is the reason</b> that he is punished twice for committing a single transgression? |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | Abaye said: “Wicked” | Makkot 5a:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that the witnesses do not divide the punishment of lashes among themselves, derived? <b>Abaye said: “Wicked”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>is stated with regard to those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and: “Wicked”</b> (Numbers 35:31), <b>is stated with regard to those liable</b> to receive <b>a court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalty. <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to those sentenced to be executed, <b>there is no partial death</b> penalty, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to those liable to receive lashes, <b>there is no partial</b> administering of <b>lashes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | wicked | Makkot 5b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that one does not administer punishment to <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes</b> based on an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, and that the principle is not limited to capital punishment? <b>The verse states</b> a verbal analogy between the term “wicked” written with regard to those liable to be executed and the term “wicked” written with regard to those liable to receive lashes. With regard to those liable to be executed, it is written: “Who is <b>wicked</b> and deserves to die” (Numbers 35:31). With regard to those liable to receive lashes, it is written: “And it shall be if the <b>wicked</b> is deserving of lashes” (Deuteronomy 25:2). |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | “Then it shall be if the wicked man deserves [ bin ] to be flogged” | Sanhedrin 71b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>Where is it written</b> that <b>lashes</b> are administered <b>to a stubborn and rebellious son? </b> There is no explicit mention of lashes in the verse. The Talmud answers: It is <b>as R' Abbahu</b> said in another context, <b>as R' Abbahu says: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> as stated with regard to a defamer: “And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him” (Deuteronomy 22:18), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“chastise”</b> stated with regard to a rebellious son (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“chastise”</b> in the latter verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“son”</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the meaning of the word <b>“son [<i>ben</i>]”</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the similar word <b>“<i>bin</i>”</b> stated with regard to lashes: <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserves [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). Consequently, the chastisement mentioned with regard to both a defamer and a rebellious son involves flogging. |
| Deuteronomy 25:2 | is. When it says: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down [ vehippilo ] and to be beaten before him” | Temurah 3b:15 | § R' Yosei HaGelili also lists <b>one who curses another using the name</b> of God as liable to be flogged. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>R' Elazar says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: The verse states: “If you will not observe</b> to perform all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 28:58). This refers to one who curses using the name of God. <b>And it is written</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“Then YHWH will make your plagues wondrous [<i>vehifla</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59). With regard to <b>this</b> term <b><i>hafla’a</i>, I do not know what its</b> meaning <b>is. When it says: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down [<i>vehippilo</i>] and to be beaten before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>you must say</b> that the term <b><i>hafla’a</i> is</b> referring to <b>lashes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | lashes | Ketubot 32a:4 | The Talmud observes: <b>Apparently, Ulla maintains</b> that in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes, </b> e.g., one who has forced sex with his sister who is a young woman, one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where does Ulla</b> derive <b>this</b> principle? The Talmud answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of one who injures another. Just as</b> with regard to <b>one who injures another where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money</b> for the injury <b>and</b> receive <b>lashes</b> for violating the prohibition “Lest he continues to strike him” (Deuteronomy 25:3), the <i>halakha</i> there is that one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged, so too, </b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes, </b> one <b>pays money</b> but <b>is not flogged. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | “Forty he shall strike him” | Ketubot 32b:3 | The Talmud observes: <b>Apparently, R' Yoḥanan maintains</b> that in <b>any</b> case <b>where there is</b> liability to both pay <b>money and</b> receive <b>lashes, and</b> the witnesses <b>forewarned him, he is flogged</b> but does not <b>pay money. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where does R' Yoḥanan</b> derive <b>this</b> principle? The Talmud explains that he derives it from that which <b>the verse states</b> with regard to one sentenced to lashes in the court: “The judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before him, <b>according to the measure of his wickedness”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), from which it is inferred: <b>For one</b> act of <b>wickedness, </b> i.e., punishment, <b>you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two</b> acts of <b>wickedness. And juxtaposed to</b> this it states: <b>“Forty he shall strike him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating that the punishment that is administered when one is liable to receive two punishments is lashes and not payment. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | he shall not exceed, lest if he should exceed” | Ketubot 33a:1 | The Talmud asks: Based on that reasoning, the same would hold true for <b>one who injures another as well; if so, </b> if he pays and is not lashed, <b>you have rendered moot</b> the prohibition “Forty he shall strike him; <b>he shall not exceed, lest if he should exceed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3). The same would hold true for <b>conspiring witnesses as well; if so, you have rendered moot</b> the verse interpreted as addressing the matter of conspiring witnesses: <b>“And it shall be if the wicked man deserves to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). <b>Rather, </b> with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses, </b> that verse <b>can be fulfilled</b> in the case <b>of the son of a divorcée or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. </b> If witnesses testified that a priest is the son of a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i> and were discovered to be conspiring witnesses, there is no payment and they are flogged. With regard to <b>one who injures another as well, </b> the verse <b>can be fulfilled</b> in a case <b>where he struck him</b> with <b>a blow that</b> does <b>not</b> cause damage amounting to <b>the value of a <i>peruta</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | before your eyes [ le’einekha ]” | Makkot 13b:12 | <b>R' Abbahu says: The Torah explicitly included with regard to lashes those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, as is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy: “And they shall be excised [<i>venikhretu</i>] <b>before the eyes of [<i>le’einei</i>]</b> the children of their people” (Leviticus 20:17), <b>from: </b> “Forty he shall flog him…and your brother shall be dishonored <b>before your eyes [<i>le’einekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3). <b>R' Abba bar Memel objects to this: If so, </b> the inclusion of <b>those liable to</b> be executed with <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties <b>should also be learned</b> by means of a verbal analogy: “If <b>from the eyes of [<i>me’einei</i>]</b> the assembly it was performed unwittingly” (Numbers 15:24) stated with regard to idol worship, for which one is liable to be executed, <b>from: “Before your eyes, ”</b> stated with regard to lashes. On that basis, one should derive that those liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty should also be flogged. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | debased | Makkot 23a:1 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that the attendant rips the garments of the person about to be flogged. The Talmud explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to</b> the verse: “Forty he shall flog him…and your brother shall be <b>debased</b> before you” (Deuteronomy 25:3), as tearing his garments debases him. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | he shall not exceed, lest he continue | Makkot 23a:11 | <b>Rava said: It is reasonable</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda, as it is written: </b> “Forty he shall flog him; <b>he shall not exceed, lest he continue</b> to beat him” (Deuteronomy 25:3). He explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that even people <b>lacking in</b> halakhic <b>knowledge</b> are appointed, <b>that is</b> why <b>it is necessary to warn</b> him not to add lashes. <b>But if you say</b> only people who are <b>exceedingly knowledgeable</b> are appointed, <b>does</b> the Torah <b>need to warn</b> the attendant? Apparently, even a person lacking in knowledge can be appointed as an attendant. <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, </b> that is no proof, as there is an expression that <b>one implores only one who is</b> already <b>implored. </b> In other words, only one who is already cognizant of a <i>halakha</i> can be effectively warned to observe it. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | a great flogging” | Makkot 23a:14 | The Talmud cites another <i>baraita</i> with regard to the number of lashes. <b>A baraita states: </b> From the verse: “He shall not exceed, lest he continue to beat him beyond these, <b>a great flogging”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a prohibition with regard to <b>a great flogging; from where</b> do I derive that even <b>a minimal</b> excessive <b>flogging</b> is prohibited? I derive it from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “He shall not exceed, ”</b> at all. The Talmud asks: If so, <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state: “A great flogging”? </b> This <b>teaches that the initial</b> lashes must be administered <b>as a great flogging, </b> with all of the attendant’s strength. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | karet , as it is stated: “And your brother shall be debased before your eyes” | Makkot 23a:19 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>All those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> who were flogged are exempted from their</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “And your brother shall be debased before your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating: <b>Once he is flogged he is as your brother, </b> as his sin has been atoned and he is no longer excised from the Jewish people; this is <b>the statement of R' Ḥananya ben Gamliel. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | “Then your brother shall be dishonored before you” | Megillah 7b:19 | <b>We learned there</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Makkot</i> 23a): <b>All</b> those <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> who were flogged</b> in court <b>were exempted from their <i>karet</i>, </b> which is imposed by heaven. Most transgressors are liable to receive <i>karet</i> for violating prohibitions that are punishable by flogging. If they are flogged, they are exempt from <i>karet</i>, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to one liable to receive lashes: <b>“Then your brother shall be dishonored before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating that <b>once he was flogged he is like your brother, </b> and his sins have been pardoned; this is <b>the statement of R' Ḥananya ben Gamliel. R' Yoḥanan said: R' Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him</b> on this issue. |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | The verse states: “Then your brother will be dishonored before your eyes” | Sanhedrin 10a:13 | Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: <b>The verse states: “Then your brother will be dishonored before your eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3). This teaches that <b>when you strike, you strike upon the back of a live</b> person. After he is dead, he is not called: Your brother. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, continued to ask Rav Ashi: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 4:6): If they <b>assessed him</b> to be strong enough <b>to absorb twenty</b> lashes, <b>they flog him only</b> with a number of <b>lashes that can be divided into threes, </b> as lashes are administered in sets of three, two behind and one in front. <b>And how many are they? Eighteen. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:3 | a mitzva not to strike him | Sanhedrin 85a:7 | <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: And just as in a situation</b> where striking another is <b>a mitzva, where</b> the agent of the court <b>is commanded to strike him, </b> there is <b>a mitzva not to strike him</b> even one lash beyond the number determined by the court, as it is written: “Forty lashes shall he strike him, he shall not exceed, lest if he shall exceed to strike him” (Deuteronomy 25:3), accordingly, <b>in a situation</b> where striking another is <b>not a mitzva, where one is not commanded to strike him, is it not right that there is a mitzva not to strike him? </b> The general prohibition against striking another in any situation is derived from this verse. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | muzzling | Bava Kamma54b:10 | <b>With regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>muzzling</b> an animal, mentioned in the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat, </b> as the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of muzzling, and the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | as it is written: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing” | Bava Metzia88b:17 | <b>Ravina said: Verses are not necessary either</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a person</b> may eat <b>from detached</b> produce, <b>or</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an ox</b> must be allowed to eat <b>from attached</b> produce, <b>as it is written: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4). |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | exempt | Bava Metzia88b:2 | It was stated previously that a buyer is not required to tithe produce by Torah law. If so, the same certainly applies to a laborer. Consequently, the term <i>kenafshekha</i> cannot serve to teach that a laborer may eat without tithing, as claimed earlier. The Talmud asks: <b>Rather, what does <i>kenafshekha</i> come</b> to teach? The Talmud answers: It comes <b>to</b> teach <b>that which is taught in</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Kenafshekha</i></b> can mean: Like your own person. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>your own person, </b> i.e., the owner, <b>if you muzzled</b> yourself and did not eat from your field’s produce, you are <b>exempt</b> from liability for the transgression of: “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain” (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>a laborer, if you muzzled</b> him, i.e., you did not allow him to eat, you are <b>exempt</b> from liability for the transgression of muzzling an ox while it is working. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | from detached | Bava Metzia88b:8 | § The Talmud returns to its discussion with regard to the right of a laborer to eat while working: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a person</b> may eat <b>from attached</b> produce while working in the field; <b>and</b> likewise we found a source that <b>an ox</b> that is threshing must be allowed to eat <b>from detached</b> produce, as the verse states: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4). <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a person, </b> while working, may eat <b>from detached</b> produce? |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | the Merciful One states: “An ox in its threshing” | Bava Metzia90b:9 | § <b>R' Yonatan raised a dilemma before R' Simai: </b> If <b>one muzzled</b> the animal <b>from the outside, </b> i.e., before it began to thresh, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud clarifies the sides of the dilemma: One can argue that <b>God states: “An ox in its threshing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>and this</b> animal <b>is not in its threshing, </b> as it was muzzled before it was taken to thresh. <b>Or perhaps God states</b> that one <b>may not</b> have the animal <b>thresh while</b> it is <b>muzzled. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing” | Makkot 23a:2 | <b>Rav Sheshet says in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to the strap</b> used for flogging <b>that it is</b> a strap from the hide <b>of a calf? </b> It is <b>as it is written: “Forty he shall flog him, ” and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4), indicating that the strap is from the hide of an ox. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami said: As the verse states: “Do not muzzle the ox during its treading” | Meilah 13a:12 | § The Mishnah teaches that <b>the laborers</b> of Temple produce <b>may not eat from</b> consecrated dried figs, and likewise a cow may not eat from consecrated vetch. The Talmud does not ask about the source of the <i>halakha</i> of a laborer, as the verse clearly states in this regard: “When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard” (Deuteronomy 23:25), which does not include a vineyard belonging to the Temple; but the Talmud does ask about the case of the cow: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling with regard to a cow? <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami said: As the verse states: “Do not muzzle the ox during its treading”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4). The term <b>“its treading”</b> teaches that this prohibition applies to muzzling an ox when it is treading <b>your</b> non-sacred field, <b>and not</b> when it is <b>treading a consecrated</b> field. Since the consecrated produce is prohibited, one must muzzle the ox. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | like the prohibition against muzzling. | Menachot 58b:6 | <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye maintains that the offender <b>is not even flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling. </b> The principle that one is liable to be flogged for violating a prohibition is derived from the juxtaposition of the mitzva: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain” (Deuteronomy 25:4), with the verses that mention lashes. It is inferred from this juxtaposition that one is not liable to be flogged for violating prohibitions whose circumstances are not similar to that of muzzling, e.g., a general prohibition that is not referring to one specific action. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | like the prohibition against muzzling. | Pesachim 41b:4 | <b>Some say</b> that <b>one does not receive even one</b> set of <b>lashes</b> for violating this prohibition, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling. </b> The principle that one is liable to receive lashes for violating a prohibition is derived from the juxtaposition of the mitzva: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4) with the verses that deal with lashes. It is inferred from this juxtaposition that one is not liable to receive lashes for violating prohibitions that are dissimilar to that of muzzling, e.g., a prohibition that is not specific to one matter. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? | Sanhedrin 59b:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>But are birds capable of</b> performing <b>labor? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, </b> they are capable, <b>as Rabba bar Rav Huna raises a dilemma: </b> If one <b>threshed with geese and chickens, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei ben Yehuda? </b> R' Yosei ben Yehuda, derives from the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads” (Deuteronomy 25:4), that a laborer in a field is entitled to eat from the produce during his work only if his work involves both his hands and his feet, like an ox, which treads with its forelegs as well as its hind legs. Rabba bar Rav Huna raises a dilemma as to whether the prohibition against muzzling an animal while it is being used for labor in the field applies to geese and chickens, which have only two feet. In any event, it is indicated in that dilemma that birds can perform labor. |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | voice, | Sanhedrin 65b:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And is</b> projecting one’s <b>voice not</b> considered <b>an action according to R' Yoḥanan? But wasn’t it stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the following case: If one <b>muzzled</b> an animal <b>by</b> projecting his <b>voice, </b> by berating it whenever it tried to eat, has he transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4)? <b>And</b> similarly, if one <b>led</b> different species to work together <b>by</b> projecting his <b>voice, </b> without performing any action, has he transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10)? <b>R' Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, and Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:4 | As it is stated: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn” | Yevamot 4a:3 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>R' Elazar said in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a <i>yevama</i> who came before</b> a <i>yavam</i> <b>afflicted with boils that one may not muzzle her, </b> i.e., she cannot be forced to enter into levirate marriage, and he is compelled to release her by <i>ḥalitza</i>? <b>As it is stated: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>and, juxtaposed to it, </b> is the verse: <b>“If brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which begins the passage that deals with the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage. This teaches that just as it is prohibited to muzzle the ox, so too, one may not muzzle and ignore the complaints of a <i>yevama</i> who does not wish to marry a <i>yavam</i> afflicted with boils. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | portion about men whose married brothers had died childless, as it is stated: “If brothers dwell together, | Bava Batra119b:10 | The Talmud proves these assertions. That <b>they are wise</b> can be seen from the fact <b>that they spoke in accordance with the moment, </b> i.e., they presented their case at an auspicious time. <b>As R' Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: </b> Tradition <b>teaches that Moses our teacher was sitting and interpreting in</b> the Torah <b>portion about men whose married brothers had died childless, as it is stated: “If brothers dwell together, </b> and one of them dies, and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not be married abroad to one not of his kin; her husband’s brother shall come to her, and take her for him as a wife” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The daughters of Zelophehad <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>If we are</b> each <b>considered like a son, give us</b> each <b>an inheritance like a son; </b> and <b>if not, our mother should enter into levirate marriage. Immediately</b> upon hearing their claim, the verse records: <b>“And Moses brought their cause before YHWH”</b> (Numbers 27:5). |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | Levi, and I do not call her the wife of two dead men. | Gittin 82b:12 | If <b>Reuven came</b> to a woman <b>and betrothed her</b> saying that she is forbidden to all men <b>except for</b> his brother <b>Shimon, and Shimon</b> then <b>came and betrothed her</b> saying that she is forbidden to all men <b>except for Reuven, and they both died</b> without children, in this case <b>she performs levirate marriage with</b> their brother <b>Levi, and I do not call her the wife of two dead men. </b> It is stated in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> (31b) that if a woman has a levirate bond with a man due to her two late husbands who were his brothers, she may not perform levirate marriage with him, as it is derived from the verse: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family” (Deuteronomy 25:5), that the wife of only one dead man performs levirate marriage, not the wife of two. Abaye stated that in the case under discussion the woman may perform levirate marriage with Levi. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | and consummate the levirate marriage” | Ketubot 82a:13 | The Talmud explains: It is necessary to state this <b>lest you say</b> that since <b>God states</b> in the Torah: “And he will take her to him to be his wife <b>and consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>and</b> here the status of <b>the first levirate marriage is still upon her, </b> this would mean that <b>it should not suffice for her</b> to leave <b>by a bill of divorce, but</b> rather she can leave him only <b>by</b> performing <b><i>ḥalitza</i></b> as well. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <i>ḥalitza</i> is not required, as once he has married her she is like any other woman, who can be divorced by a bill of divorce alone. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | The verse states: “And he will take her to him to be his wife” | Ketubot 82b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> that <b>indeed, </b> the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife should be in force once again. The Talmud explains: <b>The verse states: “And he will take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that once <b>he has taken her, she has become like his</b> regular <b>wife</b> in all respects. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will engage in sexual intercourse with her and take her to him as a wife, | Kiddushin 14a:1 | <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her and take her to him as a wife, </b> and perform levirate marriage with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that sex renders her his wife. The Talmud asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to all matters</b> she is <b>like a wife, </b> and therefore she can also be acquired with money or a document like any other woman. The Talmud answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>money and a document can complete</b> the acquisition of a <i>yevama</i> and cause her to be married, <b>in the manner that sex completes</b> her acquisition. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And perform levirate marriage with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that only <b>sex completes her</b> acquisition, <b>but money or a document do not complete her</b> acquisition. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin; | Kiddushin 76a:1 | <b>and</b> they would <b>exempt married women</b> from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage. The Talmud elaborates: In <b>what</b> way would they <b>expound</b> the verse to lead them to this conclusion? The verse states: <b>“The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin; </b> her brother-in-law will have sex with her and take her to him to be his wife, and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). They understood the word “outside” to be a description of the woman: <b>She who sits outside, </b> i.e., one who is only betrothed; <b>she shall not be married to one not of his kin, </b> and it is with her that the obligation of levirate marriage applies. <b>But she who is not sitting outside, </b> but who has already married, <b>shall marry one not of his kin. </b> Consequently, the concern with regard to the Samaritans is that their descendants include the children of a widow who unlawfully wed one who was not her brother-in-law. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “When brothers dwell together” | Makkot 23a:3 | <b>And Rav Sheshet says in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a <i>yevama</i> who happened before</b> a <i>yavam</i> <b>afflicted with boils, that one does not compel her</b> to enter into that levirate marriage? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing, ” and juxtaposed to it</b> is written: <b>“When brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which is the passage dealing with levirate marriage. The <i>yevama</i> is not muzzled, as it were, when she states that she does not want to enter into levirate marriage with him. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | which is written: “If brothers dwell together | Niddah 44a:8 | The Mishnah also teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>creates</b> a levirate bond requiring the widow of his childless brother <b>to</b> enter into <b>levirate marriage</b> with him. The Talmud explains that this is derived from that <b>which is written: “If brothers dwell together</b> and one of them dies, and he has no child, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin. Her brother-in-law will have sex with her and take her to him to be his wife, and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). This verse is referring to <b>brothers who had one dwelling in the world, </b> i.e., who were alive at the same time, which includes a baby who was born the day his brother died. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | and he has no child” | Niddah 44a:9 | The Mishnah teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>exempts</b> his widowed mother <b>from the</b> obligation of <b>levirate marriage. </b> The Talmud explains the derivation: <b>God states: </b> “And one of them dies, <b>and he has no child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>and this</b> late husband <b>has</b> a child, albeit one who is one day old. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | levirate marriage while she was menstruating, he is exempt, | Pesachim 72b:12 | <b>And</b> they further reported that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> If <b>one</b> unwittingly <b>had sex with his wife while she was menstruating, he is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering. But if <b>he</b> unwittingly <b>had sex with his sister-in-law who was waiting</b> to become his wife through <b>levirate marriage while she was menstruating, he is exempt, </b> because the act of sex itself is a mitzva. A man whose brother died without children is obliged by Torah law to marry his deceased brother’s widow and “come to her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), so that even if he mistakenly transgressed while attempting to fulfill the mitzva, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her | Yevamot 111b:16 | The Talmud asks: How can the minor enter into levirate marriage? The verse <b>here reads: </b> “And if the man does not wish to take his <i>yevama</i>, his <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the Elders and say: My brother-in-law refused <b>to establish a name for his brother</b> in Israel; he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and this</b> minor <b>is incapable of doing so, </b> as he cannot sire children. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her</b> and take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5), to include <b>anyone, </b> even someone who cannot sire children. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | Rav said: Any yevama to whom I cannot apply the verse “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 111b:17 | <b>Rava said: </b> Even <b>without this</b> interpretation <b>you still could not say</b> that it is prohibited for a minor to enter into levirate marriage. Is <b>there a case</b> of levirate marriage <b>where she is forbidden to him now, and after some time she becomes permitted? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: Any <i>yevama</i> to whom I cannot apply the verse “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) <b>at the time she happens before him</b> for levirate marriage, <b>is considered as if she were the wife of a brother who has children, </b> who is exempt from levirate marriage, <b>and she is</b> consequently <b>forbidden</b> to him forever? It must be the case that minors can perform levirate marriage. If it was forbidden, then they would be exempt from levirate marriage even after reaching the age of majority. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | The verse states: “If brothers dwell together” | Yevamot 111b:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>And say, indeed, </b> a minor should be exempt from levirate marriage, and consequently forbidden from ever marrying his brother’s wife. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “If brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), indicating that this rule applies to all brothers who are alive simultaneously, <b>even</b> if the brother was only <b>one day old. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 12a:16 | <b>And</b> this brother who performed the levirate betrothal <b>died</b> before consummation of the marriage. In this case, both of <b>these, </b> the wife of the first brother, who had already come before the second brother for levirate marriage, and the wife of the second brother, <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage. As it is stated: “And one of them dies</b> and he has no child, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin; <b>her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This implies that the option of levirate marriage applies only to <b>one who is subject to</b> the levirate <b>bond of one <i>yavam</i>, </b> for only one deceased brother, <b>and not</b> the <b>bond of two <i>yevamin</i>. </b> Since it is considered as though the first widow has two levirate duties to fulfill, neither she nor her rival wife may enter into levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | of Beit Shammai? As it is written: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin” | Yevamot 13b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>R' Shimon ben Pazi said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai? As it is written: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). The term <b>“outside”</b> indicates <b>by inference that there is</b> a woman who is considered <b>inside, </b> i.e., a close relative of the <i>yavam</i>, who is inside his family. <b>And God states: “Shall not be</b> married” and also “to one not of his kin. ” In other words, even when one of the wives is a forbidden relative, the rival wife who is outside the family of the <i>yavam</i> is obligated in levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | as it is stated: The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin” | Yevamot 13b:4 | <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> respond to this argument of Beit Shammai? <b>They require these</b> passages <b>for that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that betrothal is not effective</b> in the case <b>of a <i>yevama</i></b> who did not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, if the betrothal is performed by an unrelated man and not a <i>yavam</i>? This betrothal is not valid at all, <b>as it is stated: The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This verse indicates that <b>there shall not be in her</b> case <b>the becoming</b> married <b>to</b> one <b>not of his kin. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “To one not of his kin” | Yevamot 13b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And Beit Shammai, from where do they</b> derive that <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said? </b> The Talmud answers: They <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“To one not of his kin”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This phrase indicates that marriage is invalid with an unrelated man. However, they learn another matter from the term “outside. ” |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | prohibition: | Yevamot 14a:16 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>Granted, Beit Shammai did not refrain</b> from marrying into <b>Beit Hillel, </b> as even if Beit Shammai maintain in a certain case that a rival wife required levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, if she went ahead and married another man their <b>children are</b> born to a union whose partners are <b>liable by</b> a regular <b>prohibition: </b> “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside” (Deuteronomy 25:5). Since this transgression does not entail <i>karet</i>, the children of this relationship are not <i>mamzerim</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | Rav said: The verse states “If brothers dwell together | Yevamot 17b:2 | § The Talmud turns from a review of the language used in the Mishnah to a discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of a wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist. <b>Where is it written</b> that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply in the case of <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The verse states “If brothers dwell together</b> and one of them dies” (Deuteronomy 25:5), meaning <b>that they had a common dwelling</b> together <b>in the world. </b> This <b>excludes the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. </b> Furthermore, it is derived: <b>“Together”</b> means that they were <b>united</b> together <b>in an inheritance; </b> i.e., they are united in that they inherit together. In other words, since property is inherited by sons from their father, it can be inferred that the verse is speaking specifically of brothers from the same father. This <b>excludes his maternal</b> half <b>brother, </b> with whom he is not united by inheritance, since only brothers who share the same father inherit from each other. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | As it is stated: “And one of them dies…her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her | Yevamot 18b:14 | What is the reason that the wife of the first brother is not eligible for levirate marriage? <b>As it is stated: “And one of them dies…her brother-in-law will have sex with her</b> and will take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). From here it is derived: <b>She who is subject to</b> a levirate <b>bond with a single <i>yavam</i></b> enters levirate marriage <b>and not she who is subject to</b> a levirate <b>bond with two <i>yevamin</i>. </b> This woman requires levirate marriage due to the death of the first brother, and also, due to the subsequent levirate betrothal, requires levirate marriage following the death of the second brother. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage [ veyibbema ]” | Yevamot 19b:13 | <b>Rather, </b> the question was as follows: R' Shimon gave such a persuasive explanation of his opinion that it raises the question: <b>What is the reason for the Rabbis’</b> opinion? The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: </b> “Her brother-in-law will…<b>take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage [<i>veyibbema</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This means that <b>the first levirate bond is still upon her. </b> Even after she is taken as a wife by the second brother, her earlier status as wife of her late first husband is still in effect. The Talmud challenges this: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which we learn</b> in a Mishnah (38a): If <b>he took</b> his <i>yevama</i> <b>in marriage</b> as his wife, <b>then her</b> legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense; and R' Yosei bar Ḥanina said: </b> This <b>teaches</b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | It is different there, as the verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife” | Yevamot 20a:2 | The Talmud answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) to teach that <b>once he has taken her, </b> her legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense. </b> The Talmud objects: <b>If so, here too, </b> in the case of a brother born after the levirate marriage, according to the opinion of the Rabbis this same principle should apply. The Talmud answers that <b>God states: “And consummate the levirate marriage [<i>veyibbema</i>], ”</b> that is, even after the marriage she is still considered to be the wife of the deceased brother [<i>yevama</i>] with respect to any brothers who are born later. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “And he has no [ ain lo ] child” | Yevamot 22b:6 | The Mishnah states: With regard to <b>anyone who has a son of any kind, </b> that son <b>exempts</b> his father’s wife from any levirate bond. The Talmud asks: <b>What is added</b> by the phrase: <b>Of any kind? Rav Yehuda said: It adds</b> a child who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i>. What is the reason</b> that a <i>mamzer</i> exempts a woman from any levirate bond? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to levirate marriage: <b>“And he has no [<i>ain lo</i>] child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). The phrase <i>ain lo</i> can be understood as <i>ayyen alav</i>, meaning <b>investigate him. </b> That is to say, investigate whether he is indeed childless, because any child, even a <i>mamzer</i>, exempts the widow from a levirate bond. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | The verse states: “And one of them dies” | Yevamot 24a:14 | The Talmud again challenges the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Then say</b> that <b>when there is a firstborn the mitzva of levirate marriage can be fulfilled</b> by any of the brothers, <b>but that when there is no firstborn, </b> e.g., if he had already died, <b>the mitzva of levirate marriage may not be fulfilled</b> by any of the younger brothers. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And one of them dies”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), without specifying which brother dies. <b>Are we not dealing</b> even <b>with</b> the case <b>where the firstborn died, and</b> yet <b>God states</b> that <b>the younger</b> brother <b>should consummate the levirate marriage? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | The verse states: “If brothers dwell together” | Yevamot 24a:16 | The Talmud challenges the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Say</b> that <b>when there is no firstborn</b> brother, if <b>a younger</b> brother <b>went ahead</b> and consummated the levirate marriage, then <b>he acquires</b> his <i>yevama</i> as a wife. <b>But if there is a firstborn, </b> and <b>the younger</b> brother <b>went ahead</b> and performed levirate marriage first, then <b>he does not acquire</b> his <i>yevama</i> as a wife, because the Torah specifies that the firstborn brother must perform the mitzva. The Talmud rejects this: <b>The verse states: “If brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), implying that <b>the brothers’ dwellings were equated one with the other, </b> and all the brothers are equally obligated in this mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | that any yevama to whom the verse “her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 27b:6 | <b>However, R' Yoḥanan said: </b> If <b>the second</b> sister <b>dies, he is permitted to</b> take <b>the first. But if the first</b> sister <b>dies, he is prohibited from</b> taking <b>the second</b> sister. <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? The reason is <b>that any <i>yevama</i> to whom the verse “her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) <b>cannot be applied at the time that she happens</b> before him for levirate marriage because she was forbidden to him at that moment, <b>is then</b> forever considered to be <b>like the wife of a brother who has children, and she is forbidden</b> to him. Because the second sister was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> at the time that she happened before him for levirate marriage, being the sister of a woman with whom he had a levirate bond, she can never again be permitted to him. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | it is written: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 29b:10 | Abaye <b>said to him</b> that this question is not necessary, as well: <b>Now, </b> if <b>he did not perform levirate betrothal with her</b> at all, <b>it is written: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). It is deduced from this verse that he can take her even <b>against her will. Is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> if <b>he performed levirate betrothal with her, </b> even without a wedding canopy, that he is allowed to have sex with her? |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | Any yevama to whom the verse “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 30a:8 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> a principle on this matter: <b>Any <i>yevama</i> to whom the verse “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) <b>cannot be applied at the time that she happens</b> before him for levirate marriage because she was forbidden to him at that moment, <b>is then</b> forever considered to be <b>like the wife of a brother</b> with whom <b>she has children, and she is forbidden</b> to him. The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> Rav <b>teaching us</b> with this statement? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the Mishnah: <b>She is forbidden to him forever, since she was forbidden to him at one time. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 31b:13 | <b>As it is stated: </b> “If brothers dwell together <b>and one of them dies</b> and he has no child, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin; <b>her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This teaches that a woman eligible for levirate marriage is one <b>who has one levirate relationship and not one who has a double levirate relationship. </b> In this case, the wife of the first deceased brother requires levirate marriage due to both the marriage with her first husband as well as the levirate betrothal with the second brother. <b>R' Shimon says: He</b> may <b>consummate the levirate marriage with whichever</b> woman <b>he wishes and</b> then <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | and he has no child” | Yevamot 35b:11 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> that they disagree over the interpretation of <b>a verse</b> in that <b>R' Yoḥanan holds: God states</b> in the Torah: “If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies, <b>and he has no child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), i.e., the obligation to consummate a levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i> applies whenever a husband dies and is not survived by offspring. <b>And this</b> man, whose wife is currently pregnant, <b>does not have</b> any children who will survive him. Therefore, there is an obligation to consummate a levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and if done, they will be effective. <b>And Reish Lakish holds: </b> The phrase <b>“and he has no [<i>ein</i>] child”</b> is expounded by the rabbis to teach that one should <b>inspect [<i>ayein</i>] him</b> carefully to determine if he is survived by offspring of any form, and currently he is in fact survived by the fetus. Therefore, there is currently no obligation to consummate a levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and consequently, even if done, they are ineffective. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | since it is written: “And take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage with her” | Yevamot 39a:13 | The Talmud examines the first clause of R' Yosei bar Ḥanina’s statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that to sever his relationship with her, <b>he divorces her with a bill of divorce? </b> The Talmud explains: It is necessary to teach this because <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), continuing to refer to the marriage as a levirate marriage even after the verse has stated that he took her as a wife, one might claim <b>God is saying</b> that the <b>original levirate</b> bond <b>continues to be upon her, </b> and therefore, <b>with <i>ḥalitza</i>, yes, </b> they can sever the relationship, but <b>with a bill of divorce, no, </b> the relationship would not be severed. Therefore, the Mishnah <b>teaches us</b> that she is considered to be his wife to the extent that the relationship can be severed with a bill of divorce alone. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | The verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife” | Yevamot 39a:15 | The Talmud challenges this ruling: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this <b>is indeed so, </b> that she should be forbidden to him? The Talmud explains: <b>The verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), indicating that <b>once he has taken her, </b> her legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 39b:17 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says</b> that <b>one who consummates</b> a levirate marriage <b>with his <i>yevama</i> for the sake of</b> her <b>beauty, or for the sake of marital sex, or for the sake of another matter, </b> e.g., he wishes to inherit her husband’s estate, <b>it is</b> considered <b>as though he encountered a forbidden relation, and I am inclined to view the offspring</b> born from such a union <b>as a <i>mamzer</i>. </b> Since the prohibition against engaging in sex with one’s brother’s wife is overridden only for the sake of fulfilling the mitzva of consummating the levirate marriage, when one does not have the intention to fulfill that mitzva, the baseline prohibition applies, and so any offspring from the union will be <i>mamzerim</i>. <b>The Rabbis say: </b> The Torah states: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that he should do so <b>in any case, </b> even if his intentions are not solely for the sake of fulfilling the mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 39b:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>that A baraita states: </b> The Torah states: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5); this is to be considered <b>a mitzva, as initially, </b> before she was married to his brother, <b>she was among</b> all other women who are <b>permitted to him, </b> and then when she married his brother <b>she became forbidden</b> to him, <b>and</b> when his brother died without offspring <b>she reverted</b> from her forbidden status <b>and became permitted to him. </b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she would revert to her original permitted status; </b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> to teach that it is in fact <b>a mitzva</b> to do so. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 3b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the wife of a deceased brother: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that when <b>the verse speaks of</b> the mitzva of levirate marriage, it includes <b>even any one of those with whom sex are forbidden, </b> as <b>mentioned in the Torah. </b> Therefore, one derives a verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here, </b> with regard to a wife’s sister: <b>“With her, ” and it is stated there, </b> with regard to a levirate marriage: <b>“With her. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “If brothers dwell together” | Yevamot 4a:3 | <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>R' Elazar said in the name of R' Elazar ben Azarya: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a <i>yevama</i> who came before</b> a <i>yavam</i> <b>afflicted with boils that one may not muzzle her, </b> i.e., she cannot be forced to enter into levirate marriage, and he is compelled to release her by <i>ḥalitza</i>? <b>As it is stated: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>and, juxtaposed to it, </b> is the verse: <b>“If brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which begins the passage that deals with the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage. This teaches that just as it is prohibited to muzzle the ox, so too, one may not muzzle and ignore the complaints of a <i>yevama</i> who does not wish to marry a <i>yavam</i> afflicted with boils. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 54a:3 | § The Talmud inquires as to the source of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As A baraita states</b> with regard to the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), that this indicates that the act of sex in this circumstance is <b>a mitzva, </b> i.e., it is preferable to the alternative, which is <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>Alternatively, </b> the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her, ”</b> indicates that it does not matter how he had sex with her, <b>whether unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | has not acquired his yevama , as the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 54a:7 | § The Talmud addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the previous discussion. <b>Rav Yehuda said: A sleeping</b> man <b>has not acquired his <i>yevama</i>, as the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that he does not acquire her <b>unless he intends</b> to act <b>for the sake of sex. </b> Since a sleeping man does not intend to have sex, he does not acquire his <i>yevama</i>. The Talmud asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one acquires his <i>yevama</i> through sex regardless of <b>whether he</b> was <b>awake or asleep? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>Say</b> the <i>baraita</i> in the following emended form: <b>Whether she</b> was <b>awake or asleep. </b> The woman’s awareness is not a necessary component in order to perform levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” | Yevamot 54b:4 | The Talmud further asks: <b>But</b> if that is the source of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>why do I need</b> the term <b><i>nidda</i> that is written with regard to a brother’s wife? </b> The Talmud answers that it is needed <b>for that which Rav Huna</b> taught, <b>as Rav Huna said: From where in the Torah</b> is there <b>a hint to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>? </b> The Talmud expresses surprise: <b>From where? Isn’t it written</b> explicitly in the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have sex with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5)? <b>Rather, </b> Rav Huna meant to say: <b>From where</b> is there <b>a hint that a <i>yevama</i> is forbidden</b> to her brother-in-law <b>in her husband’s lifetime, </b> even after she is divorced from her husband? |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | entering. | Yevamot 55b:3 | <b>Rather, </b> the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a <b><i>yevama</i></b> is acquired by her <b><i>yavam</i></b> via the initial stage of sex? The Talmud answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the <b>words entering</b> and <b>entering. </b> This verb is used with regard to ordinary Torah prohibitions, as mentioned above, and also with regard to levirate marriage, in the verse “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5). |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | “And he has no child” | Yevamot 87b:6 | The Talmud further suggests: <b>And let us make</b> her <b>child from the first</b> husband <b>like</b> her <b>child from the second</b> one <b>with regard to levirate marriage, </b> again <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make the living like the dead with regard to <i>teruma</i>, </b> it still <b>made a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second, </b> then in <b>a place where it made the living like the dead, with regard to levirate marriage, is it not right that we should make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second, </b> and thereby exempt her from levirate marriage? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states</b> about levirate marriage: <b>“And he has no child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>and</b> in fact <b>he had none</b> at the time of his death. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | says | Yevamot 8a:13 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different <i>baraita</i> that contradicts Rava’s statement: <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that there is a different proof that a forbidden relation and her rival wife are prohibited in levirate marriage. The Torah says: “He will have sex with her and take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5). Since the verse does not say simply: <b>have sex, </b> but: <b>“have sex with her, ”</b> this indicates that he takes this woman specifically, not a different woman who is forbidden. Furthermore, the verse does not simply state: <b>And consummate the levirate marriage, </b> but: <b>“And consummate the levirate marriage with her. ”</b> These additions serve <b>to prohibit rival wives and</b> women <b>with whom sex are forbidden. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | to be his wife” | Yevamot 8b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive these widely accepted <i>halakhot</i>? The Talmud responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> cited by <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina, </b> that a woman taken in levirate marriage has the status of a regular wife who may be divorced and remarried, <b>is derived from</b> the verse “and take her to him <b>to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which means that she will be his wife for all purposes, like any other wife. And the <i>halakha</i> that levirate marriage can be effected <b>against her will is derived from “her brother-in-law will have sex with her, ”</b> which indicates that it can be achieved without her consent. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | regular prohibitions, | Yevamot 92a:18 | The Talmud answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> called the Rabbis <b>is</b> in fact another <b><i>tanna</i></b> citing the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, </b> who claims <b>that</b> R' Akiva <b>said</b> that a child born <b>from</b> those <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions</b> proscribing sexual sex with <b>close</b> relatives <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>, </b> but one born <b>from</b> those <b>liable for</b> violating <b>regular prohibitions, </b> i.e., a prohibition that does not involve a family relationship, such as the prohibition that “the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin” (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>is not a <i>mamzer</i>. Rav Yehuda said</b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | does not take effect with a yevama ? As it is stated: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin” | Yevamot 92b:1 | that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that betrothal</b> by another man <b>does not take effect with a <i>yevama</i>? As it is stated: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates: <b>She shall not have</b> the possibility of <b>becoming</b> married <b>to one not of his kin, </b> i.e., his betrothal is of no account. |
| Deuteronomy 25:5 | outside | Yoma 13b:5 | <b>Ravina, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Sherevya, strongly objects to this: </b> It was stated above that a woman betrothed to the High Priest is not considered his house, i.e., his wife. <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, a betrothed</b> woman whose betrothed passed away should <b>not be</b> obligated <b>to</b> marry his brother in <b>levirate marriage, </b> since the term: House, appears in that context as well. In practice, that is not the <i>halakha</i>. The Talmud answers that the Torah says: “The wife of the dead shall not be married <b>outside</b> to one not of his kin” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The superfluous term: Outside, comes <b>to include the betrothed woman. </b> Although she is technically still outside the family, the brother of the deceased must either marry her in levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | Rava said: The verse states: “And it shall be, the firstborn” | Bava Batra12b:10 | <b>Abaye said: This</b> case <b>is</b> equal to <b>that</b> case. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>God calls</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>“firstborn”</b> (see <i>Yevamot</i> 24a) and therefore he is treated like a firstborn in all regards. He receives the two portions of his father’s estate as a single parcel of land. But <b>Rava said: The verse states: “And it shall be, the firstborn”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6). With regard to <b>his being, </b> i.e., his inheritance itself, he <b>is like a firstborn; but</b> as for <b>the distribution</b> of the estate, he <b>is not like a firstborn, </b> and the brothers are not obligated to give him two adjacent portions. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | a firstborn, | Bekhorot 52a:6 | The Mishnah teaches: <b>Nor</b> does <b>the <i>yavam</i></b> receive these portions. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Talmud answers that <b>God calls</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>a firstborn, </b> in the verse: “And it shall be, the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 25:6). <b>Abaye says: </b> The rabbis <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to an enhancement by</b> which <b>the property</b> was <b>enhanced between the death</b> of the brother <b>and the levirate marriage. But</b> concerning the enhancement <b>that</b> occurs <b>between the levirate marriage and the distribution</b> of the inheritance, <b>he does take</b> it. <b>What is the reason? God states: “Shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and</b> by that stage <b>he has succeeded</b> him, and the enhancement occurred at that stage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | a firstborn, | Bekhorot 52b:6 | <b>And one who inherits his wife’s</b> property need not return it to her family in the Jubilee Year, as R' Meir maintains that <b>the inheritance of a husband</b> is <b>by Torah law, </b> not a rabbinic enactment, and land acquired through inheritance is not returned. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>one who consummates the levirate marriage with the wife of his brother</b> need not return the brother’s property for redistribution among the brothers. This is because <b>God calls</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>a firstborn, </b> in the verse: “And it shall be, the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 25:6), and R' Meir holds that the portion of the firstborn is not returned in the Jubilee Year, as explained earlier. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | brother” | Yevamot 117a:4 | Rav Ḥisda explains: <b>God states</b> in the Torah: <b>“He shall succeed in the name of his</b> dead <b>brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), which is interpreted by the rabbis as referring to the right of inheritance of the brother who consummates the levirate marriage. <b>And</b> this man <b>did succeed</b> with respect to the marital relationship, as he consummated the levirate marriage based on the testimony of his <i>yevama</i> that her husband died. Consequently, he takes the place of his brother with respect to his inheritance as well. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | “The firstborn that she bears” | Yevamot 12a:14 | § The Talmud continues to discuss various cases of forbidden women. <b>Rav Asi said: The rival wife of a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>] is forbidden. </b> In other words, if one of the wives of the deceased brother was an <i>aylonit</i>, who is incapable of giving birth, the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a woman who requires levirate marriage: <b>“The firstborn that she bears”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), which comes <b>to exclude an <i>aylonit</i>, who cannot give birth. </b> Since the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage do not apply to an <i>aylonit</i>, she retains her status as a brother’s wife who is forbidden, and therefore her rival wife is also exempt from levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | brother” | Yevamot 24a:19 | The Talmud challenges the <i>halakha</i> again: <b>Then say</b> that <b>if the firstborn consummates the levirate marriage he receives</b> his deceased brother’s <b>inheritance, </b> but <b>if an ordinary brother consummates the levirate marriage he does not receive the inheritance. </b> The Talmud answers that <b>the verse states: </b> “The firstborn that she bears <b>shall be established in the name of his</b> dead <b>brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and</b> if the younger brother performs levirate marriage he has <b>established</b> his brother’s name and thereby earns the inheritance. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | “And it shall be that the firstborn | Yevamot 24a:5 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> the following interpretation of the verse: <b>“And it shall be that the firstborn</b> that she bears shall be established in the name of his dead brother and his name will not be blotted out of Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:6). <b>From here</b> the rabbis derive <b>that the mitzva to consummate the levirate marriage is upon the eldest. </b> The next phrase: <b>“That she bears, ”</b> is interpreted <b>to exclude</b> levirate marriage in the case of a widow who is <b>an <i>aylonit</i>, who cannot bear children. </b> From the next phrase: <b>“Shall be established in the name of his dead brother, ”</b> it is derived that the same brother who performs the mitzva of levirate marriage is established in his brother’s name with regard <b>to inheritance, </b> i.e., he inherits his brother’s property. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | “And his name will not be blotted out | Yevamot 24a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the next phrase of the verse: <b>“And his name will not be blotted out</b> of Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:6). This <b>excludes</b> the case where the deceased was <b>a eunuch, as his name is</b> already <b>blotted out, </b> since it is impossible for him to have children. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | brother” | Yevamot 40a:17 | The Mishnah states: <b>One who consummates</b> levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> thereby acquires his deceased brother’s property. The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>God states</b> in the Torah: <b>“He shall succeed in the name of his</b> dead <b>brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and he has succeeded</b> him by marrying his wife; consequently, he succeeds him by acquiring his property as well. |
| Deuteronomy 25:6 | of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And it shall be that the firstborn that she bears | Yevamot 40a:19 | <b>And Ulla said, and some say</b> that it was <b>R' Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> who said: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda? As it is written: “And it shall be that the firstborn that she bears</b> shall succeed in the name of his dead brother” (Deuteronomy 25:6). The term “firstborn” is understood to be a reference to the <i>yavam</i>. By referring to him in this way the Torah indicates that his rights to his brother’s estate are <b>like</b> those of <b>a firstborn</b> child’s rights to his father’s estate: <b>Just as a firstborn has no</b> rights to any of his father’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father, </b> and he may take his double portion only upon the father’s death, <b>so too, this</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>as well has no</b> rights to any of his brother’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | passage | Bava Batra156a:5 | The Talmud explains why it is necessary to mention examining a boy <b>for</b> the purpose of <b><i>ḥalitza</i>: </b> This is mentioned <b>to the exclusion of that which R' Yosei</b> says, <b>as</b> R' Yosei <b>says: “Man, ”</b> i.e., an adult man, <b>is written in the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse states: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>But a woman, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or a minor, </b> can be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse does not indicate her age. To counter this, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us that a woman is juxtaposed to a man</b> in this passage, indicating that the <i>yevama</i> must also have reached adulthood, and the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | The mitzva of levirate marriage takes precedence over the mitzva of ḥalitza , | Bekhorot 13a:6 | <b>The mitzva of levirate marriage takes precedence over the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> which dissolves the levirate bond, as it is stated: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). The Mishnah adds: This was the case <b>initially, when</b> people <b>would intend</b> that their performance of levirate marriage be <b>for the sake of the mitzva. But now that they do not intend</b> that their performance of levirate marriage be <b>for the sake of the mitzva, </b> but rather for reasons such as the beauty of the <i>yevama</i> or for financial gain, the rabbis <b>said</b> that <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i> takes precedence over the mitzva of levirate marriage. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “My yavam refuses [ me’en ]” | Kiddushin 4a:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> himself, from where does he</b> know <b>that</b> one <b>can expound</b> the <i>yod</i> in <i>ein</i> in <b>this</b> manner? The Talmud answers: <b>They say</b> in explanation that it is <b>written: “Balaam refuses [<i>me’en</i>]”</b> (Numbers 22:14), <b>and</b> it is similarly written: <b>“My <i>yavam</i> refuses [<i>me’en</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), and <b>in neither</b> case <b>is a <i>yod</i> written. And here</b> the word <i>ein</i> <b>is written with a <i>yod</i>. Learn from it that</b> the <i>yod</i> is superfluous and <b>comes</b> for the sake of <b>an exposition. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “man” is written in the passage | Niddah 32a:2 | The Rabbis <b>said to R' Meir: You have aptly stated that they may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> since <b>“man” is written in the passage</b> of the Torah discussing <i>ḥalitza</i> (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and we compare a woman to a man, </b> as the aforementioned verse states: “And if the man does not want to take his brother’s wife. ” Consequently, neither a minor boy nor a minor girl may perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>they may not enter into levirate marriage? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | is written in the passage | Niddah 52a:7 | The Talmud explains: This emphasis serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yosei, who said: Man, </b> i.e., an adult man, <b>is written in the passage</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>woman, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or whether</b> she is <b>a minor, </b> she can be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the Torah does not specify her age. The Mishnah <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of R' Yosei. Rather, <b>if</b> she <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs, </b> then <b>yes, </b> she can perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, whereas <b>if</b> she did <b>not</b> grow two hairs, she may <b>not</b> perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or enter into levirate marriage. <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? It is that the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>woman</b> is <b>like</b> that of the <b>man, </b> as a woman is juxtaposed to man in this passage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | she says: “My brother-in-law refused | Sanhedrin 49b:10 | <b>And</b> if they decide to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>she says: “My brother-in-law refused</b> to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he says: “I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And they would say</b> these statements <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> Hebrew. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | the mitzva of ḥalitza : She recites | Sanhedrin 49b:12 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that this is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | Elders” | Yevamot 101a:12 | The Talmud discusses the dispute as to how many individuals must conduct the <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>, </b> who requires three? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>ḥalitza</i>: “His <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the <b>Elders”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7). Since the minimum number of the plural term “Elders” is <b>two, and</b> since, in order to prevent a paralyzing disagreement between an even number of judges, <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are three</b> judges. <b>And R' Yehuda</b> interprets the verse otherwise, for one verse states: “And the <b>Elders of</b> his city shall call him” (Deuteronomy 25:8), indicating a minimum of <b>two</b> judges, and it says in the following verse <b>“Elders”</b> another time, indicating an additional <b>two</b> people, <b>and</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are five</b> judges. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | as it is written: “His yevama shall ascend to the gate to the Elders” | Yevamot 101b:14 | § The Talmud begins a discussion concerning the halakhic details of <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>Rava said: The judges need to establish a location</b> ahead of time where the <i>ḥalitza</i> will be performed, <b>as it is written: “His <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the Elders”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), indicating that there is an established place, “the gate,” for the court to convene for <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Talmud relates: <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, conducted a case</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>before five</b> judges. The Talmud asks: <b>In accordance with</b> whose opinion were they ruling? If you say they ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yehuda, but</b> it was proven above that <b>R' Yehuda retracted</b> his initial opinion and requires only three judges. The Talmud answers: They did this only <b>to publicize the matter</b> and not because this number of judges is required. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | portion | Yevamot 105b:2 | § It was taught in the Mishnah: <b>If a female minor performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> a second time once she becomes an adult, and if she does not, her first <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is the statement of R' Meir, who said: “Man” is written in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> about <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And if the man does not wish” (Deuteronomy 25:7), implying an adult must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and we juxtapose</b> and compare <b>a woman with a man, </b> indicating that the woman must also be an adult at the time of <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | she says: “My brother-in-law refused to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” | Yevamot 106b:2 | If they decide to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>she says: “My brother-in-law refused to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he says: “I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And they would say</b> these statements <b>in the sacred</b> Hebrew <b>language</b> and not in any other language. Afterward, the shoe is removed and she spits before him, as is written: <b>“His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), which indicates that <b>this spittle</b> must be <b>visible to the judges. “And</b> she shall <b>respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>Up until this point</b> the judges <b>would prompt</b> the parties <b>to recite</b> the text that they are required to say. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | the mitzva of ḥalitza : She recites | Yevamot 106b:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said: </b> This is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), and afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us? This is</b> already explicit in <b>the Mishnah. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that <b>the mitzva is like this, </b> i.e., this is the proper order, <b>but if one switched the order, we have no</b> problem <b>with it, </b> as even though he did not fulfill the mitzva properly, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is still valid, since the order is not indispensable. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “He did not” | Yevamot 106b:6 | § <b>Abaye said</b> concerning the details of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>The one who prompts</b> the <i>yavam</i> and the <i>yevama</i> <b>to read</b> the text for the <b>bill of <i>ḥalitza</i> should not prompt her</b> by reciting <b>“He did not”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7) <b>by itself, and “wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7) <b>by itself, because</b> such a way of reading <b>sounds</b> to one who hears only the second phrase <b>like</b> he is saying: <b>My <i>yavam</i> does wish to consummate the marriage. Rather, </b> he should prompt her all at once consecutively: <b>“He did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), which will ensure that the intended meaning is clear. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | said: One who writes a bill of ḥalitza must write as follows: We prompted her to recite from “My brother-in-law refused” until “he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” | Yevamot 106b:9 | <b>He said to him: </b> Although Rava disagreed with Abaye about interruptions in the recitation of: “I do not wish to take her,” <b>Rava concedes concerning</b> the recitation of: <b>“He did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage, ”</b> as this recitation is essential and must be recited properly. Rav Kahana added that <b>Abaye</b> also <b>said: One who writes a bill of <i>ḥalitza</i> must write as follows: We prompted her to recite from “My brother-in-law refused” until “he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7); <b>and we prompted him to recite from</b> “I do <b>not” until “take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And we prompted her to recite from “So shall”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>until “he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | to establish a name for his brother | Yevamot 111b:16 | The Talmud asks: How can the minor enter into levirate marriage? The verse <b>here reads: </b> “And if the man does not wish to take his <i>yevama</i>, his <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the Elders and say: My brother-in-law refused <b>to establish a name for his brother</b> in Israel; he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and this</b> minor <b>is incapable of doing so, </b> as he cannot sire children. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her</b> and take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5), to include <b>anyone, </b> even someone who cannot sire children. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “man” | Yevamot 119a:7 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But</b> the case of <b>a minor boy or minor girl, </b> as pertains to levirate marriage, <b>is</b> dependent upon <b>a non-evident majority, and</b> nevertheless <b>the Rabbis follow the majority</b> in their ruling, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor boy or minor girl may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Meir. </b> The Rabbis <b>said to R' Meir: You have aptly stated that they may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> since <b>“man”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), i.e., an adult male, <b>is written in the section</b> of the Torah pertaining to <i>ḥalitza</i>. Though an adult female is not mentioned explicitly, <b>we employ</b> an analogy based on <b>juxtaposition</b> of <b>the woman to the man</b> and require that the female involved in <i>ḥalitza</i> be an adult as well. <b>But what is the reason that they may not enter into levirate marriage, </b> about which the Torah’s phraseology does not specifically indicate adults? |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | The verse states: “His yevama shall ascend to the gate | Yevamot 20a:18 | <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> in response: <b>The verse states: “His <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate</b> to the Elders and say: My brother-in-law refused to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “His <i>yevama</i>, ”</b> since it is clear to whom the verse refers and no new information is added by this word, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “His <i>yevama</i>”? </b> It comes to teach that <b>there is one <i>yevama</i> who ascends for <i>ḥalitza</i> but may not ascend for levirate marriage, </b> and her brother-in-law is not given a choice. <b>Who is this? This is</b> a woman with whom it is prohibited for her <i>yavam</i> to enter into levirate marriage, as he would be <b>liable</b> for the violation of <b>a prohibition, </b> and the positive mitzva of levirate marriage does not override the prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | The verse states: “And if the man does not wish to take | Yevamot 20a:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>Say</b> that this is referring to <b>those</b> women who are forbidden and would be <b>liable</b> to receive the penalty of <b><i>karet</i></b> as well, i.e., that these too may not enter into levirate marriage but nevertheless require <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “And if the man does not wish to take</b> his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7). This <b>implies</b> that if <b>he wishes, he takes her in levirate marriage; </b> it depends upon his wishes. However, <b>one who is eligible for levirate marriage is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>. And</b> conversely, <b>one who is ineligible for levirate marriage is ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and therefore does not require <i>ḥalitza</i> at all. Since those sex that carry a penalty of <i>karet</i> have no possibility of entering into levirate marriage, they do not require <i>ḥalitza</i> either. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “And if the man does not wish | Yevamot 39b:9 | <b>Rav said: </b> Nevertheless, the court <b>does not force</b> a <i>yavam</i> to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and if he wishes it is still permitted to consummate the levirate marriage. The Talmud relates: <b>When</b> a <i>yavam</i> and a <i>yevama</i> <b>would come before Rav, he would say to them: If you want, perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> and <b>if you want, consummate the levirate marriage, as God makes</b> the matter <b>dependent upon your</b> will, as it is stated: <b>“And if the man does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7) then he should perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. This implies that the Torah requires him to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> only if he does not wish to consummate the levirate marriage, <b>but if he wishes</b> to do so, then the matter is dependent upon him, and <b>if he wants, he performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> or <b>if he wants, he consummates the levirate marriage. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | recited this verse about him: “And if the man does not wish | Yevamot 41b:9 | To explain his ruling, R' Yosei <b>recited this verse about him: “And if the man does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7) in levirate marriage, then he must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. By inference, the possibility of performing <i>ḥalitza</i> exists only in a case in which <b>if he wishes he may consummate the levirate marriage. </b> This teaches the principle that <b>one who is eligible for levirate marriage is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> and one who is ineligible for levirate marriage is ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>. This includes even a woman who is temporarily prohibited from marrying, e.g., a woman in the first three months following a previous marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | does not wish | Yevamot 44a:8 | The Talmud suggests: <b>But let him consummate the levirate marriage with one and perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the other. </b> The Talmud explains that <b>the verse states: “If</b> the man <b>does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7), which implies that with regard to anyone who performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>were he to wish</b> to, <b>he could consummate the levirate marriage. </b> This teaches the principle that only <b>one who is eligible for levirate marriage is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> but <b>one who is ineligible for levirate marriage is ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>. </b> And since, in the case of the Mishnah, if the <i>yavam</i> consummated the levirate marriage with one of his brother’s wives he may not do so with the second, consequently he may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her either. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “And if the man does not wish | Yevamot 54a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>Didn’t you derive</b> from this phrase that the act of sex in this case is a <b>mitzva? </b> How can the same phrase also indicate that it does not matter what the intentions of the two parties were during the act of sex? The Talmud answers: The fact that it is <b>a mitzva is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And if the man does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7), which indicates that if he <b>wishes, he performs levirate marriage, </b> which is preferable to <i>ḥalitza</i>. Therefore, <b>when</b> the <b>verse</b> cited above <b>came, </b> it indicated that levirate marriage has occurred <b>whether</b> the parties acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “To establish a name for his brother” | Yevamot 54a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Didn’t you derive</b> from this phrase that levirate marriage has been performed if they engage in <b>typical</b> sex? How can it also indicate that it does not matter what the intentions of the two parties were during the act of sex? The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> a different verse: <b>“To establish a name for his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), which indicates that sex must occur <b>in the place where he establishes a name, </b> i.e., where it can lead to childbirth. Therefore, <b>when</b> the <b>verse</b> cited above <b>came, </b> it indicated that levirate marriage has occurred <b>whether</b> the parties acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | “To establish a name for his brother | Yevamot 79b:19 | The Talmud asks: Why does the mitzva of levirate marriage apply at all to a eunuch? <b>Read here</b> the verse with regard to levirate marriage: <b>“To establish a name for his brother</b> in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and this one is no</b> longer <b>capable of this, </b> even if previously he had an hour of fitness when he was fertile earlier in his life. |
| Deuteronomy 25:7 | his yevama | Yoma 13b:4 | <b>Rav Asi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Avira, strongly objects to</b> that conclusion: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, </b> that from the term: His house, in the singular, one derives one wife and not two, then <b>two widows of a brother who died without a child [<i>yevamot</i>] who come from one house, </b> i.e., they were married to the same man, should <b>not be</b> obligated <b>to</b> marry his brother in <b>levirate marriage. </b> In addressing levirate marriage, the Torah says: “So shall it be done to the man that does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). One may derive from this: One house, i.e., wife, and not two. The Talmud responds that when the Torah says: “Then <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> shall go up to the gate” (Deuteronomy 25:7), “and <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> will draw nigh to him” (Deuteronomy 25:9), twice, it comes to <b>include</b> a situation where the deceased had two wives; in that case one of them is required to marry his brother in levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | “And if he stands and he says: I do not wish to take her” | Moed Katan21a:1 | Rav Ashi challenged him: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, </b> one should be required to stand while performing the ritual through which the brother-in-law frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], as the verse states: <b>“And if he stands and he says: I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>Here</b> must he <b>also</b> stand for the ceremony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <i>ḥalitza</i> may be performed <b>whether</b> the man is <b>sitting, or standing, or reclining? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | “Then the elders of his city shall call him, | Sanhedrin 31b:15 | <b>Rav Kahana says: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this <i>halakha</i>? It is the verse that states: <b>“Then the elders of his city shall call him, </b> and speak to him, and if he stands and says: I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). The fact that the elders of his city, <b>and not the elders of her city, </b> are mentioned indicates that <i>ḥalitza</i> is performed in his city and not in hers. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | he says: “I do not wish to take her” | Sanhedrin 49b:10 | <b>And</b> if they decide to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>she says: “My brother-in-law refused</b> to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he says: “I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And they would say</b> these statements <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> Hebrew. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | he recites | Sanhedrin 49b:12 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that this is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | as it is stated: “And the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him” | Sanhedrin 49b:9 | <b>And</b> Rav Huna’s principle <b>excludes the mitzva of the ritual through which a man whose married brother dies childless [<i>yavam</i>] frees his late brother’s wife [<i>yevama</i>] of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>]; </b> i.e., it teaches that the order of that ceremony is not essential. <b>As we learned</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 106b): <b>The mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i></b> is performed in this manner: The <i>yavam</i> <b>and his <i>yevama</i> come before</b> the <b>court, </b> and the judges of the court <b>offer him advice that is appropriate for him</b> as to whether to enter levirate marriage or to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is stated: “And the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | Elders of | Yevamot 101a:12 | The Talmud discusses the dispute as to how many individuals must conduct the <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>, </b> who requires three? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>ḥalitza</i>: “His <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the <b>Elders”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7). Since the minimum number of the plural term “Elders” is <b>two, and</b> since, in order to prevent a paralyzing disagreement between an even number of judges, <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are three</b> judges. <b>And R' Yehuda</b> interprets the verse otherwise, for one verse states: “And the <b>Elders of</b> his city shall call him” (Deuteronomy 25:8), indicating a minimum of <b>two</b> judges, and it says in the following verse <b>“Elders”</b> another time, indicating an additional <b>two</b> people, <b>and</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are five</b> judges. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | of “he says” | Yevamot 104b:6 | The Talmud challenges again: <b>But didn’t</b> the scholars from the <b>house</b> of study <b>of R' Yannai say</b> that a deaf-mute man and woman are disqualified from participation in <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>because they cannot</b> fulfill the requirements <b>of “he says”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8) <b>and “she shall say”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), and not due to insufficient intellectual capacity? <b>Rather, when that</b> first statement <b>of Rava was said, it was stated</b> concerning <b>the latter clause</b> of the Mishnah: <b>If a deaf-mute man underwent <i>ḥalitza</i>, or a deaf-mute woman performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, or if a woman performs <i>ḥalitza</i> on a male minor, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | as it is stated: “And the Elders of his city shall call him and speak to him” | Yevamot 106b:1 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>The mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i></b> is performed as follows: <b>He and his <i>yevama</i> come to the court, and</b> the scholars of the court <b>give him advice appropriate for him, </b> whether to enter levirate marriage or to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is stated: “And the Elders of his city shall call him and speak to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | he says: “I do not wish to take her” | Yevamot 106b:2 | If they decide to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>she says: “My brother-in-law refused to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he says: “I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And they would say</b> these statements <b>in the sacred</b> Hebrew <b>language</b> and not in any other language. Afterward, the shoe is removed and she spits before him, as is written: <b>“His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), which indicates that <b>this spittle</b> must be <b>visible to the judges. “And</b> she shall <b>respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>Up until this point</b> the judges <b>would prompt</b> the parties <b>to recite</b> the text that they are required to say. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | he recites | Yevamot 106b:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said: </b> This is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), and afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us? This is</b> already explicit in <b>the Mishnah. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that <b>the mitzva is like this, </b> i.e., this is the proper order, <b>but if one switched the order, we have no</b> problem <b>with it, </b> as even though he did not fulfill the mitzva properly, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is still valid, since the order is not indispensable. |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | not” until “take her” | Yevamot 106b:9 | <b>He said to him: </b> Although Rava disagreed with Abaye about interruptions in the recitation of: “I do not wish to take her,” <b>Rava concedes concerning</b> the recitation of: <b>“He did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage, ”</b> as this recitation is essential and must be recited properly. Rav Kahana added that <b>Abaye</b> also <b>said: One who writes a bill of <i>ḥalitza</i> must write as follows: We prompted her to recite from “My brother-in-law refused” until “he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7); <b>and we prompted him to recite from</b> “I do <b>not” until “take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And we prompted her to recite from “So shall”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>until “he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:8 | “And the Elders of his city shall call him” | Yevamot 44a:3 | The Mishnah continues: If the eldest of them wished to consummate the levirate marriage with all of his <i>yevamot</i>, <b>he has permission</b> to do so. The Talmud asks: <b>Do they</b> actually <b>leave him</b> to do so? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the Elders of his city shall call him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8), which indicates that <b>they, </b> the Elders, <b>and not their agent, </b> should call him. The verse continues: <b>“And they speak to him”; </b> this phrase <b>teaches that they offer him advice that is appropriate for him. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | his foot [ raglo ]” | Arakhin 19b:10 | <b>But with regard to the ritual by which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], it is written: </b> “Then his brother’s wife shall approach…and loose his shoe from upon <b>his foot [<i>raglo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>and A baraita states</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 101a): In the case of a <i>yavam</i> who was missing part of his leg, if the <i>yevama</i> <b>performed the <i>ḥalitza</i></b> on any part of the leg <b>from the knee and below her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid. </b> This indicates that the term <i>regel</i> in the Torah means the leg from the foot up to the knee. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | The verse states: “So | Kiddushin 14a:10 | The Talmud further asks: <b>And let a <i>yevama</i> leave through a bill of divorce, </b> as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a married woman, who cannot leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, can leave through a bill of divorce, is it not logical</b> that <b>this</b> <i>yevama</i>, <b>who can leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, can</b> also <b>leave through a bill of divorce? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “So</b> shall it be done to the man” (Deuteronomy 25:9), with regard to the <i>ḥalitza</i> of a <i>yevama</i>, <b>and “so” precludes</b> another option. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | his shoe” | Kiddushin 14a:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>But this</b> term <b>“shoe, ” does it come</b> to teach <b>this? It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse said: “And remove <b>his shoe”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>his shoe</b> may be used. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the <b>shoe of any person</b> may also be used for <i>ḥalitza</i>? |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | with regard to the ritual through which the yavam , a man whose married brother died childless, frees his brother’s widow, the yevama , of her levirate bonds [ ḥalitza ], | Menachot 10a:7 | Similarly, when the verse states: “Of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy metzora, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“foot”</b> written here and <b>“foot”</b> written <b>with regard to the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i>, a man whose married brother died childless, frees his brother’s widow, the <i>yevama</i>, of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], </b> as the verse states with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And remove his shoe from upon his foot” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The verbal analogy teaches that the shoe is removed from his right foot. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | a yevama , | Niddah 55b:10 | The Talmud explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>saliva</b> in the verse “and if one who has an issue spits,” and the term <b>saliva</b> stated in connection with <b>a <i>yevama</i>, </b> a widow whose husband died childless and who participates in <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse states: “His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him” (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, the ritual is valid <b>even though</b> the saliva <b>did not touch</b> her brother-in-law, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the saliva of a <i>zav</i>, it transmits impurity despite the fact <b>that it did not</b> come into <b>contact</b> with the pure person. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the saliva of a <i>zav</i> transmits impurity only if it comes into contact with the pure person. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “His yevama shall approach him, before the elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him” | Sanhedrin 49b:11 | The verse states: <b>“His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). Accordingly, she removes his shoe and she spits before him a quantity of <b>spittle that is visible to the judges. “And she shall respond and say: So shall it be done to the man</b> who does not build his brother’s house. <b>And his name shall be called in Israel: </b> The house of he who had his shoe removed” (Deuteronomy 25:9–10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | and spits, and recites: | Sanhedrin 49b:12 | <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that this is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “And she shall speak and say” | Sotah 32a:8 | <b>How</b> is it derived that the recitation at <b>a <i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony must be in Hebrew? The verse in the Torah portion discussing <i>ḥalitza</i> states: <b>“And she shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>and below it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the Levites speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “And she shall speak and say: So | Sotah 32a:9 | <b>R' Yehuda says: </b> This can be derived from a different word in the verse: <b>“And she shall speak and say: So</b> shall it be done to the man that does not build up his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The word “so” indicates that her statement is ineffective <b>unless she says</b> it <b>in these</b> exact <b>words. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | a ḥalitza | Sotah 33a:15 | It is stated in the Mishnah: <b>How</b> is it derived that the recitation at <b>a <i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony must be in Hebrew? The verse states: “And she shall speak and say: So shall it be done to the man that doth not build up his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). R' Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: “And she shall speak and say: So” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Talmud asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis do with, </b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> word <b>“so”? They require</b> it <b>to</b> teach that any <b>matter</b> detailed in the portion <b>that is an action is indispensable</b> to the <i>ḥalitza</i> ceremony, as the verse states: “So shall it be done. ” However, the other aspects of the ritual, e.g., the recitations, are not indispensable, and in their absence the ritual is valid after the fact. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | ḥalitza | Sotah 33b:3 | <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says: Every place where it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>“So [<i>ko</i>], ”</b> or: <b>“So [<i>kakha</i>], ”</b> or where the language of <b>speaking and saying</b> is used, <b>it is</b> referring <b>only</b> to <b>the sacred tongue. </b> The word <b><i>ko</i></b> appears in the context of the Priestly Benediction: <b>“So [<i>ko</i>] you shall bless</b> the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:23). <b><i>Kakha</i></b> appears in the context <b>of</b> the <b><i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony (Deuteronomy 25:9). The language of <b>speaking and saying</b> appears in relation <b>to the Levites. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “Before the eyes of | Yevamot 101a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where does R' Yehuda derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <i>ḥalitza</i> can be done in the presence of <b>laymen? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>He derives it from</b> what is written: <b>“Before the eyes of</b> the Elders” (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>for the Master said: “Before the eyes of” excludes blind individuals</b> from being the judges conducting the <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | and spit | Yevamot 101b:1 | This is <b>as it is stated: “You are entirely beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7). If the Elders conducting <i>ḥalitza</i> needed to be expert judges, there would be no reason to explicitly exclude the blind, as they are unfit to be judges in a regular court. Evidently it is permitted for laymen to be judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>, and only blind individuals are excluded. The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse <b>“before the eyes of”? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes for</b> that which <b>Rava</b> taught, <b>as Rava said: The judges must see the spittle that exits from the mouth of the <i>yevama</i></b> as part of the ceremony of <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is written: </b> “His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, <b>before the eyes of the Elders, </b> and remove his shoe from on his foot <b>and spit</b> before him and respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | shoe? But the Torah said: “His shoe [ na’alo ]” | Yevamot 102a:9 | <b>He said to me: I saw that he</b> conducted <b><i>ḥalitza</i> many times. </b> I asked him: <b>Using a</b> soft leather <b>shoe or a</b> hard leather <b>sandal? He said to me: Does anyone</b> allow <b>performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with a</b> soft leather <b>shoe? But the Torah said: “His shoe [<i>na’alo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>and not: His shoe [<i>minalo</i>]. I said to him: If so, what did R' Meir see that</b> made <b>him say</b> that if <b>a woman performed <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a soft leather <b>shoe her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “And she shall remove [ ḥaltza ] his shoe from on his foot” | Yevamot 102b:8 | <b>Rav Kahana said to Shmuel: From where is it known that this</b> phrase: <b>“And she shall remove [<i>ḥaltza</i>] his shoe from on his foot”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>means to remove? As it is written: </b> “Then the priest shall command, <b>and they shall take out [<i>ḥiltzu</i>] the stones in which the plague is”</b> (Leviticus 14:40), indicating that the word <i>ḥaltza</i> means that they shall remove the stones from their place. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | from on his foot [ me’al raglo ]” | Yevamot 103a:12 | The Talmud answers: <b>It is different here, </b> with respect to <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is written: </b> “She removes the shoe <b>from on his foot [<i>me’al raglo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), which indicates that not only can his actual foot be used for performing <i>ḥalitza</i>, but also the part above it, i.e., the calf. The Talmud objects: <b>If that is so, </b> that one may use a part of his leg above his foot to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, then if one’s leg was amputated <b>from above the knee, </b> he should <b>also</b> be eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>; and yet, the same Mishnah taught that only one with a leg amputated from below the knee is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Talmud answers that the verse states: <b>“From on</b> his foot,” meaning above his foot, <b>but not: From on that which is on</b> his foot; the wording indicates that it can be above his foot until the knee, but not any further above that. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | his shoe | Yevamot 103b:4 | § It was taught in the Mishnah that <b>if she performed <i>ḥalitza</i> using a shoe that was not his, </b> the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid. <b>A baraita states: </b> From the verse “And remove <b>his shoe</b> from on his foot” (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>yavam</i> may wear <b>“his shoe, ”</b> i.e., a shoe that belongs to him; <b>from where</b> do I derive that he may wear <b>any person’s</b> shoe? <b>The verse states</b> the words <b>“shoe”</b> and <b>“shoe”</b> twice: “And remove his shoe” (Deuteronomy 25:9), and “The house of he who had his shoe removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10), to teach us that <b>in any case</b> it is acceptable, i.e., the shoes of another person may also be worn for <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “So shall it be done | Yevamot 104b:1 | <b>R' Elazar said to him: </b> The verse states: <b>“So shall it be done</b> to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). “So” is an exclusionary term indicating that only precisely in this fashion is <i>ḥalitza</i> valid. Therefore, <b>any term that constitutes an action</b> for <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>is indispensable. R' Akiva said to him: </b> You derive <b>proof from there? </b> But it states: <b>“So shall it be done to the man”</b> indicating that only <b>a term constituting an action toward the man, </b> namely any aspect of <i>ḥalitza</i> that concerns the man’s body, such as removal of his shoe, is indispensable. But spitting, which does not involve the man, although it takes place in his presence, is not indispensable. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | and “she shall say” | Yevamot 104b:6 | The Talmud challenges again: <b>But didn’t</b> the scholars from the <b>house</b> of study <b>of R' Yannai say</b> that a deaf-mute man and woman are disqualified from participation in <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>because they cannot</b> fulfill the requirements <b>of “he says”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8) <b>and “she shall say”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), and not due to insufficient intellectual capacity? <b>Rather, when that</b> first statement <b>of Rava was said, it was stated</b> concerning <b>the latter clause</b> of the Mishnah: <b>If a deaf-mute man underwent <i>ḥalitza</i>, or a deaf-mute woman performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, or if a woman performs <i>ḥalitza</i> on a male minor, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “so shall it be done” | Yevamot 105a:2 | The Talmud clarifies: <b>Who is</b> the author of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer, </b> could it be that he would hold that <b>if she removed</b> the shoe <b>but did not spit or did not recite</b> the verses, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid, </b> as stated in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>But didn’t R' Eliezer say: </b> The phrase <b>“so shall it be done”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) indicates that any <b>element</b> of the <i>ḥalitza</i> process <b>that</b> constitutes <b>an action is indispensable; </b> therefore spitting is necessary. <b>Rather, </b> it <b>is obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, and he teaches</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>if she spat but did not remove</b> the shoe <b>or did not recite</b> the text, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified. </b> The Talmud clarifies: <b>To whom</b> is the <i>yevama</i> disqualified from marrying after such a <i>ḥalitza</i>? |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | woman | Yevamot 105b:3 | <b>But the Rabbis say: “Man” is written in this</b> Torah <b>portion, </b> which indicates that an adult male must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, but with respect to the <b>woman</b> who removes the shoe, since the term woman is not used to describe her, but rather the more general term <i>yevama</i> is written, as the continuation of the above-mentioned verse says: “To take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>she may be either an adult or a female minor. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “His yevama shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him” | Yevamot 106b:2 | If they decide to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>she says: “My brother-in-law refused to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and</b> afterward <b>he says: “I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And they would say</b> these statements <b>in the sacred</b> Hebrew <b>language</b> and not in any other language. Afterward, the shoe is removed and she spits before him, as is written: <b>“His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), which indicates that <b>this spittle</b> must be <b>visible to the judges. “And</b> she shall <b>respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>Up until this point</b> the judges <b>would prompt</b> the parties <b>to recite</b> the text that they are required to say. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | and spits, and recites: | Yevamot 106b:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said: </b> This is the correct order for <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>: She recites</b> the sentence beginning with “My brother-in-law refused” (Deuteronomy 25:7), and afterward <b>he recites</b> “I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). Then <b>she removes</b> the shoe, <b>and spits, and recites: </b> “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us? This is</b> already explicit in <b>the Mishnah. </b> The Talmud answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that <b>the mitzva is like this, </b> i.e., this is the proper order, <b>but if one switched the order, we have no</b> problem <b>with it, </b> as even though he did not fulfill the mitzva properly, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is still valid, since the order is not indispensable. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | And we prompted her to recite from “So shall” | Yevamot 106b:9 | <b>He said to him: </b> Although Rava disagreed with Abaye about interruptions in the recitation of: “I do not wish to take her,” <b>Rava concedes concerning</b> the recitation of: <b>“He did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage, ”</b> as this recitation is essential and must be recited properly. Rav Kahana added that <b>Abaye</b> also <b>said: One who writes a bill of <i>ḥalitza</i> must write as follows: We prompted her to recite from “My brother-in-law refused” until “he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7); <b>and we prompted him to recite from</b> “I do <b>not” until “take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And we prompted her to recite from “So shall”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>until “he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | “Who does not build up | Yevamot 10b:8 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: Neither he nor the</b> other <b>brothers are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, neither for the <i>ḥalutza</i> nor for</b> having sex with <b>the rival wife. </b> The Talmud explains: <b>What is the rationale of Reish Lakish? The verse states</b> with regard to one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i>: <b>“Who does not build up</b> his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), which teaches that <b>since he did not build</b> his brother’s house by entering into levirate marriage, opting instead for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>he shall never build</b> it <b>again. </b> This statement is understood not only as a negative description of events, but also as a prohibition against marrying this woman at any point in the future. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | a positive mitzva. | Yevamot 11a:7 | <b>It was stated</b> that there is a similar dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to <b>one</b> who <b>had sex with</b> his <b><i>yevama</i></b> and thereby performed the mitzva of levirate marriage as required, <b>and one of the</b> other <b>brothers had sex with her rival wife. Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree</b> with regard to this matter. <b>One said: </b> The second brother is liable <b>to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>. And</b> the other <b>one said</b> that he is in violation <b>of</b> only <b>a positive mitzva. </b> The verse: “Who does not build up his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), is a positive mitzva, as it teaches that one house may be built up, but not two houses, i.e., no more than one wife of a deceased brother may be married by one of his brothers. Any mitzva formulated as a positive injunction has the status of a positive mitzva, even if it is violated by the performance of an action, in the manner of a prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | who does not build | Yevamot 32a:3 | <b>Rather, </b> the requirement to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with both women is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that was instituted <b>lest he first perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with one of his brother’s wives <b>and subsequently consummate the levirate marriage</b> with the other. Under such circumstances, he would in fact be violating a prohibition. Once he performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with the first woman <b>he is subject to</b> the prohibition indicated by the verse “So shall it be done to the man <b>who does not build</b> his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). In this verse <b>God states</b> that <b>once he did not build</b> his brother’s house but rather opted to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with one of his brother’s wives, <b>he may not proceed to build</b> it by consummating the levirate marriage with a different wife. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | who does not build his brother’s house” | Yevamot 44a:6 | § The Mishnah states: In the case of <b>one who was married</b> to two women and died childless, the sex or <i>ḥalitza</i> of either one of them with the <i>yavam</i> releases her rival wife from the levirate bond. The Talmud questions why the Mishnah considers only the possibility that he would do so with only one of the women: <b>But let him</b> instead <b>consummate levirate marriages with both of them. R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: The verse states</b> that a <i>yavam</i> who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> is referred to as: “The man <b>who does not build his brother’s house”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). The fact that the word “house” appears in the singular indicates that even had he instead chosen to consummate a levirate marriage, only <b>one house may he build, </b> by consummating a levirate marriage with one of his brother’s wives, <b>but he may not build two houses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | of: “He does not build | Yevamot 44a:9 | <b>And furthermore, </b> an additional reason that one may not do so is so <b>that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that the brother’s <b>house was partially built</b> through levirate marriage <b>and partially released through <i>ḥalitza</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> even if <b>they will say</b> that, what of it? The Talmud explains: <b>If he</b> first <b>consummated the levirate marriage</b> with one wife <b>and subsequently performed <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with the other, <b>indeed, </b> there is no reason not to do this. <b>However, perhaps he</b> might first <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with one wife <b>and subsequently consummate levirate marriage</b> with the other, <b>and</b> by doing so <b>he is liable for</b> a violation of the prohibition <b>of: “He does not build</b> his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The verse indicates that one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> has not built his brother’s house and is therefore subsequently prohibited from attempting to do so by consummating a levirate marriage with either the <i>ḥalutza</i> or any of her rival wives. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | will come to engage in intercourse after ḥalitza , | Yevamot 50b:7 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason that the rabbis said</b> that <b>a bill of divorce is effective for a <i>yevama</i>, </b> despite the fact that she is not his wife? This is <b>because it is effective in general</b> in cases of married women. <b>For if you say</b> that <b>it is not effective</b> in the case of a <i>yevama</i>, there are some who might mistakenly <b>say</b> the following: <b>A bill of divorce</b> is given to a woman in order <b>to remove her</b> from her husband, <b>and <i>ḥalitza</i></b> likewise serves <b>to remove her</b> from the <i>yavam</i>; <b>since a bill of divorce is ineffective</b> for this <i>yevama</i>, <b><i>ḥalitza</i> is also ineffective</b> and does not sever their relationship completely. <b>And</b> perhaps the <i>yavam</i> <b>will come to have sex after <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> which is forbidden by the Torah prohibition derived from the verse: “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | a prohibition. | Yevamot 52b:4 | § It was taught in the Mishnah: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> and</b> then <b>performed levirate betrothal, </b> nothing is effective after <i>ḥalitza</i> and this levirate betrothal is not valid. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is the statement of R' Akiva, who says</b> that <b>betrothal does not take effect on</b> those who are forbidden as they are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition. </b> Once he has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, the woman is forbidden to him due to the prohibition derived from the verse “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), and betrothal is ineffective. <b>But the Rabbis say something is</b> effective <b>after <i>ḥalitza</i>. </b> Although the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> is forbidden to him, if he does betroth her, his betrothal is effective, as with any regular prohibition. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | is liable due to a prohibition | Yevamot 53a:12 | § It was taught in the Mishnah: Nothing is effective after <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>both</b> in cases of <b>one <i>yavam</i> to two <i>yevamot</i>, </b> as well as cases of two <i>yevamin</i> to one <i>yevama</i>. The Talmud comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yoḥanan, who said</b> that once a <i>yavam</i> has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i>, <b>the entire household, </b> the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> as well as her rival wives, <b>is liable due to a prohibition</b> derived from the verse “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), but the women are not liable to <i>karet</i> due to the prohibition with regard to a brother’s wife. In light of R' Yoḥanan’s ruling, <b>it was necessary to teach us that betrothal does not take effect on</b> the rival wife of the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, despite the fact that she is only <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition, </b> in accordance with the opinion of R' Akiva. |
| Deuteronomy 25:9 | levirate marriage. | Yoma 13b:4 | <b>Rav Asi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Avira, strongly objects to</b> that conclusion: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, </b> that from the term: His house, in the singular, one derives one wife and not two, then <b>two widows of a brother who died without a child [<i>yevamot</i>] who come from one house, </b> i.e., they were married to the same man, should <b>not be</b> obligated <b>to</b> marry his brother in <b>levirate marriage. </b> In addressing levirate marriage, the Torah says: “So shall it be done to the man that does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). One may derive from this: One house, i.e., wife, and not two. The Talmud responds that when the Torah says: “Then <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> shall go up to the gate” (Deuteronomy 25:7), “and <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> will draw nigh to him” (Deuteronomy 25:9), twice, it comes to <b>include</b> a situation where the deceased had two wives; in that case one of them is required to marry his brother in levirate marriage. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | shoe | Kiddushin 14a:17 | <b>Rather, </b> the Talmud suggests a different explanation as to why a bill of divorce is ineffective for a <i>yevama</i>. With regard to a <i>yevama</i> <b>the verse states: </b> “The house of him who had his <b>shoe</b> removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10), which teaches: If she is released by the <i>ḥalitza</i> of the <b>shoe, yes, </b> she is released from the <i>yavam</i>, but if she was released by means of <b>something else, no, </b> she is not released. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of him who had his shoe removed” | Kiddushin 14a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches that the <i>yevama</i> acquires herself <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to levirate marriage, after the <i>yavam</i> has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>“And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of him who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). This indicates: <b>Once</b> his <b>shoe is removed by her, she is permitted to all of Israel. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “in Israel” is written twice | Kiddushin 14a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>This</b> term <b>“Israel, ” does it come</b> to teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is required for that which is taught</b> by <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda: </b> The verse says <b>“in Israel”</b> to teach that <i>ḥalitza</i> may be performed only <b>in a Jewish court, but not in a non-Jew court. </b> The Talmud answers that the phrase <b>“in Israel” is written twice</b> in that chapter: “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10), and: “To establish a name for his brother in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:7). A different <i>halakha</i> is derived from each of these instances. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | answer and say: The one whose shoe was removed, the one whose shoe was removed. | Kiddushin 14a:5 | The Talmud asks: <b>But still, we</b> also <b>require</b> the additional term “in Israel” <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>R' Yehuda said: Once we were sitting before R' Tarfon and a <i>yevama</i> came to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. And</b> R' Tarfon <b>said to us</b> after the <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>All of you</b> should <b>answer and say: The one whose shoe was removed, the one whose shoe was removed. </b> This indicates that the phrase: “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10), teaches that the matter must be announced and publicized throughout the nation. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is not derived from the phrase “in Israel. ” Rather, <b>it is derived from: “And his name shall be called, ”</b> which indicates that it must be announced that this is his name. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “In Israel” | Yevamot 101b:16 | It is told: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda was standing before Rav Yehuda. </b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Go up to the bundle of reeds to complete the</b> quorum of <b>five in order to publicize the matter</b> of this <i>ḥalitza</i>. Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>said to him: We learned</b> that the phrase <b>“In Israel”</b> in the verse: “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10) indicates that <i>ḥalitza</i> must be performed <b>before a court of Israelites</b> from birth, <b>and not before a court</b> composed o<b>f converts, but I am a convert, </b> as Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda had converted along with his father. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “In Israel,” | Yevamot 101b:2 | The Talmud asks: If so, <b>the other</b> Sage, R' Yehuda, should <b>also require</b> “before the eyes” <b>to</b> teach <b>Rava’s</b> statement. The Talmud answers: <b>Yes, </b> this <b>is so, </b> as R' Yehuda understands “before the eyes” as requiring the judges to see the spittle. <b>But</b> then <b>from where does he derive</b> the eligibility of <b>laymen? </b> He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“In Israel, ”</b> in the verse “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10), which indicates that <b>any Israelite, </b> even one who is not an expert judge, may preside over <i>ḥalitza</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | you should all respond: “He who had his shoe removed.” | Yevamot 101b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, R' Yehuda, from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Talmud answers: <b>“In Israel” is written another</b> time as well (Deuteronomy 25:7, 10), and that is the source of this principle. <b>And the other, </b> the first <i>tanna</i>, what does he do with this additional “In Israel”? The Talmud explains: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>R' Yehuda said: Once we were sitting</b> in study <b>before R' Tarfon, and a <i>yevama</i> came to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and he said to us: </b> After the <i>ḥalitza</i> is completed, <b>you should all respond: “He who had his shoe removed. ”</b> He understands the verse “His name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10) to mean that all those who witness the <i>ḥalitza</i> must respond: “He who had his shoe removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “And his name shall be called in Israel: | Yevamot 102a:2 | <b>And if the</b> convert’s <b>mother was from Israel, he may even</b> preside as a judge in a court to <b>adjudicate</b> legal matters involving a native-born <b>Jew. But with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, </b> he may not act as a judge <b>unless both his father and his mother were from Israel</b> from birth, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>“And his name shall be called in Israel: </b> The house of he who had his shoe removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10), implying that he must be born as a member of the Jewish people from both of his parents. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of he who had his shoe removed” | Yevamot 106b:3 | <b>And when R' Hyrkanus once prompted</b> the participants in <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>under the <i>ela</i> tree in the village</b> of <b>Eitam, he</b> prompted them to <b>finish reciting the whole</b> Torah <b>passage, </b> after which <b>they established the custom of completing the whole</b> Torah <b>passage. </b> Therefore, they continue and say the following verse: <b>“And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). <b>This mitzva</b> of saying: The house of he who had his shoe removed, applies <b>to the judges, but not to the students, </b> i.e., the students of the judges and other onlookers who are present. <b>R' Yehuda says: It is a mitzva upon all those present to say: He who had his shoe removed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | until “he who had his shoe removed” | Yevamot 106b:9 | <b>He said to him: </b> Although Rava disagreed with Abaye about interruptions in the recitation of: “I do not wish to take her,” <b>Rava concedes concerning</b> the recitation of: <b>“He did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage, ”</b> as this recitation is essential and must be recited properly. Rav Kahana added that <b>Abaye</b> also <b>said: One who writes a bill of <i>ḥalitza</i> must write as follows: We prompted her to recite from “My brother-in-law refused” until “he did not wish to consummate the levirate marriage”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7); <b>and we prompted him to recite from</b> “I do <b>not” until “take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>And we prompted her to recite from “So shall”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>until “he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | this is Rabbi Akiva’s reasoning: As the verse states: “The house of he who had his shoe removed” | Yevamot 44a:22 | <b>Rather, </b> the Mishnah should not be emended, and with regard to the Talmud’s original question as to how R' Akiva could claim that the offspring from one’s union with a relative of his <i>ḥalutza</i> is a <i>mamzer</i> if that union is forbidden only by rabbinic law, one must conclude that <b>a relative of one’s <i>ḥalutza</i></b> is forbidden by Torah law <b>according to R' Akiva</b> and therefore the offspring <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>. R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>this is R' Akiva’s reasoning: As the verse states: “The house of he who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). <b>The verse called</b> his relationship with the <i>ḥalutza</i> <b>his house, </b> indicating that the <i>ḥalutza</i> is considered as though she had been married to the <i>yavam</i>, and therefore her relative is forbidden to him by Torah law. |
| Deuteronomy 25:10 | “The house of him who had his shoe removed” | Yevamot 44a:7 | The Talmud suggests: <b>But let him perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them; </b> why does the Mishnah state that he does so with only one woman? <b>Mar Zutra bar Toviya said: The verse states</b> that following the <i>ḥalitza</i> the man is called: <b>“The house of him who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). The fact that the word “house” appears in the singular indicates that <b>he performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> only <b>one house, </b> i.e., only one of his brother’s wives, <b>and he does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with two houses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | From the fact that it is stated: “And she extended her hand” | Bava Kamma27a:6 | The <i>halakha</i> that one is exempt from paying compensation for humiliation unless he intended to strike his victim is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And she extended her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>do I not know that she took</b> hold of something? Consequently, <b>what</b> is the meaning when further on in <b>the verse</b> it <b>states: “And she took</b> him by his genitals”? It is <b>to teach you that one who intends to cause damage, even if he does not intend to humiliate</b> the injured party, is nevertheless liable to pay compensation for humiliation. |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | “And extended her hand” | Bava Kamma28a:18 | The Talmud asks: <b>But if she cannot save</b> him <b>by other means, </b> is it possible that <b>she</b> is <b>exempt? If so, instead of teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> that the expression mentioned in the previous verse: <b>“And extended her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>excludes an emissary of the court, </b> who is authorized to act in this manner and is therefore exempt from paying restitution, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the case under discussion in the verse <b>itself, </b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the wife is liable <b>said? </b> It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where she can save</b> her husband <b>by another means. But</b> if <b>she cannot save</b> him <b>by other means, she</b> is <b>exempt. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | humiliation, | Bava Kamma42a:9 | <b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, </b> then <b>with regard to</b> compensation for <b>humiliation, </b> which is derived from the verse: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one drew near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who smites him, and extended her hand, and grabbed his genitals” (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>let us say this as well: </b> Only <b>men</b> are liable to pay for humiliation, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen, </b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>And for</b> humiliation caused by <b>innocuous oxen, </b> their owners <b>are</b> also <b>exempt</b> due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>God then wrote</b> that <b>the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox shall be clear, </b> indicating that only for <b>an innocuous</b> ox is one <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for humiliation, <b>but</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox the owner is <b>liable. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | as it is written: “And she put forth her hand, and took him by his genitals” | Bava Kamma86a:17 | The Talmud explains R' Shimon’s statement: <b>What is the reason</b> for exempting one who humiliated a person whom he did not intend to humiliate? The <i>halakha</i> of humiliation is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>killing. Just as</b> in a case of <b>killing, </b> the murderer is not executed <b>unless he intended</b> to kill the victim specifically, <b>as it is written: “And he lies in wait for him, and rises up against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:11), which means he is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to kill <b>him</b> specifically, so <b>too, </b> in a case of <b>humiliation, </b> the one who humiliated is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically, <b>as it is written: “And she put forth her hand, and took him by his genitals”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11); this teaches that one is not liable for humiliation <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically. |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | “When men strive together, a man and his brother” | Bava Kamma88a:3 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to others</b> is <b>liable</b> for all of the five types of indemnity. R' Yehuda says: Canaanite slaves do not have humiliation, so one who injures a slave pays only the other four types of indemnity. <b>What is the reasoning of R' Yehuda? </b> The Talmud explains: The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the indemnity of humiliation: <b>“When men strive together, a man and his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11). The formulation “and his brother” teaches that the payment of compensation for humiliation is applicable <b>with regard to someone who has</b> a relationship of <b>brotherhood</b> with a Jew. This is <b>excluding</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, who does not have</b> a relationship of <b>brotherhood</b> with Jews. <b>And the rabbis, </b> who hold that a Canaanite slave is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of compensation for humiliation, maintain that <b>he is</b> the Jews’ <b>brother with regard to</b> the observance of <b>mitzvot, </b> as a Canaanite slave is obligated to observe most mitzvot. |
| Deuteronomy 25:11 | states: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, | Sanhedrin 86a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yehuda? </b> It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, </b> and the wife of the one drew near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who smites him, and extended her hand, and grabbed his genitals” (Deuteronomy 25:11). This is the source for liability to pay restitution for humiliating another. From the term “his brother” it is derived that <b>one who has brotherhood, </b> i.e., who is halakhically related to his biological family, receives payment for humiliation. <b>A slave is excluded, as he has no brotherhood, </b> i.e., he is not halakhically related to his family. |
| Deuteronomy 25:12 | “Then you shall cut off her hand” | Bava Kamma28a:17 | The Talmud suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>, which relates to the case of a woman who, during a fight between her husband and another man, grabs the other man’s genitals: The verse that states: <b>“Then you shall cut off her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:12), should not be taken literally; rather, it is referring to <b>monetary restitution. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she cannot save</b> her husband from his attacker <b>by a means other</b> than grabbing the attacker’s genitals, and nevertheless she is punished? This indicates that one may not take justice into his own hands. The Talmud answers: <b>No, </b> the verse is referring to a case <b>where she can save</b> him <b>by other means. </b> Otherwise she is exempt from paying restitution. |
| Deuteronomy 25:12 | “Your eye | Bava Kamma86b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reasoning of R' Yehuda? </b> He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy to: <b>“Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 25:12), stated with regard to humiliation, <b>from: “Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 19:21), stated with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses. </b> The analogy teaches that <b>just as there, </b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of conspiring witnesses, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included, as blind people cannot see events occur in order to testify, <b>so too here, </b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of compensation for humiliation, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included. |
| Deuteronomy 25:14 | Rav Yehuda of Sura says | Bava Batra89a:7 | <b>Rav Yehuda of Sura says</b> a homiletic interpretation of the phrase: “You shall not have in your house diverse measures” (Deuteronomy 25:14): <b>“You shall not have in your house”</b> means that you will become a pauper, who has nothing in his house. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to</b> the fact that you used <b>diverse measures, </b> buying with a large vessel and selling with a small one. |
| Deuteronomy 25:15 | “A perfect and just [ tzedek ] weight” | Bava Batra88b:3 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters, </b> that the seller must initially let the scales tilt an extra handbreadth, <b>derived? Reish Lakish said: </b> The source is <b>that the verse states</b> that one should have: <b>“A perfect and just [<i>tzedek</i>] weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which is interpreted as an instruction to the seller: <b>Be righteous [<i>tzaddek</i>] with that which is yours and give it to</b> the buyer. The Talmud asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause: </b> If the seller <b>weighed for him exactly, he gives</b> the buyer <b>additional amounts. But if letting</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> is obligatory <b>by Torah law, how can he</b> originally <b>give him</b> by weighing <b>exactly? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:15 | The verse states: “A perfect weight” | Bava Batra89a:3 | <b>A baraita states: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not level</b> a measuring vessel <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>heap</b> it <b>and</b> that <b>one may not heap</b> it <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>level</b> it? <b>The verse states: “A perfect weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which indicates that one must use whatever is considered a perfect measuring vessel in that locale, as this ensures that there is no deception or trickery. |
| Deuteronomy 25:15 | does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight you shall have” | Bava Batra89a:4 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the seller <b>said in a place where they heap: I am hereby leveling and</b> am willing in exchange <b>to reduce the price for</b> you, or said, <b>in a place where they level: I am hereby heaping and</b> am willing <b>to increase the price for</b> you, <b>that</b> the court <b>does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight you shall have”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15). The addition of the term “just,” beyond the requirement that the weight be “perfect,” teaches that one must keep his weights in a just manner, i.e., that employed by the people of that locale. |
| Deuteronomy 25:15 | balance with precision? The verse states: “A perfect weight” | Bava Batra89a:5 | <b>A baraita states: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not</b> balance a scale so that it will <b>balance with precision [<i>me’ayyenin</i>] in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth for the benefit of the buyer, <b>and</b> that <b>one may not let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>balance with precision? The verse states: “A perfect weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the weight must be considered perfect in that locale. |
| Deuteronomy 25:15 | does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight” | Bava Batra89a:6 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a seller <b>said, in a place where</b> it is the custom to <b>let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth: <b>I am hereby balancing with precision and</b> am willing <b>to reduce the price for</b> the buyer; <b>or, in a place where</b> it is the custom to <b>balance with precision: I am hereby letting</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth <b>and</b> am willing <b>to increase the price for</b> the buyer, <b>that</b> the court <b>does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the just way of acting is to weigh in accordance with the practice in that locale. |
| Deuteronomy 25:16 | “ Elleh ,” | Bava Batra88b:6 | § <b>R' Levi says: The punishment for</b> using false <b>measures is more severe than the punishment for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>forbidden sexual sex. As</b> in <b>that</b> case, forbidden sex, it <b>is stated with regard to them</b> a shortened term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>El</i>, ”</b> in the verse: “For all these [<i>el</i> ] abominations” (Leviticus 18:27). <b>And</b> in <b>this</b> case, false measures, it <b>is stated</b> an expanded term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>Elleh</i>, ”</b> in the verse: “For all that do these [<i>elleh</i>] things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 25:16). <b>And from where may it be inferred that this</b> expression <b>“<i>el</i>”</b> indicates that the prohibition <b>is severe, </b> based on which it is understood that the form this word takes indicates a level of severity? <b>As it is written: “And the mighty [<i>eilei</i>] of the land he took away”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13). |
| Deuteronomy 25:16 | is stated: “These [ eleh ]” | Yevamot 21a:6 | The Talmud asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this statement <b>contradicts</b> the opinion of <b>R' Levi? As R' Levi said: The harshness of the punishment for</b> using dishonest <b>measures is more than the punishment for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>forbidden relationships, as</b> with regard to <b>this, </b> forbidden sex, it <b>is stated</b> only: <b>“These [<i>el</i>], ” whereas</b> with regard to <b>that, </b> dishonest measures, it <b>is stated: “These [<i>eleh</i>]”</b> with an additional letter <i>heh</i> as a suffix: “For all that do these [<i>eleh</i>] things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 25:16). This implies that the word <i>eleh</i> indicates harshness and not the word <i>el</i>. The Talmud answers: This does not contradict his opinion. The word <b><i>el</i></b> has the connotation of <b>harsh, but <i>eleh</i></b> has the connotation of even <b>harsher than <i>el</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:17 | “Remember | Megillah 18a:13 | The Talmud raises a question: <b>But from where</b> do we know <b>that this remembrance</b> that is stated with regard to Amalek and to the Megilla involves <b>reading</b> it out loud from a book? <b>Perhaps</b> it requires <b>merely looking into</b> the book, reading it silently. The Talmud answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Remember</b> what Amalek did to you” (Deuteronomy 25:17). One <b>might</b> have thought that it suffices for one to remember this silently, <b>in his heart. </b> But this cannot be, since <b>when it says</b> subsequently: <b>“You shall not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19), <b>it is</b> already <b>referring to forgetting from the heart. How, </b> then, <b>do I uphold</b> the meaning of <b>“remember”? </b> What does this command to remember add to the command to not forget? Therefore, it means that the remembrance must be expressed out loud, <b>with the mouth. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 25:18 | As it is written: “And you were faint and weary” | Moed Katan2a:7 | The Talmud raises a question with regard to a linguistic issue: <b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit hashelaḥin</i>, </b> a field that requires irrigation, <b>is a term</b> denoting <b>thirst, </b> implying that supplementary watering is necessary? The Talmud answers: <b>As it is written: “And you were faint and weary”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:18). The term faint is referring to the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. <b>And, </b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And you were thirsty [<i>meshalhei</i>] and weary. </b> The letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i> are sometimes interchanged, and therefore the term <i>beit hashelaḥin</i> connotes a thirsty field. |
| Deuteronomy 25:19 | “You shall blot out the remembrance [ zekher ] of Amalek” | Bava Batra21b:1 | <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did that? </b> Why did you kill only the males? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: You shall blot out the males [<i>zakhar</i>] of Amalek, </b> i.e., the male descendants of Amalek, who descend from Edom. David <b>said to him: But we read</b> the verse as stating: <b>“You shall blot out the remembrance [<i>zekher</i>] of Amalek”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19). Joab <b>said to him: I was taught to read it as <i>zakhar</i>. </b> Joab <b>went and asked his</b> childhood Bible <b>teacher. </b> Joab <b>said to him: How did you read</b> this word <b>to us? </b> The teacher <b>said to him: </b> I read it as <b><i>zekher</i>. </b> The teacher had read it the proper way, but he failed to notice that his student had learned it incorrectly. |
| Deuteronomy 25:19 | “You shall not forget” | Megillah 18a:13 | The Talmud raises a question: <b>But from where</b> do we know <b>that this remembrance</b> that is stated with regard to Amalek and to the Megilla involves <b>reading</b> it out loud from a book? <b>Perhaps</b> it requires <b>merely looking into</b> the book, reading it silently. The Talmud answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Remember</b> what Amalek did to you” (Deuteronomy 25:17). One <b>might</b> have thought that it suffices for one to remember this silently, <b>in his heart. </b> But this cannot be, since <b>when it says</b> subsequently: <b>“You shall not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19), <b>it is</b> already <b>referring to forgetting from the heart.

| Deuteronomy 26:2 | as Rabbi Yosei teaches: | Arakhin 11a:15 | The Talmud answers: <b>You can find</b> cases where the first fruits are brought in the form of wine, <b>as R' Yosei teaches: </b> The verse states with regard to the first fruits: “You shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Since the verse mentions “fruit,” <b>you</b> must <b>bring</b> the actual <b>fruit</b> as your first fruits offering, <b>and you may not bring</b> it in the form of <b>beverages. </b> If one <b>brought grapes and</b> he had already <b>pressed them</b> into wine, <b>from where</b> is it derived that he has fulfilled his obligation of offering his first fruits? <b>The verse states: “You shall bring in</b> from your land. ” This apparently superfluous phrase comes to teach that if one brings wine for the mitzva of first fruits, he has fulfilled his obligation. |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | But isn’t it written: “Which you shall bring in from your land” | Bava Batra81a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Which you shall bring in from your land”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2)? This verse indicates that the fruit must be the produce of your land, not land that belongs to another. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> land that is <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, which is not the land of the Jewish people. It does not exclude land that does not belong to that specific individual. |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | What is the reason? As it is written: And you shall take, and you shall bring. | Bava Batra81b:8 | The Talmud answers: The case is <b>where he renders them</b> exempt from the obligation of recitation, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina, who says: </b> If one <b>harvested</b> the fruits <b>and sent them in the possession of an agent, and</b> the <b>agent died on the way, </b> the owner or any other person <b>brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passage of thanks. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: And you shall take, and you shall bring. </b> The Talmud is citing from the following verse with a slight variation: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that YHWH your God gives you” (Deuteronomy 26:2). |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | fruit | Chullin 120b:7 | The Talmud answers that first fruits can be brought as wine, <b>as R' Yosei teaches: </b> The verse states with regard to first fruits: “You shall take of the first of all the <b>fruit</b> of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Since the verse mentions fruit, this indicates that <b>you must bring</b> actual <b>fruit, and you may not bring</b> the first fruits in the form of <b>beverages. </b> But if one <b>brought grapes and</b> he had already <b>pressed them</b> into wine, <b>from where</b> is it derived that he has fulfilled his obligation? <b>The verse states: “You shall bring in</b> from your land. ” This superfluous term serves to teach that if one brings wine for the mitzva of first fruits, he has fulfilled his obligation. |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | your land [ be’artzekha ]” | Chullin 136a:7 | Similarly, with regard to the <b>first fruits, </b> R' Ilai concedes that the joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written: </b> “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from <b>your land [<i>be’artzekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2), using the singular pronoun. One might have inferred from the singular pronoun that with regard to <b>your</b> land, <b>yes, </b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | from the first | Menachot 84b:13 | The Talmud discusses the dispute: <b>Granted, </b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> is well founded, <b>as he stated the reason</b> for his ruling. <b>But</b> as for <b>R' Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>R' Elazar said: </b> I have an explanation of R' Yoḥanan’s ruling and since <b>I</b> was privileged to <b>see R' Yoḥanan in a dream, </b> I know that <b>I am saying a proper matter. The verse states</b> with regard to first fruits: “And you shall take <b>from the first</b> of all the fruit” (Deuteronomy 26:2). The addition of the word “from” indicates that one should take from some of the first fruits, <b>but not</b> from <b>all the first</b> fruits. This teaches that one should use only the seven species for the mitzva. The verse continues: “That you shall bring <b>from your land. ”</b> The addition of the word “from” indicates that one should take first fruits from some areas of the land, <b>but not</b> from <b>all</b> areas in <b>your land. </b> This teaches that one should not take dates from the mountains or produce from the valleys. |
| Deuteronomy 26:2 | land” is stated here | Menachot 84b:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, </b> for <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does he use this</b> term <b>“your land”? </b> He holds that the term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel, son of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says: </b> “From your <b>land” is stated here</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2), with regard to the first fruits, <b>and “land” is stated there</b> with regard to the praise of Eretz Yisrael: “A land of wheat and barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), which are the seven species. This serves as the basis for a verbal analogy and teaches that <b>just as there, </b> the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so too, here, </b> with regard to the mitzva to bring the first fruits, the verse is referring only to the produce that is the <b>praise of Eretz</b> Yisrael, i.e., the seven species. |
| Deuteronomy 26:3 | “And you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days” | Kiddushin 66b:12 | <b>R' Yannai said: </b> The source is <b>from here, </b> a verse stated with regard to first fruits: <b>“And you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:3). <b>But can it enter your mind that a person can come to a priest who is not</b> alive <b>in his days? </b> What then is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? <b>Rather, this</b> is referring to <b>a fit</b> priest <b>who</b> later <b>became</b> established as <b>a <i>ḥalal</i>. </b> All his previous days of service are considered those of a fit priest. |
| Deuteronomy 26:3 | that the Lord swore unto our fathers” | Makkot 19a:6 | <b>Rav Ashi said: </b> There is no proof from the fact that recitation is not mentioned. <b>Although</b> the lack of recitation <b>does not invalidate</b> the first fruits, <b>is there no mitzva? </b> Everyone agrees that there is a mitzva to recite the Torah verses. <b>And</b> therefore <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to recite the portion; <b>and refute</b> the proof from first fruits in that manner, as in the case of second tithe there is no mitzva to recite Torah verses. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that there is a different reason that recitation was omitted from the refutation: It is <b>that there is</b> the case of <b>the first fruits of a convert, who needs to recite: </b> “I have come to the land <b>that YHWH swore unto our fathers”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:3), <b>and</b> since <b>he cannot say</b> it, as YHWH did not swear to give the land to the ancestors of the convert, he brings the first fruits but does not read the portion. Therefore, the obligation to recite the Torah verses <b>is not clear-cut for</b> the <i>tanna</i> and he did not mention it. |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | and place it | Makkot 18b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the statement of <b>R' Yehuda? </b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse written in the portion of first fruits: <b>“And you shall place it</b> before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10), that the reference is not to the placement of the fruits alongside the altar; rather, <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving</b> the first fruits. <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> a reference <b>only</b> to <b>actual placement</b> of the first fruits? He explains: <b>When it states</b> earlier: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand <b>and place it</b> before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>placement</b> alongside the altar <b>is</b> already <b>stated; how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“And you shall place it”? This</b> is a reference to <b>waving. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” | Makkot 18b:13 | The Talmud clarifies: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with R' Yehuda? It is R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse written in the portion of first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4); this verse <b>taught about first fruits that they require waving, </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” | Makkot 18b:14 | The Talmud explains: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy from one instance of the word <b>“hand”</b> written with regard to first fruits and <b>from</b> another instance of the word <b>“hand”</b> written with regard to <b>a peace-offering. It is written here, </b> with regard to first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>and it is written</b> with regard to a peace-offering: “He who offers his peace-offering to God…<b>his hands shall bring it, the fire of God…</b>to raise it as a waving before God” (Leviticus 7:29–30). <b>Just as here, </b> in the case of first fruits, it is the <b>priest</b> who takes the basket in his hand and waves it, <b>so too there, </b> in the case of the peace-offering, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving. <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to a peace-offering, it is the <b>owner</b> who performs the waving, as it is written: “He who offers…his hands shall bring it,” <b>so too here, </b> the <b>owner</b> waves the first fruits. <b>How so; </b> how can the waving be performed by both the priest and the owner? The <b>priest places his hands beneath the hands of the owner and waves</b> the first fruits together with the owner. |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | “And the priest shall take | Menachot 61a:15 | § The Mishnah teaches: <b>The first fruits</b> also require waving, <b>in accordance with the statement of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the statement of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </b> alluded to here? The Talmud answers that it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the basket from your hand, and place it before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4). This <b>taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning the first fruits, that they require waving; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” | Menachot 61a:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </b> as the verse is not explicitly referring to waving? The Talmud explains: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy from <b>“hand, ”</b> written with regard to first fruits, and <b>from “hand, ”</b> written with regard to <b>a peace offering. It is written here, </b> with regard to first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>and it is written there: </b> offering “He who offers his peace offering to God…<b>his hands shall bring it, </b> the fire of God…to raise it as a waving before God” (Leviticus 7:29–30). |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | and place it | Menachot 61b:3 | He explains: <b>When it states</b> earlier: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand, <b>and place it</b> before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>placement</b> alongside the altar <b>is</b> already <b>stated; how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And you shall place it”? This</b> is a reference to <b>waving. </b> It is therefore clear that R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov is not the only <i>tanna</i> who holds that there is a requirement of waving the first fruits, as indicated by the Mishnah; R' Yehuda also maintains this opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | since the verse opened first with | Menachot 61b:4 | <b>Rava says: </b> The <i>tanna</i> of the Mishnah could have said that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of R' Yehuda. He preferred to ascribe this opinion to R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <b>since the verse opened first with</b> the phrase cited by R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov as the source for the requirement of waving the first fruits, as R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” (Deuteronomy 26:4); whereas R' Yehuda derives it from the later verse: “And you shall place it before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: </b> The <i>tanna</i> preferred to cite this <i>halakha</i> in the name of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>since his strength</b> in Torah <b>is great, </b> as the <i>halakha</i> is invariably in accordance with his opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | and set it down | Sukkah 47b:6 | R' Yehuda holds that first fruits require waving, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> that it is stated with regard to first fruits: <b>“And you shall set it down</b> before YHWH your God,” (Deuteronomy 26:10), and <b>this is</b> referring to <b>waving</b> before the altar the basket containing the first fruits. Do <b>you say</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps it is referring <b>only to actually setting it down</b> adjacent to the altar? <b>When</b> the Torah <b>says: </b> “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand <b>and set it down</b> before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>setting it down is already stated. How, </b> then, <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall set it down”? This is</b> referring to <b>waving. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand” | Sukkah 47b:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> that requires one to stay overnight when bringing first fruits to Jerusalem is not in accordance with R' Yehuda’s opinion. Rather, <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </b> who also holds that first fruits require waving. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4), which <b>taught concerning first fruits that they require waving. </b> This is the <b>statement of R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:4 | that they require placement | Temurah 21a:16 | But this comparison is also flawed, as <b>what</b> is unique <b>about first fruits? </b> They are unique in <b>that they require placement</b> before the altar, as it is stated: “And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4). Perhaps it is for this reason that they must be eaten in the presence of the Temple. <b>Shall you say</b> that this is also the case with regard <b>to</b> second <b>tithe, which is not</b> obligated in placement before the altar? |
| Deuteronomy 26:5 | in that they require reciting | Chullin 120b:8 | But this derivation from the case of first fruits <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about first fruits? </b> They are notable <b>in that they require reciting</b> the passage which begins: “My father was a wandering Aramean” (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and placing</b> the fruits in the Temple, whereas no such requirements exists with regard to consecrated produce. |
| Deuteronomy 26:5 | “An Aramean tried to destroy my father” | Pesachim 116a:7 | <b>And according to the intelligence</b> and the ability <b>of</b> the <b>son, his father teaches him</b> about the Exodus. When teaching his son about the Exodus. <b>He begins with</b> the Jewish people’s <b>disgrace and concludes with</b> their <b>glory. And he expounds from</b> the passage: <b>“An Aramean tried to destroy my father”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), the declaration one recites when presenting his first fruits at the Temple, <b>until he concludes</b> explaining <b>the entire section. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:5 | “And you shall speak and say before the Lord your God” | Sotah 32a:7 | <b>How</b> is it derived that the <b>recitation</b> when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> is recited specifically in Hebrew? When the Torah discusses this mitzva it states: <b>“And you shall speak and say before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and below, </b> in the discussion of the blessings and curses, <b>it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the Levites speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:5 | from the recitation of the first fruits, | Sotah 32b:10 | That one should say <b>his praise in a soft voice</b> is derived <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the declaration of tithes, </b> where one declares that he has acted appropriately, and the verse does not state: And you shall speak. That one should say that which is to <b>his discredit in a loud voice</b> is derived <b>from the recitation of the first fruits, </b> concerning which the verse states: “And you shall speak and say” (Deuteronomy 26:5), i.e., it should be recited loudly. The portion recited when bringing the first fruits details the hardships that the Jewish people suffered and denigrates Laban the Aramean, who is a progenitor of the Jewish people. |
| Deuteronomy 26:5 | “And you shall speak and say before the Lord your God” | Sotah 33a:13 | § It is stated in the Mishnah: <b>And these are recited</b> only <b>in the sacred tongue: The recitation of</b> the verses that one recounts when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple; <b>and <i>ḥalitza</i>… How</b> is it derived that the <b>recitation</b> when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> is recited specifically in Hebrew? When the Torah discusses this mitzva it states: <b>“And you shall speak and say before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and below, </b> in the discussion of the blessings and curses, <b>it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say to all the men of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> in the portion of the Levites, they speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> in the portion of the first fruits, the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:7 | Egypt, as it is written: “And He saw our affliction” | Yoma 74b:13 | The Talmud continues to challenge the view of R' Yishmael: <b>And let us derive</b> it <b>from affliction</b> stated with regard to <b>Egypt, as it is written: “And He saw our affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:7). <b>We say that</b> this verse is referring to <b>abstinence from sex. </b> The Egyptians prevented the Jewish people from having sex. This affliction is an example of public affliction that is not abstention from eating or drinking. <b>Rather, </b> the prohibition to eat or drink on Yom Kippur should not be learned as stated previously, but as follows: <b>We derive affliction by the hand of God from affliction by the hand of God, </b> i.e., affliction caused directly by God or through His mitzvot; <b>and we do not derive affliction by the hand of God from affliction by the hand of man. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | and recites | Bava Batra136b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>engage in a dispute</b> concerning <b>this</b> issue <b>one time? As it was stated: </b> With regard to <b>one who sells his field for</b> just its <b>produce, </b> meaning that he retains ownership over the field itself and he sells the rights to all of its produce to someone else, <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> The purchaser <b>brings</b> first fruits from this field to the Temple <b>and recites</b> the verses in the Torah associated with the bringing of the first fruits, in which he thanks God for: “The land that You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>And Reish Lakish says: </b> The purchaser <b>brings</b> the first fruits, <b>but he does not recite</b> the verses, since it is not his field. |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | but does not recite | Bava Batra81a:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>We learned</b> in a Mishnah <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passages of thanks to God that appear in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:1–11), as the land does not belong to him and therefore he cannot state: “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>R' Meir says: He brings</b> the first fruits <b>and</b> also <b>recites</b> the passage. |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | have given me” | Bava Batra81a:8 | The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it written: </b> “The choicest first fruits of <b>your land</b> you shall bring” (Exodus 23:19)? The Talmud answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> fruit bought by a Jew that was grown on the <b>land of a non-Jew</b> in Eretz Yisrael. The Talmud asks: <b>But isn’t it written: </b> “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, <b>which You, </b> Lord, <b>have given me”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:10)? If he purchased the fruit, then the land on which it grew was not given to him by God. The Talmud answers that the phrase “which You have given me” can mean <b>that You have given me money, and with that</b> money <b>I bought</b> this fruit. |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | and recites | Gittin 47b:7 | § <b>It was stated: </b> With regard to <b>one who sells his field for</b> just its <b>produce, </b> meaning that he retains ownership over the field itself and he sells the rights to all of its produce to someone else, <b>R' Yoḥanan says: </b> The purchaser <b>brings</b> first fruits from this field to the Temple <b>and recites</b> the verses in the Torah associated with the bringing of the first fruits, in which he thanks God for: “The land which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Reish Lakish says: </b> Although the buyer <b>brings</b> the first fruits, <b>he does not recite</b> the verses, since it is not his field. |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | acquisition of the item itself. | Gittin 48a:2 | The Talmud explains: <b>R' Yoḥanan says</b> that the purchaser <b>brings</b> the first fruits <b>and recites</b> the verses, because he holds that the <b>acquisition of</b> an item for <b>its produce is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>acquisition of the item itself. </b> Consequently, the one bringing the fruits can truthfully recite: “The land which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that the purchaser <b>brings</b> the first fruits <b>but</b> he <b>does not recite</b> the verses, because he holds that the <b>acquisition of</b> an item for <b>its produce is not considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>acquisition of the item itself. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | “And you shall place it | Makkot 18b:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the statement of <b>R' Yehuda? </b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse written in the portion of first fruits: <b>“And you shall place it</b> before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10), that the reference is not to the placement of the fruits alongside the altar; rather, <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving</b> the first fruits. <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> a reference <b>only</b> to <b>actual placement</b> of the first fruits? He explains: <b>When it states</b> earlier: “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand <b>and place it</b> before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>placement</b> alongside the altar <b>is</b> already <b>stated; how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“And you shall place it”? This</b> is a reference to <b>waving. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | “And you shall place it | Menachot 61b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let</b> the Mishnah <b>also say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that first fruits require waving is <b>in accordance with the statement of R' Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse written in the portion of first fruits: <b>“And you shall place it</b> before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:10), the reference is not to the placement of the fruits alongside the altar. Rather, <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving</b> the first fruits. <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> a reference <b>only</b> to <b>actual placement</b> of the first fruits? |
| Deuteronomy 26:10 | “And you shall set it down | Sukkah 47b:6 | R' Yehuda holds that first fruits require waving, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yehuda says</b> that it is stated with regard to first fruits: <b>“And you shall set it down</b> before YHWH your God,” (Deuteronomy 26:10), and <b>this is</b> referring to <b>waving</b> before the altar the basket containing the first fruits. Do <b>you say</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to <b>waving, or</b> perhaps it is referring <b>only to actually setting it down</b> adjacent to the altar? <b>When</b> the Torah <b>says: </b> “And the priest shall take the basket from your hand <b>and set it down</b> before the altar of YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>setting it down is already stated. How, </b> then, <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall set it down”? This is</b> referring to <b>waving. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:11 | “And you shall rejoice in all the goodness | Arakhin 11a:12 | The Talmud objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that the joyful service of God referred to above is the bringing of the <b>first fruits, as it is written</b> in that context: <b>“And you shall rejoice in all the goodness</b> that YHWH your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 26:11). The Talmud answers: Bringing the first fruits <b>is</b> indeed <b>called goodness, </b> but <b>it is not called</b> something that involves <b>goodness of heart. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:11 | and to your house” | Gittin 47b:9 | <b>R' Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> concerning the bringing of first fruits, as the verse states: “And you shall rejoice in all of the good that YHWH your God has given to you <b>and to your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:11). The phrase “your house” often refers to a wife. Therefore, the rabbis said: This <b>teaches that a man brings his wife’s first fruits, and he recites</b> the relevant verses. This is true despite the fact that a husband acquires the field of his wife only for the produce. It seems from this <i>baraita</i> that the acquisition of a field’s produce is considered to be like the acquisition of the field itself. |
| Deuteronomy 26:11 | as it is written: “And you shall rejoice in all the good | Pesachim 36b:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R' Shimon, although he does not</b> accept this <b>juxtaposition</b> of first fruits and second tithe, <b>in any case</b> the word <b>joy is written with regard to</b> first fruits, <b>as it is written: “And you shall rejoice in all the good</b> that YHWH has given you and your household” (Deuteronomy 26:11). In light of this, how can R' Shimon permit an acute mourner to eat first fruits? |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | giving is written | Bava Metzia11b:6 | The Talmud rejects Rava’s reasoning: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. With regard to gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled, and similarly with regard to tithes that are given to Levites and to the poor, the concept of <b>giving is written</b> in the Torah: “And have given it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12). These gifts must be given and not sold or bartered. Therefore, since <b>exchange is a form of buying and selling, </b> it is an inappropriate mode of acquisition with regard to tithes. By contrast, transferring ownership of <b>movable property by means of</b> transferring ownership of <b>land is a powerful</b> form of <b>giving. </b> Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could not give them the tithes by means of a symbolic exchange using a cloth, but instead had to give it to them along with land. Therefore, since the transaction was not effected by means of a courtyard, it poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied” | Bava Metzia88a:2 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says: Even</b> bringing produce into the <b>courtyard determines</b> that the production process of the produce has been completed and that the produce is therefore subject to tithes, <b>as it is stated</b> in the confession of the tithes: “And I have given to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, <b>and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied” | Berakhot 35b:12 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan said: Even</b> bringing it into the <b>courtyard determines</b> its status as having completed the production process and obligates the produce to be tithed, <b>as it is written</b> in the confession of the tithes: “And I have given to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan and the widow, <b>and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | giving is written with regard to it, | Chullin 131b:5 | <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches with regard to the <b>poor man’s tithe that is distributed</b> from <b>within his house</b> that <b>the owner has the benefit of discretion. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is because the requirement of <b>giving is written with regard to it, </b> as the verse states: “When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the 3rd year, which is the year of tithing, and you shall give it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 26:12). Consequently, in this case it is not left for the poor but is actively given to them. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | as it is stated: “That they may eat within your gates, and be satisfied” | Gittin 81a:15 | <b>And R' Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to this issue: <b>Even</b> entry into the <b>courtyard establishes</b> an obligation to tithe, <b>as it is stated: “That they may eat within your gates, and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). This indicates that once the produce is brought into the courtyard, it is obligated in tithes. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | and they shall eat within your gates and be satisfied” | Makkot 16b:15 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: It is derived as <b>the verse states: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain or of your wine or of your oil” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and there it states: </b> “And you shall give to the Levite, to the convert, to the orphan, and to the widow, <b>and they shall eat within your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). <b>Just as there, </b> with regard to the phrase “and they shall eat within your gates,” it is referring to <b>poor man’s tithe, here too, </b> “you may not eat within your gates” is referring to produce in which there is <b>poor man’s tithe, </b> as it has not yet been separated, <b>and God states</b> a prohibition: <b>You may not</b> eat it. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | “And you shall give to the Levite, to the stranger, | Nedarim 84b:5 | <b>Rava says</b> that it is possible to explain the apparent contradiction between the sources with regard to benefit from poor man’s tithe without recourse to a tannaitic dispute: <b>Here, </b> the Mishnah is referring <b>to poor man’s tithe distributed in the</b> owner’s <b>house, </b> i.e., poor man’s tithe that had not been distributed in the threshing floor but was brought home and must now be distributed to the poor who visit the house, <b>as</b> the term <b>giving is written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> such a tithe: <b>“And you shall give to the Levite, to the stranger, </b> to the orphan, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12), and the owner is entitled to give the tithe to the poor man of his choice, as the benefit of discretion is conferred upon him. <b>Due to that</b> reason, it <b>is prohibited</b> for one who vowed not to derive benefit from people <b>to derive benefit</b> from this type of poor man’s tithe. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | “When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your produce in the third year, which is the year of the tithe” | Rosh Hashanah12b:2 | <b>From where are these matters</b> derived that during the 3rd year one must set aside poor man’s tithe and not second tithe? <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: </b> The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your produce in the 3rd year, which is the year of the tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). This is referring to <b>a year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so? </b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe, </b> which is explicitly mentioned in that section, <b>and second tithe is nullified</b> that year. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | and have given | Temurah 10a:9 | R' Yoḥanan’s statement continues: And if one <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from his</b> produce <b>to</b> exempt the produce <b>of others, </b> so that the other’s produce will be permitted in consumption, the <b>benefit of discretion is his. </b> He is entitled to determine which priest receives the <i>teruma</i>. The Talmud explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: </b> “When you have made an end of tithing <b>all the tithe of your produce</b> in the 3rd year, which is the year of tithing, <b>and have given</b> it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12). This indicates that the one actually giving the produce chooses to whom to give it. |
| Deuteronomy 26:12 | it states: “That they may eat within your gates and be satisfied” | Yevamot 86a:5 | <b>The verse states: “You may not eat within your gates</b> the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17), <b>and below, </b> with regard to the poor man’s tithe, <b>it states: “That they may eat within your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). <b>Just as “your gates” stated below</b> is referring to <b>the poor man’s tithe, so too “your gates” stated here</b> is referring to <b>the poor man’s tithe, and God states</b> in the Torah <b>“you may not</b> eat,” implying that it may be eaten only after separation. |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I have removed the consecrated from the house” | Bava Metzia88a:1 | <b>until it sees the front of the house</b> through which people enter and exit, and it is brought into the house through that entrance, <b>as it is stated</b> in the formula of the declaration of the tithes: <b>“I have removed the consecrated from the house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13), which indicates that the obligation to tithe produce whose purpose has not yet been designated applies only when it is brought into the house. |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I have removed the consecrated from the house” | Berakhot 35b:11 | Along these lines, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said in the name of R' Yehuda ben El’ai: Come and see that the latter generations are not like the earlier generations. </b> In the <b>earlier generations, </b> people <b>would bring their fruits into their courtyards through the main gate in order to obligate them in tithes. </b> However, <b>the latter generations bring their fruits through roofs, through courtyards and through enclosed courtyards, </b> avoiding the main gate <b>in order to exempt them from</b> the mitzva of <b>tithing. As R' Yannai said: Untithed produce is not obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>tithing until it sees the front of the house</b> through which people enter and exit, and it is brought into the house that way <b>as it is stated</b> in the formula of the confession of the tithes: <b>“I have removed the consecrated from the house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13), as the obligation to tithe produce whose purpose has not yet been designated takes effect only when it is brought into the house. |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget” | Berakhot 40b:10 | The Talmud considers <b>the matter</b> of Rav’s opinion <b>itself</b> and cites the fundamental dispute in that regard. <b>Rav said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of God’s name is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. And R' Yoḥanan said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of</b> God’s <b>sovereignty is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: In the confession of the tithes, one recites, <b>“I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13). The meaning of phrase, <b>I did not transgress, </b> is that I did not refrain <b>from blessing You</b> when separating tithes; and the meaning of the phrase, <b>and I did not forget, </b> is that I did not forget <b>to mention Your name in</b> the blessing recited <b>over it. However, this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>did not teach</b> that one must mention God’s <b>sovereignty</b> in the blessing. |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | “I have put away the hallowed things out of my house” | Gittin 81a:14 | The Talmud explains: <b>As R' Yannai says: Untithed produce does not become obligated in tithes until it sees the entrance of the house, </b> through which people enter and exit, <b>as it is stated</b> in the declaration of the tithes: <b>“I have put away the hallowed things out of my house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13). As long as untithed produce is not taken into the house through the primary entrance of the house, it is permitted to eat it casually without tithing it. Consequently, they would take the produce in through another entrance in order to exempt it from tithes. |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | As it is written: “Then you shall say before the Lord your God: I have put away the hallowed things out of my house” | Sotah 32b:6 | <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>the declaration of tithes</b> may be recited in any language? <b>As it is written: “Then you shall say before YHWH your God: I have put away the hallowed things out of my house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13). <b>And derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <b>saying</b> mentioned in this verse, and the saying mentioned in the verse with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> (Numbers 5:21), that one is permitted to recite the declaration of tithes <b>in any language that he speaks. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:13 | with | Sotah 48a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>And let him</b> at least <b>declare</b> that he donated <b>the other tithes</b> in the proper manner. <b>Reish Lakish said: Any house that does not state the declaration about</b> the <b>first tithe can no longer state the declaration of the other</b> types of <b>tithes. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Abaye said: Because the written</b> verse <b>began</b> the declaration <b>with</b> the tithe given to the Levites: “And I also gave it to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow, in accordance with all Your mitzvot that You commanded me” (Deuteronomy 26:13). If he cannot say the first part of the declaration, he cannot say the rest. |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | “I have not put any of it away when impure” | Makkot 19b:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that one is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>due to impurity? </b> It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon says</b> that the verse in the portion of the declaration of tithes: <b>“I have not put any of it away when impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), is a general formulation that is interpreted to mean: <b>Whether I am impure and</b> the second-tithe produce <b>is ritually pure, </b> or <b>whether I am ritually pure and</b> the second-tithe produce <b>is impure. </b> R' Shimon adds: <b>And I do not know where</b> it is that <b>one is warned, </b> i.e., where is there a prohibition, <b>with regard to eating. </b> Although it is clear from the verse cited that it is prohibited for one to partake of second-tithe produce while impure, the source for this prohibition is unclear. |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | neither have I removed it while impure” | Pesachim 24a:11 | <b>If it does not</b> refer to the subject <b>matter itself, as that</b> can be <b>derived by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the second <b>tithe, </b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>which</b> are more <b>lenient</b> than those of offerings, then it must refer to something else. As it is possible to say: <b>If</b> with regard to the second <b>tithe, which is</b> more <b>lenient</b> because it does not have the status of an offering, <b>the Torah said</b> that when one recites the confession over the tithes, when destroying the tithes remaining in one’s possession that had not yet been given to the appropriate recipient, he says: “I have not eaten from it in my mourning, <b>neither have I removed it while impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), indicating that it is prohibited for one to remove tithes while impure, then with regard to <b>consecrated meat, </b> which is more <b>stringent, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that it may not be eaten while a person is impure? |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | of joy, | Pesachim 36a:4 | <b>A baraita states: </b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person can fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <b><i>matza</i></b> on Passover <b>with</b> <i>matza</i> of <b>second tithe in Jerusalem. </b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b> “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, <b>the bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <i>oni</i> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, i.e., poor man’s bread. As this is similar to the phrase: Bread of acute mourning [<i>leḥem oni</i>], <i>oni</i> with an <i>alef</i>, it can be inferred that this mitzva must be fulfilled with <i>matza</i> <b>that</b> can <b>be eaten</b> during a period of <b>acute mourning, </b> on the day one’s close relative has died. This <b>excludes this</b> second tithe, <b>which cannot be eaten during</b> a period of <b>acute mourning but only</b> in a state <b>of joy, </b> as the Torah states: “I have not eaten from it in my acute mourning” (Deuteronomy 26:14). This is <b>the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | neither have I destroyed from it while impure” | Shabbat 25a:3 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead an alternative manner to derive this <i>halakha</i>, from the statement of <b>R' Abbahu, as R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> It is written in the confession of the tithes: <b>“</b>I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, <b>neither have I destroyed from it while impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14). By inference: <b>From it you may not destroy, but you may destroy the oil of <i>teruma</i> that has become ritually impure. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> differently: <b>From it you may not destroy, but you may destroy</b> and derive benefit from burning <b>consecrated oil that became ritually impure. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | to the priests. | Sotah 48a:1 | <b>and we give</b> it <b>to the priests. </b> Ezra penalized the Levites for not ascending with him from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael by taking away their right to the first tithe. Consequently, the owner of the produce can no longer recite the declaration of tithes, which includes the statement: “I have done according to all that You have commanded me” (Deuteronomy 26:14), as he did not give the tithe to the Levites. |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | “I did not consume of it while impure” | Yevamot 73b:5 | It was stated above that <b>it is prohibited to burn</b> second tithe and first fruits even when they are <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, and</b> that <b>one who eats them when they themselves, </b> the second tithe and first fruits, <b>are ritually impure is flogged, </b> even though he himself is ritually pure. <b>From where do we</b> derive these <i>halakhot</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon says: </b> The verse with regard to the confession of tithes states: <b>“I did not consume of it while impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), a general statement that means <b>whether I, </b> the one who ate it, was <b>ritually impure, and</b> the tithe <b>was ritually pure, </b> or <b>whether I was ritually pure and</b> the tithe <b>was ritually impure. </b> Regardless, the tithe may not be consumed through burning or eating in a state of impurity. |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | states: “I did not consume of it while impure” | Yevamot 73b:8 | It was stated above that one is prohibited from burning second tithe and first fruits even when they are ritually impure, <b>which is not</b> the case <b>with</b> regard to <b><i>teruma</i>. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> does not apply to <i>teruma</i>? <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: As the verse</b> with regard to the declaration of tithes <b>states: “I did not consume of it while impure”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), and the words “of it” teach that <b>of it, </b> i.e., tithe, <b>you may not burn</b> when it is impure, <b>but you may burn</b> and derive benefit from <b>the oil of <i>teruma</i> that has become ritually impure. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | of it | Yevamot 74a:10 | The Talmud further comments on this issue. <b>And R' Yitzḥak, too, maintains</b> that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man is <b>prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe, as R' Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe? It is stated: </b> “And I did not consume <b>of it</b> while impure” (Deuteronomy 26:14) <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, and it is stated: </b> “Do not eat <b>of it</b> raw” (Exodus 12:9) <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb. Just as</b> in the case of <b>the Paschal lamb, </b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it, so too, </b> in the case of second <b>tithe, </b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | tithe: | Yevamot 74a:14 | Similarly, <b>“of it” is written three</b> times <b>with</b> regard to second <b>tithe: </b> “I did not eat of it in my mourning, and I did not consume of it while impure, and I did not give of it for the dead” (Deuteronomy 26:14). The three instances of “of it” are expounded as follows: <b>One for itself; and one for</b> that which <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> said, that the verse comes to permit a priest to burn impure <i>teruma</i> oil and derive benefit from its light; <b>and one for</b> the following teaching of <b>Reish Lakish. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 26:14 | lenient, the Torah stated: “I have not eaten thereof in my mourning [ ve’oni ]” | Zevachim 101a:11 | <b>As, if</b> you claim that it also applies <b>to the offerings of</b> all <b>generations, </b> then one can prove this is not so via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the second <b>tithe, </b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient</b> than for sacrificial meat: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the second <b>tithe, </b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient, the Torah stated: “I have not eaten thereof in my mourning [<i>ve’oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), teaching that an acute mourner [<i>onen</i>] is prohibited from partaking of it, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that <b>with regard to the offerings of</b> all <b>generations, </b> an acute mourner is prohibited from partaking of them? |
| Deuteronomy 26:15 | is called heaven? As it is stated: “Look forth from Your holy Ma’on , from heaven” | Chagigah 12b:9 | With regard to the same matter, <b>R' Levi said: Anyone who pauses from words of Torah to occupy himself with mundane conversation will be fed with the coals of the broom tree, as it is stated: “They pluck saltwort [<i>maluaḥ</i>] with wormwood [<i>alei siaḥ</i>], and the roots of the broom tree [<i>retamim</i>] are their food”</b> (Job 30:4). The exposition is as follows: Those who pluck, i.e., pause, from learning Torah, which was given upon two tablets, <i>luḥot</i>, which sounds similar to <i>maluaḥ</i>, for the purpose of <i>siaḥ</i>, idle chatter, are punished by having to eat coals made from “the roots of the broom tree. ” <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> <i>Ma’on</i> <b>is called heaven? As it is stated: “Look forth from Your holy <i>Ma’on</i>, from heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:15). |
| Deuteronomy 26:15 | “Look forth from your holy habitation, from heaven, | Sotah 39b:1 | <b>as You have promised us, </b> namely: “So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them” (Numbers 6:27). <b>“Look forth from your holy habitation, from heaven, </b> and bless Your people, Israel” (Deuteronomy 26:15). |
| Deuteronomy 26:16 | “This day the Lord your God has commanded you | Megillah 20b:14 | <b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for the declaration with regard to tithes, as it is written</b> in the formula of this declaration: <b>“And you shall say before YHWH your God, I have removed the sacred things out of my house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13–15); <b>and juxtaposed to</b> that passage it is written: <b>“This day YHWH your God has commanded you</b> to do” (Deuteronomy 26:16), implying during the day and not at night. |
| Deuteronomy 26:19 | “And to elevate you | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation, </b> to whom God is close, like YHWH our God whenever we call upon Him? ” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation, </b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today? ” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel, </b> who is like you? A people saved by YHWH, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to YHWH, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 27:3 | and writing is stated there, | Menachot 34a:12 | The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go [<i>kalekh</i>] this way, </b> i.e., one can suggest a different interpretation: An expression of <b>writing is stated here, </b> with regard to a <i>mezuza</i>, <b>and writing is stated there, </b> with regard to the mitzva of writing the words of the Torah on stones upon the entry to Eretz Yisrael (Deuteronomy 27:3). <b>Just as there, </b> the words are written <b>on the stones</b> themselves, <b>so too here, </b> the <i>mezuza</i> should be written <b>on the stones. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:4 | “And it shall be when you have gone over the Jordan, that you shall set up | Sanhedrin 44a:16 | § With regard to the verse that states: <b>“And YHWH said to Joshua: Get you up; </b> why do you lie this way on your face? ” (Joshua 7:10), <b>R' Sheila taught</b> in a public lecture: <b>God said to</b> Joshua: <b>Your</b> own sin <b>is</b> even <b>worse than</b> that of the other Jews who sinned, as <b>I said</b> to the Jewish people: <b>“And it shall be when you have gone over the Jordan, that you shall set up</b> these stones” (Deuteronomy 27:4), <b>and you have</b> already <b>distanced yourselves sixty <i>mil</i></b> from the Jordan River, and you have yet to fulfill the mitzva. |
| Deuteronomy 27:4 | beyond the Jordan, isn’t it written: “And it shall be when you have passed over the Jordan, | Sotah 33b:7 | <b>R' Elazar</b> disagrees with R' Yehuda and <b>says: “Are they not beyond the Jordan”</b> means <b>near the Jordan</b> River, <b>as, if</b> it meant <b>farther</b> west <b>beyond the Jordan, isn’t it written: “And it shall be when you have passed over the Jordan, </b> that you shall set up these stones which I command you this day, on Mount Ebal” (Deuteronomy 27:4)? This implies that Mount Ebal was near the location where the Jewish people crossed the Jordan. |
| Deuteronomy 27:5 | “You shall lift up no iron tool upon them” | Avodah Zarah52b:10 | The Talmud explains why the altar’s stones were sequestered: The Hasmoneans <b>said: What should we do</b> to revoke the stone’s forbidden status? <b>Shall we break them? </b> That is not possible, as <b>God states</b> in the Torah: “You shall build the altar of YHWH your God of <b>unhewn stones”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:6). <b>Shall we saw them</b> without breaking them? That is also not a viable option, as <b>God states</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall lift up no iron tool upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:5). There was therefore no alternative to sequestering the stones. |
| Deuteronomy 27:5 | stones | Zevachim 61b:4 | § The Talmud raises another discussion concerning the altar: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: The altar in Shiloh was</b> fashioned <b>of stones, </b> unlike the portable altar constructed in the time of Moses, which was fashioned from copper.

| Deuteronomy 27:7 | and you shall eat there” | Chagigah 4b:7 | <b>Similarly, when Rav Huna reached this verse, he cried: “And you shall sacrifice peace</b>-offerings, <b>and you shall eat there”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). Can it happen to <b>a slave whose master expects</b> him <b>to eat at his table, </b> that his master <b>will</b> eventually <b>distance himself from him? As it is written: “To what purpose is the multitude of your offerings to Me? says YHWH”</b> (Isaiah 1:11). |
| Deuteronomy 27:7 | not valid, as it is stated: “And you shall slaughter…and you shall eat” | Chullin 31a:12 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> If <b>a knife fell and slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>although</b> the knife <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in the standard manner, </b> the slaughter is <b>not valid, as it is stated: “And you shall slaughter…and you shall eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7), from which it is derived: <b>That which you slaughter you may eat, </b> and that which was slaughtered on its own, you may not eat. |
| Deuteronomy 27:7 | tithe. | Menachot 82a:1 | <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a peace offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money is derived by a verbal analogy between <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there” from</b> the verse discussing second <b>tithe. </b> The verse states with regard to a peace offering: “And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and you shall eat there” (Deuteronomy 27:7), and the verse states with regard to second tithe: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 14:23). <b>And from this</b> it may be concluded: <b>Just as peace offerings are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe, </b> as they are not produce, <b>so too</b> with regard to the loaves of <b>a thanks offering, they are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe. And that wheat which is purchased with second-tithe money is also not itself</b> second <b>tithe; </b> it may therefore be used for the loaves of the thanks offering. |
| Deuteronomy 27:7 | meat, as it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings and you shall eat there and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God” | Pesachim 109a:5 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda ben Beteira says: When the Temple is standing, rejoicing is only through</b> the eating of sacrificial <b>meat, as it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings and you shall eat there and you shall rejoice before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). <b>And now that the Temple is not standing</b> and one cannot eat sacrificial meat, he can fulfill the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival <b>only by</b> drinking <b>wine, as it is stated: “And wine that gladdens the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). |
| Deuteronomy 27:7 | and you shall rejoice | Pesachim 70b:12 | <b>Ulla said that R' Elazar said: </b> With regard to <b>peace-offerings that one slaughtered on the eve of the Festival, one fulfills with them neither</b> the mitzva to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing nor</b> the mitzva to bring a <b>Festival peace-offering. </b> The mitzva of bringing peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing</b> is not fulfilled, <b>as it is written: “And you shall slaughter</b> peace-offerings and eat there, <b>and you shall rejoice</b> before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 27:7). Based on this verse, <b>we require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> be |
| Deuteronomy 27:7 | there” | Zevachim 50a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the money to purchase <b>peace offerings themselves</b> can come from money used to redeem the second tithe? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to peace offerings: “And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and shall eat <b>there”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7). And it is written with regard to second tithe: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God, in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell <b>there”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). The usage of the term “there” in both passages serves as a verbal analogy, and demonstrates that a <i>halakha</i> derived via a verbal analogy, that of a peace offering, can then teach a <i>halakha</i> via its juxtaposition to a thanks offering. |

| Deuteronomy 27:8 | “And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law | Sotah 35b:6 | § The Talmud returns to the discussion of how the Ark was brought into Eretz Yisrael. <b>You are found saying</b> that <b>there were three sets of stones. One</b> is a set <b>that Moses erected in the land of Moab, as it is stated: “Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses took upon himself to expound [<i>be’er</i>]</b> this law, saying” (Deuteronomy 1:5). <b>And it states there</b> with regard to the mitzva to erect the stones on Mount Ebal: <b>“And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law</b> clearly elucidated [<i>ba’er</i>]” (Deuteronomy 27:8). <b>It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>be’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to Moses, and the word <b>“<i>ba’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to the mitzva to write the Torah on the stones on Mount Ebal that Moses also wrote down the Torah on stones. |
| Deuteronomy 27:8 | The Sages taught: How did the Jewish people write the Torah? Rabbi Yehuda says: They wrote it on stones, as it is stated: “And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law” | Sotah 35b:8 | <b>A baraita states: How did the Jewish people write the Torah?

| Deuteronomy 27:8 | clearly elucidated” | Sotah 36a:5 | The Talmud continues its description of the entrance into Eretz Yisrael during the period of Joshua: <b>And afterward they brought the stones and built the altar</b> on Mount Ebal, <b>and plastered it</b> over <b>with plaster, and wrote on</b> the stones <b>all of the words of the Torah in seventy languages, as it is stated: </b> “And you shall write on the stones all of the words of this law <b>clearly elucidated”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:8). |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | as it is written: “Pay attention, and hear, Israel” | Berakhot 15b:15 | <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> The <b>dispute</b> as to whether or not a deaf person fulfills his obligation <b>is</b> only <b>in</b> the case of <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but with regard to the rest of the mitzvot, everyone agrees that he does not fulfill</b> his obligation if he does not hear his recitation, <b>as it is written: “Pay attention, and hear, Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:9); meaning that one is required to listen and hear. |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | it says: “Pay attention, and hear [ shema ], Israel” | Berakhot 16a:10 | <b>Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, raised a contradiction before Rava: We learned</b> in our Mishnah: <b>Laborers may recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>atop the tree or atop the course of stones</b> in a wall under construction. <b>We see that he does not require intent, </b> simple recitation is sufficient. <b>And he raised a contradiction</b> from the verbal analogy taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> must focus his heart, as it is stated: “Hear [<i>Shema</i>], Israel. ” And below, </b> later in Deuteronomy, <b>it says: “Pay attention, and hear [<i>shema</i>], Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:9). <b>Just as there</b> one must <b>pay attention, so too here</b> one must <b>pay attention. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:9 | “Keep silence [ hasket ] and hear, Israel; this day you have become a people | Berakhot 63b:10 | <b>And R' Yehuda again began</b> to speak <b>in honor of Torah and taught: </b> When Moses took leave of Israel on his last day in this world, he said: <b>“Keep silence [<i>hasket</i>] and hear, Israel; this day you have become a people</b> unto YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 27:9). This is surprising: <b>Was the Torah given to Israel on that day? Wasn’t that day at the end of forty years</b> since the Torah was given? <b>Rather, </b> it comes <b>to teach that each and every day the Torah is as dear to those who study it, as</b> it was <b>on the day it was given from Mount Sinai. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:12 | above, | Sotah 37a:7 | § The Talmud returns to discussing the blessing and curses. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:9) that <b>R' Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: It is impossible to say</b> that the tribe of <b>Levi</b> stood <b>below, </b> between the two mountains, <b>as it is already stated</b> that they were <b>above, </b> in the verse: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon and Levi and Judah” (Deuteronomy 27:12). <b>And it is impossible to say</b> that they stood <b>above</b> on the mountain <b>because it is already stated: </b> “And all of Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the Ark and on that side before the priests the Levites” (Joshua 8:33). This shows that the Levites stood <b>below, </b> between the mountains, with the Ark. |
| Deuteronomy 27:12 | on [ al ] | Sotah 37a:9 | <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Both</b> the Levites <b>and</b> the Israelites <b>were standing below. They turned to face Mount Gerizim and opened with a blessing, </b> and then they turned <b>toward Mount Ebal and opened with a curse. </b> Therefore, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the verse: “These shall stand <b>on [<i>al</i>]</b> Mount Gerizim to bless the people” (Deuteronomy 27:12)? <b>“<i>Al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to</b> the mountain but not actually on the mountain itself. |
| Deuteronomy 27:12 | on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, it is already stated: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people” | Sotah 37b:10 | <b>A baraita states: “And you shall give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse</b> on Mount Ebal” (Deuteronomy 11:29). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the blessing must be</b> given <b>on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, it is already stated: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:12), <b>and it is written: “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13). <b>Rather, </b> the verse teaches that the proclamation of the <b>blessing must precede</b> the <b>curse. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:12 | to bless the people” | Sotah 38a:2 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states: </b> The mitzva given to the priests: <b>“So you shall bless</b> the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:23), is that they bless them <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> Hebrew. Do <b>you say</b> that the benediction must be recited <b>in the sacred tongue, or</b> perhaps it may be recited <b>in any language? </b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here, </b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction: <b>“So you shall bless, ” and it is stated there, </b> with regard to the blessings and curses: <b>“These shall stand</b> on Mount Gerizim <b>to bless the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:12). There is a verbal analogy between these two usages of the word “bless”: <b>Just as there, </b> the blessings and curses were recited <b>in the sacred tongue, </b> as stated above (33a), <b>so too here, </b> the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:13 | “And these shall stand for the curse” | Shevuot 36a:5 | There is an element of <b>curse within it, as it is written</b> with regard to the ceremony at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal: <b>“And these shall stand for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13), <b>and it is written: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] be the man who fashions a graven image, </b> an abomination to YHWH, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen” (Deuteronomy 27:15). |
| Deuteronomy 27:13 | and it is written: “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse” | Sotah 37b:10 | <b>A baraita states: “And you shall give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse</b> on Mount Ebal” (Deuteronomy 11:29). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the blessing must be</b> given <b>on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, it is already stated: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:12), <b>and it is written: “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13). <b>Rather, </b> the verse teaches that the proclamation of the <b>blessing must precede</b> the <b>curse. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say” | Sotah 32a:7 | <b>How</b> is it derived that the <b>recitation</b> when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> is recited specifically in Hebrew? When the Torah discusses this mitzva it states: <b>“And you shall speak and say before YHWH your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and below, </b> in the discussion of the blessings and curses, <b>it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the Levites speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | and below it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say” | Sotah 32a:8 | <b>How</b> is it derived that the recitation at <b>a <i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony must be in Hebrew? The verse in the Torah portion discussing <i>ḥalitza</i> states: <b>“And she shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>and below it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the Levites speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | Levites | Sotah 32b:7 | <b>Rav Zevid said to Abaye: But let us derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <b>saying</b> mentioned in the verse: “And the <b>Levites</b> shall speak and say” (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there, </b> the Levites recited the blessings and curses <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> one must recite the declaration of tithes <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say to all the men of Israel” | Sotah 33a:13 | § It is stated in the Mishnah: <b>And these are recited</b> only <b>in the sacred tongue: The recitation of</b> the verses that one recounts when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple; <b>and <i>ḥalitza</i>… How</b> is it derived that the <b>recitation</b> when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> is recited specifically in Hebrew?

| Deuteronomy 27:14 | Moses. It is written here: “With a loud voice” | Sotah 33a:14 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Levites themselves</b> answered in Hebrew? The Talmud answers: It is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“voice”</b> that appears here, in the portion of the blessings and curses, and the word <b>“voice”</b> in the verse that relates to <b>Moses. It is written here: “With a loud voice”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14), <b>and it is written there: “Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). <b>Just as there, </b> the Ten Commandments were stated <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here, </b> the Levites spoke <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | “voice” | Sotah 33b:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>But let</b> R' Yehuda <b>derive</b> that the Levites spoke in Hebrew <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“voice”</b> that is written with regard to the Levites (Deuteronomy 27:14) and the word “voice” in the verse about <b>Moses</b> (Exodus 19:19). The Talmud answers: <b>He learned</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“speak”</b> and <b>“speak”</b> from his teacher, and <b>he did not learn</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“voice”</b> and <b>“voice”</b> from his teacher. |
| Deuteronomy 27:14 | “And the Levities shall speak and say” | Sotah 44b:13 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the first sentence in the Mishnah <b>saying? </b> The Mishnah is attempting to prove that the verses read during the ritual of breaking a heifer’s neck are to be recited in Hebrew, yet the verse does not offer any proof of this. <b>R' Abbahu said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the Mishnah <b>is saying: </b> The confession is recited in Hebrew, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the ritual of the heifer whose neck is broken: <b>“And they shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7), <b>and later it is stated</b> with regard to the curses stated on Mount Ebal: <b>“And the Levities shall speak and say”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as</b> the word <b>“speak” that is said later</b> with regard to the Levites is referring to a speech that <b>is</b> recited <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here</b> the declaration is recited <b>in the sacred tongue. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | and shall set it up in a hidden place” | Avodah Zarah52a:11 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> as for the opinion of <b>R' Akiva, we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a non-Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>prohibited immediately. From where do we</b> derive that <b>a Jew’s</b> object of idol worship is not forbidden <b>until it is worshipped? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>the verse states: </b> “Cursed be the man who shall make a graven or molten image…<b>and shall set it up in a hidden place”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15). This indicates that the idol is not rendered forbidden <b>until</b> the idolater <b>performs</b> in service of the idol those <b>matters, </b> i.e., rites, <b>that are</b> performed <b>in a hidden</b> place. |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | as it is stated: “And shall set it up in a hidden place” | Avodah Zarah52a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, R' Yishmael, how does he interpret this verse? The Talmud answers: R' Yishmael <b>requires that</b> verse <b>for that which R' Yitzḥak</b> says, <b>as R' Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship requires interment? </b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And shall set it up in a hidden place”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15), which R' Yitzḥak interprets as requiring one to inter the idol in a hidden place. |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | The verse states: “Cursed be the man who shall make a graven or molten image, | Avodah Zarah52a:5 | The Talmud asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>with regard to</b> rendering <b>the man</b> who made the idol <b>liable for</b> the <b>sin, </b> but the object of idol worship <b>does not become prohibited</b> until it is worshipped? The Talmud answers: <b>The verse states: “Cursed be the man who shall make a graven or molten image, </b> an abomination to YHWH, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and shall set it up in a hidden place” (Deuteronomy 27:15), which indicates that <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> its <b>making</b> the person who made the idol <b>is liable to be cursed. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | It is written: “An abomination to the Lord” | Avodah Zarah52a:6 | The Talmud asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>with regard to</b> rendering <b>the man</b> who made the idol <b>liable to be cursed, </b> but the object of idol worship <b>does not become prohibited</b> until it is worshipped? The Talmud answers: <b>It is written: “An abomination to YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15). This indicates that the idol itself is an abomination and is therefore prohibited from the time that it is made. |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | be revoked? But isn’t it written: “And shall set it up in a hidden place” | Avodah Zarah52b:15 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught R' Shimon, son of R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the following version of the Mishnah: <b>A non-Jew can revoke</b> the status of <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and</b> the status of the idol <b>of another</b> non-Jew. R' Shimon <b>said to him: My teacher, in your youth, </b> i.e., when you were younger, <b>you taught us</b> a different version of the Mishnah: <b>A non-Jew can revoke</b> the status of <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and</b> the status of the object of idol worship <b>of a Jew. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Can</b> the status of <b>a Jew’s</b> idol <b>be revoked? But isn’t it written: “And shall set it up in a hidden place”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15), from which the rabbis derived that a Jew’s idol requires interment? <b>R' Hillel ben Volas, said: No, </b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the non-Jew <b>has partnership in</b> the idol, and therefore it is possible to say that its status can be revoked. |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | and it is written: “Cursed [ arur ] be the man who fashions a graven image, | Shevuot 36a:5 | There is an element of <b>curse within it, as it is written</b> with regard to the ceremony at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal: <b>“And these shall stand for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13), <b>and it is written: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] be the man who fashions a graven image, </b> an abomination to YHWH, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen” (Deuteronomy 27:15). |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | curse: “Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image” | Sotah 32a:12 | The Levites then <b>turned to face Mount Gerizim and opened with</b> the <b>blessing: Blessed be the man who does not make a graven or molten image</b> (see Deuteronomy 27:15), <b>and these</b> people <b>and those</b> people, i.e., the two groups standing on either mountain, <b>answered: Amen. </b> Then <b>they turned to face Mount Ebal and opened with</b> the <b>curse: “Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15), <b>and these</b> people <b>and those</b> people <b>answered: Amen. </b> They continued in this manner <b>until they completed</b> reciting all of the <b>blessings and curses. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 27:15 | “Cursed is the man who makes a graven or molten image” | Sotah 37b:9 | This is proved from the verse: <b>“Cursed is the man who makes a graven or molten image”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15). <b>Is a curse a sufficient</b> consequence <b>for</b> the actions of an idol worshipper? He has rebelled against the fundamental tenet of the Torah. <b>Rather, this</b> is referring to <b>one who had sex with a forbidden relative and bore</b> her a <i>mamzer</i> <b>son. And</b> the son, who is not allowed to marry a Jew of unflawed lineage, <b>went</b> to live <b>among the</b> other <b>nations of the world and engaged in idol worship. His father and mother are cursed for causing him</b> to worship idols. Likewise, the rest of the curses refer to sins that are the result of adultery. |
| Deuteronomy 27:20 | his descendants are destined to stand on Mount Eival and say: “Cursed be he that lies with his father’s wife; | Shabbat 55b:7 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Shimon ben Elazar says: This righteous person, </b> Reuben, <b>was saved from that sin</b> of adultery, <b>and that action did not come to</b> be performed by <b>him? Is it possible</b> that <b>his descendants are destined to stand on Mount Eival and say: “Cursed be he that lies with his father’s wife; </b> because he uncovers his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, amen” (Deuteronomy 27:20), <b>and this sin will come to</b> be performed by <b>him? </b> Is it conceivable that the members of a tribe would curse their ancestor? <b>How</b> then <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And he lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine”? </b> It is understood as follows: <b>He protested the affront to his mother. He said: If my mother’s sister</b> Rachel <b>was a rival to my mother, will my mother’s sister’s concubine be a rival to my mother? He</b> immediately <b>stood and rearranged her bed</b> so that Jacob would enter Leah’s tent. |
| Deuteronomy 27:21 | says: “Cursed be he who sleeps with any manner of beast” | Eruvin 55b:20 | <b>That was also taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Eliezer of Biriyya says: Those who dwell in huts are like those who dwell in graves. And with regard to</b> one who marries <b>their daughters, </b> the verse <b>says: “Cursed be he who sleeps with any manner of beast”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:21). |
| Deuteronomy 27:21 | states: “Cursed is he who lies with an animal” | Pesachim 49b:2 | <b>A baraita states: A person should always</b> be willing to <b>sell all he has</b> in order to <b>marry the daughter of a Torah scholar. </b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of a Torah scholar, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of the <b>great</b> people <b>of the generation, </b> who are pious although they are not Torah scholars. If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of the <b>great</b> people <b>of the generation, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the heads of the congregations. </b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of <b>the heads of the congregations, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the charity collectors. </b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of <b>the charity collectors, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the schoolteachers. </b> However, <b>he should not marry the daughter of an am ha'aretz [<i>am ha’aretz</i>] because they are vermin and their wives are</b> similar to <b>a creeping animal, </b> as their lifestyle involves the violation of numerous prohibitions. <b>And with regard to their daughters</b> the verse <b>states: “Cursed is he who lies with an animal”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:21), as they are similar to animals in that they lack any knowledge or moral sense. |
| Deuteronomy 27:26 | acceptance of the statement within it, as it is written: “Cursed is he who shall not confirm the matters of this Torah to perform them; and all the people shall say: Amen” | Shevuot 36a:11 | There is an element of <b>acceptance of the statement within it, as it is written: “Cursed is he who shall not confirm the matters of this Torah to perform them; and all the people shall say: Amen”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:26), expressing their agreement to fulfill all the matters of the Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 28:1 | “And it shall come to pass [ vehaya ], if you shall hearken diligently” | Bava Batra89a:1 | <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you shall hearken diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:1), <b>until: “To serve them [<i>le’ovdam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:14), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. <b>And he cursed them with twenty-two</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“But it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you will not hearken</b> to the voice of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 28:15), <b>until: “And no man shall buy [<i>koneh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:68). This verse ends with a letter <i>heh</i>, which comes just before <i>vav</i> in the alphabet. Starting with a <i>vav</i> and ending with a <i>heh</i> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. |
| Deuteronomy 28:1 | it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, if you will hearken diligently [ shamoa tishma ] unto | Sukkah 46b:1 | <b>holds</b> that which is placed within it, while <b>a full</b> vessel <b>does not hold</b> it. <b>However, the attribute of God, </b> is: If God adds to someone who is <b>a full vessel</b> in terms of knowledge or good attributes, <b>he holds</b> it; a person who is <b>an empty</b> vessel <b>will not hold</b> it. This is alluded to by the verse where <b>it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, if you will hearken diligently [<i>shamoa tishma</i>] unto</b> the voice of YHWH your God, to observe to do all his commandments” (Deuteronomy 28:1). This verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>If you hearken [<i>shamoa</i>]</b> in the present, <b>you will hearken [<i>tishma</i>]</b> in the future as well; <b>and if not, you will not hearken. Alternatively: If you hearkened to the old, </b> i.e., if you review what you already learned, <b>you will hearken to the new</b> as well. <b>“But if your heart turns away” (</b>Deuteronomy 30:17), <b>you will no longer</b> be able to <b>hearken. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:3 | “Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field” | Bava Metzia107a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But when R' Abba encountered Rav’s students</b> he <b>said to them: What does Rav say with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>these verses</b> of blessing: <b>“Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:3), and: <b>“Blessed shall you be when you enter, and blessed shall you be when you exit”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:6)? |
| Deuteronomy 28:6 | “Blessed shall you be when you enter, and blessed shall you be when you exit” | Bava Metzia107a:12 | The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But when R' Abba encountered Rav’s students</b> he <b>said to them: What does Rav say with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>these verses</b> of blessing: <b>“Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:3), and: <b>“Blessed shall you be when you enter, and blessed shall you be when you exit”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:6)? |
| Deuteronomy 28:7 | masculine form, as it is written: “They shall come out against you one way [ derekh ], and shall flee before you seven [ shiva ] ways” | Kiddushin 2b:7 | The Talmud challenges: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a Mishnah (<i>Nazir</i> 65b): <b>One examines a <i>zav</i> in seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways [<i>derakhim</i>], </b> where <i>shiva</i> is formulated in the masculine, <b>let it teach: Seven [<i>sheva</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine. The Talmud answers: The Mishnah uses the masculine formulation of the term seven <b>because it wanted to teach: <i>Derekh</i>, and we find</b> that the word <b><i>derekh</i> is referred to</b> in the <b>masculine form, as it is written: “They shall come out against you one way [<i>derekh</i>], and shall flee before you seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:7). The Talmud asks: <b>If so, the verses contradict each other, </b> as in one verse the term <i>derekh</i> is masculine, and in the other verse it is feminine. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the <i>mishnayot</i> contradict each other, </b> as in one Mishnah <i>derekh</i> is masculine while in the other it is feminine. |
| Deuteronomy 28:7 | feminine. There, that | Kiddushin 2b:8 | The Talmud answers: <b>The verses do not contradict each other. Here, </b> that verse: “The way in which they must walk” (Exodus 18:20), <b>is referring to the Torah, </b> i.e., the way mentioned here is referring to the path of the Torah, <b>and Torah is referred to</b> in the <b>feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of YHWH is perfect [<i>temima</i>], restoring the soul”</b> (Psalms 19:8). The word <i>temima</i> is in the feminine. Consequently, in reference to the Torah the verse <b>writes: </b> <i>Derekh</i>, <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There, that</b> verse: “Shall flee before you seven ways” (Deuteronomy 28:7), <b>is referring to war, </b> and <b>as it is the way of a man to wage war and it is not the way of a woman to wage war, </b> it is appropriate to speak in the masculine. Therefore, the verse <b>writes</b> the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:8 | And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Blessing is found only in a matter concealed from the eye, as it is stated: “The Lord will command blessing with you in your storehouses” | Bava Metzia42a:4 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak says: Blessing is found only in a matter concealed from the eye, as it is stated: “YHWH will command blessing with you in your storehouses”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:8), where the grain is concealed. <b>The school of R' Yishmael taught: Blessing is found only in a matter</b> over <b>which the eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “YHWH will command blessing with you in your storehouses. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:8 | As it is stated: “The Lord will command His blessing upon you in your barns [ ba’asamekha ]” | Taanit 8b:13 | <b>And</b> apropos blessings, <b>R' Yitzḥak said: A blessing is found only in an object that is hidden [<i>samui</i>] from the eye, </b> not in an item visible to all, as public miracles are exceedingly rare. <b>As it is stated: “YHWH will command His blessing upon you in your barns [<i>ba’asamekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:8). R' Yitzḥak’s exposition is based on the linguistic similarity between <i>samui</i> and <i>asamekha</i>. Likewise, <b>the school of R' Yishmael taught: A blessing is found only in an object that is not exposed to the eye, as it is stated: “YHWH will command His blessing upon you in your barns. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | “All the peoples of the earth shall see | Berakhot 56a:8 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“All the peoples of the earth shall see</b> that the name of YHWH is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said: Your name will become well-known as head of the yeshiva, and you will be feared by all.

Indeed, <b>the next day, the king’s treasury was burglarized, and they came and apprehended Rava. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | don phylacteries in a dream should anticipate greatness, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you; | Berakhot 57a:3 | <b>One who</b> sees himself <b>don tefillin in a dream should anticipate greatness, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of YHWH is called upon you; </b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: That the Name of YHWH is called upon you, refers to tefillin of the head, </b> as they represent God’s name upon man. <b>One who</b> sees himself <b>pray in a dream, </b> it is <b>an auspicious omen. </b> However, the Talmud adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where he saw in the dream that he <b>had not</b> yet <b>finished</b> his prayer and is therefore still close to God. If, in the dream, he had already finished his prayer, it is not an omen. |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | that phylacteries provide strength for Israel? As it is written: “And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you, and they will fear you” | Berakhot 6a:19 | The Talmud asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that tefillin provide strength for Israel? As it is written: “And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of YHWH is called upon you, and they will fear you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the tefillin of the head, </b> upon which the name of God is written in fulfillment of the verse: “That the name of YHWH is called upon you. ” |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you; | Chullin 89a:2 | The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, the strap of</b> the <b>tefillin</b> imparts benefit, <b>as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of YHWH is called upon you; </b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the tefillin of the head, </b> upon which the name of God is written. tefillin therefore impart the splendor and grandeur of God and are a fit reward. <b>But what is</b> the benefit imparted by <b>the thread of sky-blue wool? </b> |

| Deuteronomy 28:10 | “And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you” | Menachot 35b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And all the nations of the land shall see that the name of YHWH is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10), it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: This</b> is a reference to <b>the tefillin of the head, </b> upon which the name of God is written, as they demonstrate to all that the name of God is called upon the Jewish people. With regard to the statement of God to Moses: <b>“And I will remove My hand, and you will see My back”</b> (Exodus 33:23), <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>R' Shimon Ḥasida says: </b> This <b>teaches that God showed Moses the knot of</b> the <b>tefillin</b> of the head. |
| Deuteronomy 28:10 | as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you; | Sotah 17a:22 | The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, the strap of</b> the <b>tefillin</b> impart benefit, <b>as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of YHWH is called upon you; </b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the tefillin of the head, </b> upon which the name of God is written. tefillin therefore impart the splendor and grandeur of God and are a fit reward. |
| Deuteronomy 28:12 | descend from the good storehouse, as it is stated: “The Lord will open to you His good storehouse, | Bava Batra25b:7 | <b>And Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the Temple was destroyed, the rains no</b> longer <b>descend from the good storehouse, as it is stated: “YHWH will open to you His good storehouse, </b> the skies, to give the rain of your land in its season” (Deuteronomy 28:12). <b>In a time when the Jewish people perform God’s will, and the Jewish people are settled in their land, rain descends from the good storehouse. In a time when the Jewish people are not settled in their land, rain does not descend from the good storehouse. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:12 | For it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse, | Chagigah 12b:10 | <b><i>Makhon</i>, </b> dwelling place, <b>is where there are storehouses of snow and storehouses of hail, and the upper chamber of harmful dews, and the upper chamber of drops, and the room of tempests and storms, and the cave of mist. And the doors</b> of all these are made of <b>fire. </b> How do we know that there are storehouses for evil things? <b>For it is stated: “YHWH will open for you His good storehouse, </b> the heavens” (Deuteronomy 28:12), which indicates the existence of a storehouse that contains the opposite of good. |
| Deuteronomy 28:12 | The key of rain, as it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its due time” | Taanit 2a:13 | R' Yoḥanan cites verses in support of his claim. <b>The key of rain, as it is stated: “YHWH will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its due time”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12), indicates that rainfall is controlled by God Himself. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the key of birthing</b> is maintained by God? <b>As it is written: “And God remembered Rachel and listened</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:12 | pocket is blessed on it, as it is stated: “To give the rain of your land in its due time, and to bless all the work of your hand” | Taanit 8b:12 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak said: Sun on Shabbat is charity for the poor, </b> who are then able to enjoy the outdoors without suffering from cold. <b>As it is stated: “But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings”</b> (Malachi 3:20). <b>And R' Yitzḥak</b> further <b>said: The day of the rains is great, as even a <i>peruta</i> in</b> one’s <b>pocket is blessed on it, as it is stated: “To give the rain of your land in its due time, and to bless all the work of your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12). |
| Deuteronomy 28:12 | to give the rain of your land” | Taanit 9a:8 | § After this brief digression, the Talmud turns to the 5th in the series of statements by R' Yoḥanan concerning rain. <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Rain</b> falls even <b>for the sake of an individual, </b> in response to the petition of a single person in need of rain, whereas a blessing of <b>sustenance</b> comes only <b>for the sake of many. Rain</b> falls even <b>for the sake of an individual, as it is written: “YHWH will open for you His good treasure, </b> the heavens, <b>to give the rain of your land”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12). The fact that this verse is written in the second person singular demonstrates that rain can fall even for the sake of an individual. R' Yoḥanan further proves that <b>sustenance</b> comes <b>for the sake of many, as it is written: “Behold I will cause to rain bread from the heavens for you”</b> (Exodus 16:4). Here, God is referring to the people in the plural form. |

This verse ends with a letter <i>heh</i>, which comes just before <i>vav</i> in the alphabet. Starting with a <i>vav</i> and ending with a <i>heh</i> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. |
| Deuteronomy 28:15 | “But it shall come to pass [ vehaya ], if you will not hearken | Bava Batra89a:1 | <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you shall hearken diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:1), <b>until: “To serve them [<i>le’ovdam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:14), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. <b>And he cursed them with twenty-two</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“But it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you will not hearken</b> to the voice of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 28:15), <b>until: “And no man shall buy [<i>koneh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:68). This verse ends with a letter <i>heh</i>, which comes just before <i>vav</i> in the alphabet. Starting with a <i>vav</i> and ending with a <i>heh</i> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. |
| Deuteronomy 28:24 | “The Lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust” | Taanit 3b:9 | § It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Clouds and winds are</b> so significant that, in terms of their benefit, they are <b>secondary</b> only <b>to rain. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this claim is correct? <b>Ulla, and some say Rav Yehuda, said: </b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to the clouds and winds <b>that</b> come <b>after rainfall. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> clouds and winds that come after rain <b>are beneficial? But isn’t it written</b> in the chapter of the curses: <b>“YHWH will make the rain of your land powder and dust”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:24), <b>and Ulla, and some say Rav Yehuda, said: </b> This curse is referring to <b>winds that come after rain, </b> as they raise up powder and dust? |
| Deuteronomy 28:24 | “Powder and dust from the heavens” | Taanit 9b:15 | The Talmud asks: <b>And R' Eliezer, </b> how does he explain this verse? The Talmud answers: According to R' Eliezer, <b>since</b> the clouds <b>ascend there, </b> to the heavens, the verse <b>“who waters the mountains from His upper chambers” calls</b> and describes rainfall as descending from the heavens. <b>As, if you do not say so, </b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Powder and dust from the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:24), <b>where do you find</b> this phenomenon? Is there powder and dust in Heaven? <b>Rather, </b> you must say that <b>since</b> dust <b>rises up there, they are called</b> dust: <b>“From the heavens. ” So too, </b> as the clouds <b>ascend there, they are called</b> and described: “Who waters the mountains <b>from His upper chambers. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:27 | heal? But isn’t it written: “The Lord will smite you with the boil of Egypt, | Bekhorot 41a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> does <b>a moist</b> boil <b>heal? But isn’t it written: “YHWH will smite you with the boil of Egypt, </b> and with the hemorrhoids, and with <i>garav</i>, and with <i>ḥares</i>, from which you cannot be healed” (Deuteronomy 28:27). <b>And since it is written: “And with <i>ḥares</i>, ”</b> which is referring to boils that are as hard as earthenware [<i>ḥeres</i>], <b>moist <i>garav</i> is</b> thereby <b>stated, and</b> with regard to both types that verse <b>states: “From which you cannot be healed. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:27 | “with hemorrhoids [ bafolim ]” | Megillah 25b:15 | § <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of the verses that are written in the Torah in a coarse manner are read in a refined manner. For example, </b> the term <b>“shall lie with her</b> [<b><i>yishgalena</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:30) is read as though it said <b><i>yishkavena</i>, </b> which is a more refined term. The term <b>“with hemorrhoids [<i>bafolim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:27) is read <b><i>bateḥorim</i>. </b> The term <b>“doves’ dung [<i>ḥiryonim</i>]”</b> (II Kings 6:25) is read <b><i>divyonim</i>. </b> The phrase <b>“to eat their own excrement [<i>ḥoreihem</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei shineihem</i>]”</b> (II Kings 18:27) is read with more delicate terms: <b>To eat their own excrement [<i>tzo’atam</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei ragleihem</i>]. </b> |

I was perplexed: <b>What</b> does it <b>matter to a blind</b> person <b>whether</b> it is <b>dark or light? </b> He cannot see in any event, so why does the verse speak about a blind man in the darkness? |

| Deuteronomy 28:31 | “Your ox shall be slain before your eyes | Berakhot 56a:2 | The Talmud relates: <b>Bar Haddaya was an interpreter of dreams. </b> For <b>one who gave him a fee, he would interpret</b> the dream <b>favorably, and</b> for <b>one who did not give him a fee, he would interpret</b> the dream <b>unfavorably. </b> The Talmud relates: There was an incident in which both <b>Abaye and Rava saw an</b> identical <b>dream</b> and they asked bar Haddaya to interpret it. <b>Abaye gave him money</b> and paid his fee, <b>while Rava did not give him</b> money. <b>They said to him: </b> The verse: <b>“Your ox shall be slain before your eyes</b> and you shall not eat thereof” (Deuteronomy 28:31) <b>was read to us in our dream.

To Abaye he said: Your business will profit and you will be unable to eat due to the joy in your heart. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:32 | The verse: “Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people” | Berakhot 56a:4 | They said to him: <b>The verse: “Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:32), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said: Your sons and daughters will be numerous. You say, </b> that they should marry <b>your relatives and</b> your wife <b>says</b> that they should marry <b>her relatives and she will impose</b> her will <b>upon you and they will be given</b> in marriage <b>to her relatives, which is like another nation</b> as far as you are concerned. <b>To Rava he said: Your wife will die and your sons and daughters will come into the hands of another woman. As Rava said</b> that <b>R' Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> in the verse: <b>“Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people”? This</b> refers to <b>the father’s wife, </b> the stepmother. |
| Deuteronomy 28:32 | “Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people” | Yevamot 63b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:32), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is</b> a reference to the children’s <b>father’s wife, </b> their stepmother. With regard to the verse: <b>“I will provoke them with a vile nation”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:21), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is a bad wife whose marriage contract is large. R' Eliezer says</b> that <b>these are apostates, and so too</b> the verse <b>states: “The vile man has said in his heart: There is no God, </b> they have dealt corruptly” (Psalms 14:1), which proves that an apostate is called vile. |
| Deuteronomy 28:36 | “The Lord will lead you, and your king | Horayot 12a:2 | <b>And who sequestered</b> the Ark? <b>Josiah, king of Judea, sequestered it, as he saw that it is written in the Torah</b> in the portion of rebuke: <b>“YHWH will lead you, and your king</b> whom you shall establish over you, unto a nation that you have not known” (Deuteronomy 28:36). <b>He commanded and</b> the people <b>sequestered them, as it is stated: “And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, and who were sacred unto YHWH: Place the sacred Ark in the room that Solomon, son of David, king of Israel built; there shall be no more burden upon your shoulders.

| Deuteronomy 28:36 | bury it? He saw that it is written: “The Lord will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you, | Yoma 52b:12 | § <b>And who buried</b> the Ark? <b>Josiah, </b> king of Judea, <b>buried it. And what did he see that</b> he decided to <b>bury it? He saw that it is written: “YHWH will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you, </b> to a nation that you have not known” (Deuteronomy 28:36). Since he knew that the Jewish people would ultimately be exiled, he felt it was better that the Ark should not be disgraced in exile, and therefore <b>he arose and buried it. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:38 | “You shall carry much seed out into the field, | Berakhot 56a:6 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“You shall carry much seed out into the field, </b> and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it” (Deuteronomy 28:38), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said from the beginning</b> of the verse, that he will enjoy an abundant harvest. <b>To Rava he said from the end</b> of the verse, that his harvest will be destroyed. |
| Deuteronomy 28:39 | but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather [ te’egor ]” | Sanhedrin 7a:16 | The Talmud returns to analyzing the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> expression: <b>“You shall not be afraid [<i>taguru</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>is a term for gathering in, </b> so that the term may be interpreted to mean that a judge may not keep his ruling to himself? <b>Rav Naḥman said: The verse states: </b> “You shalt plant vineyards and dress them, <b>but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather [<i>te’egor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:39). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “She provides her bread in the summer, and gathers [<i>agra</i>] her food in the harvest”</b> (Proverbs 6:8). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “A wise son gathers [<i>oger</i>] in the summer”</b> (Proverbs 10:5). |
| Deuteronomy 28:40 | The one who teaches mashilin is not mistaken, as it is written: “For your olives will fall [ yishal ]” | Beitzah 35b:9 | <b>Mar Zutra said: The one who teaches <i>mashilin</i> is not mistaken, and the one who teaches <i>mashḥilin</i> is not mistaken, </b> as support can be found for both versions. He elaborates: <b>The one who teaches <i>mashilin</i> is not mistaken, as it is written: “For your olives will fall [<i>yishal</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:40). <i>Mashilin</i> would therefore mean: To cause to fall. <b>And he who teaches <i>mashḥilin</i> is not mistaken, as we learned</b> the following cases in a Mishnah that lists blemishes that invalidate an animal for sacrifice: <b>The <i>shaḥul</i> and the <i>kasul</i>. </b> The Mishnah explains these terms: <b><i>Shaḥul</i></b> is referring to an animal <b>whose thigh is dislocated, </b> i.e., it has slipped out of place; <b><i>kasul</i></b> is referring to an animal <b>one of whose thighs is higher than the other. </b> This shows that the root <i>sh-ḥ-l-</i> is referring to something that has slipped down from its place. |
| Deuteronomy 28:40 | “You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, | Berakhot 56a:7 | They said to him: The verse: <b>“You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, </b> but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off” (Deuteronomy 28:40), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. And again, <b>to Abaye he said from the beginning</b> of the verse. <b>To Rava he said from the end</b> of the verse. |
| Deuteronomy 28:41 | “You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity” | Berakhot 56a:3 | <b>They said to him: </b> The verse, <b>“You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:41), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. He interpreted their dreams, and <b>to Rava he said its</b> literal, <b>adverse</b> sense. <b>To Abaye he said: Your sons and daughters will be numerous, and your daughters will be married to outsiders and it will seem to you as if they were taken in captivity. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:42 | shall the locust consume” | Bava Kamma116b:18 | <b>And one who teaches</b> the Mishnah using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, as it is written: </b> “All your trees and the fruit of your land <b>shall the locust consume”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:42), <b>and, </b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> this phrase as: <b>Shall the locust [<i>sakke’a</i>] consume. </b> Consequently, <i>massikin</i> are those who consume the property of others. |
| Deuteronomy 28:47 | from here: “Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joyfulness, and with goodness of heart” | Arakhin 11a:11 | <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that the source for the requirement to accompany the Temple offerings with song is derived <b>from here: “Because you did not serve YHWH your God with joyfulness, and with goodness of heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:47). <b>What is</b> this <b>service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>with joyfulness and with goodness of heart? You must say</b> that <b>this is song. </b> The Talmud objects: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that this service is studying the <b>words of Torah, as it is written: “The precepts of YHWH are upright, rejoicing the heart”</b> (Psalms 19:9). The Talmud explains: Torah <b>is</b> indeed <b>called</b> a matter that <b>rejoices the heart, </b> but <b>it is not called “goodness. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:48 | others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy | Berakhot 35b:7 | <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Is it possible that a person plows in the plowing season and sows in the sowing season and harvests in the harvest season and threshes in the threshing season and winnows in the windy season, </b> as grain is separated from the chaff by means of the wind, and is constantly busy; <b>what will become of Torah? Rather, </b> one must dedicate himself exclusively to Torah at the expense of other endeavors; as <b>when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, </b> and foreigners will be your plowmen and your vinedressers” (Isaiah 61:5). <b>When Israel does not perform God’s will, their work is performed by them</b> themselves, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall gather your grain. ” Moreover, </b> if Israel fails to perform God’s will, <b>others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy</b> whom God shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness and in want of all things” (Deuteronomy 28:48). |
| Deuteronomy 28:48 | in want of all things; | Nedarim 41a:1 | <b>and a rug, </b> as an exile needs those items and they are portable. The rabbis interpreted the following verse describing the exile experience: “Therefore shall you serve your enemy whom YHWH shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and <b>in want of all things; </b> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you” (Deuteronomy 28:48). <b>R' Ami said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b> “In want of all things” means <b>without a lamp and without a table</b> to eat upon. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Without a wife.

| Deuteronomy 28:49 | scroll: “The Lord will bring a nation against you from far, | Sukkah 51b:9 | <b>When</b> Alexander <b>arrived, he found them, </b> and saw <b>that they were reading</b> the verse <b>in the</b> Torah <b>scroll: “YHWH will bring a nation against you from far, </b> from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand” (Deuteronomy 28:49). <b>He said, </b> referring to himself: <b>Now, since that man sought to come by ship in ten days, </b> and <b>a wind carried it and the ship arrived in</b> only <b>five days, </b> apparently the verse referring a vulture swooping down is referring to me and heavenly forces are assisting me.

| Deuteronomy 28:55 | matzikin does not err, as it is written: “In the siege and in the distress [ matzok ] | Bava Kamma116b:17 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One who teaches</b> the Mishnah using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, and one who teaches</b> the Mishnah using the term <b><i>matzikin</i></b> also <b>does not err, </b> as both terms may be used to refer to thugs. <b>One who teaches</b> the Mishnah using the term <b><i>matzikin</i> does not err, as it is written: “In the siege and in the distress [<i>matzok</i>]</b> with which your enemies shall distress you” (Deuteronomy 28:55). Consequently, <i>matzikin</i> are individuals who cause distress to others. |
| Deuteronomy 28:56 | “The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot | Gittin 56a:13 | <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai read concerning her</b> a verse found in the section of the Torah listing the curses that will befall Israel: <b>“The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot</b> upon the ground” (Deuteronomy 28:56). <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that she did not step on dung, but rather <b>she ate a fig of R' Tzadok, and became disgusted and died. </b> What are these figs? <b>R' Tzadok observed fasts</b> for <b>forty years, </b> praying <b>that Jerusalem would not be destroyed. </b> He became so emaciated from fasting <b>that when he would eat something it was visible from the outside</b> of his body. <b>And when he would eat</b> after a fast <b>they would bring him figs</b> and <b>he would suck out their liquid and cast</b> the rest <b>away. </b> It was one such fig that Marta bat Baitos found and that caused her death. |
| Deuteronomy 28:57 | “And against her afterbirth that emerges from between her legs [ ragleha ]” | Yevamot 103a:14 | It was taught in the Mishnah that if one’s legs were amputated <b>from the knee and above, </b> the <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid. This implies that the <i>regel</i> includes the calf but not the thigh. <b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> from the verse: <b>“And against her afterbirth that emerges from between her legs [<i>ragleha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:57), implying that <i>regel</i> includes even the thighs. <b>Abaye said: </b> The verse actually means between her feet, as <b>when</b> a woman <b>crouches to give birth, she pushes her heels into her thighs and she gives birth, </b> so it appears as if the fetus emerges from between her feet. |
| Deuteronomy 28:58 | as it is written: “If you will not observe to perform all the matters of this Torah” | Makkot 13b:4 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yishmael, </b> who holds that even those liable to be executed are liable to receive lashes? It is <b>as it is written: “If you will not observe to perform all the matters of this Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:58), <b>and it is written</b> immediately thereafter, with regard to the punishment of one who violates that verse: <b>“And God will make your plagues wondrous [<i>vehifla</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59). The rabbis interpreted that verse: <b>This</b> term, <b><i>hafla’a</i>, I do not know what its</b> meaning <b>is. When</b> the verse <b>states</b> concerning those liable to receive lashes: <b>“And the judge shall cause him to lie down [<i>vehippilo</i>] and to be beaten before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>you must say</b> that <b>this <i>hafla’a</i> is</b> a term referring to <b>lashes, and it is written</b> that this <i>hafla’a</i> is administered in any case where one does not fulfill the verse <b>“if you will not observe to perform all</b> the matters of this Torah,” including those prohibitions punishable by death. |
| Deuteronomy 28:58 | Rabbi Oshaya says: The verse states: “If you will not observe | Temurah 3b:15 | § R' Yosei HaGelili also lists <b>one who curses another using the name</b> of God as liable to be flogged.

| Deuteronomy 28:59 | and evil and faithful sicknesses” | Avodah Zarah55a:7 | <b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which R' Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: </b> “Then YHWH will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues and faithful, <b>and evil and faithful sicknesses”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59)? The term <b>“evil”</b> does not mean that the agent of sickness is in itself evil. Rather, this is referring <b>to its mission, </b> which is to cause harm. The term <b>“and faithful</b> sicknesses” indicates that the illnesses are faithful <b>to their oath</b> and adhere to the times designated for the affliction. |
| Deuteronomy 28:59 | “And God will make your plagues wondrous [ vehifla ]” | Makkot 13b:4 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of R' Yishmael, </b> who holds that even those liable to be executed are liable to receive lashes? It is <b>as it is written: “If you will not observe to perform all the matters of this Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:58), <b>and it is written</b> immediately thereafter, with regard to the punishment of one who violates that verse: <b>“And God will make your plagues wondrous [<i>vehifla</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59). The rabbis interpreted that verse: <b>This</b> term, <b><i>hafla’a</i>, I do not know what its</b> meaning <b>is. When</b> the verse <b>states</b> concerning those liable to receive lashes: <b>“And the judge shall cause him to lie down [<i>vehippilo</i>] and to be beaten before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>you must say</b> that <b>this <i>hafla’a</i> is</b> a term referring to <b>lashes, and it is written</b> that this <i>hafla’a</i> is administered in any case where one does not fulfill the verse <b>“if you will not observe to perform all</b> the matters of this Torah,” including those prohibitions punishable by death. |
| Deuteronomy 28:59 | “And the Lord will make your plagues astonishing, | Shabbat 138b:9 | With regard to <b>Torah, </b> Rav Huna related <b>that Rav said: The Torah is destined to be forgotten from the Jewish people. It is stated</b> at the conclusion of the curses in the Torah’s reproof: <b>“And YHWH will make your plagues astonishing, </b> and the plagues of your seed, great plagues of long continuance, and evil diseases of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:59). <b>This</b> term of <b>astonishment, </b> mentioned in the verse in addition to the explicit punishments, <b>I do not know what it is. </b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states</b> elsewhere: <b>“Therefore, behold, I will continue to astonish this people with wondrous astonishment, </b> and the wisdom of its wise will be lost, and the understanding of its men of understanding shall be hidden” (Isaiah 29:14), you must <b>say: This astonishment</b> is referring to forgetting the <b>Torah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:59 | “Then the Lord will make your plagues wondrous [ vehifla ]” | Temurah 3b:15 | § R' Yosei HaGelili also lists <b>one who curses another using the name</b> of God as liable to be flogged. The Talmud asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>R' Elazar says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: The verse states: “If you will not observe</b> to perform all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 28:58). This refers to one who curses using the name of God. <b>And it is written</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“Then YHWH will make your plagues wondrous [<i>vehifla</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59). With regard to <b>this</b> term <b><i>hafla’a</i>, I do not know what its</b> meaning <b>is. When it says: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down [<i>vehippilo</i>] and to be beaten before him”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2), <b>you must say</b> that the term <b><i>hafla’a</i> is</b> referring to <b>lashes. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:61 | “Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this Torah” | Gittin 58a:6 | It is related that it once happened that they did this to two children, and <b>one</b> of them <b>said to the other: Where is this</b> affliction <b>written</b> in the Torah? The other <b>said to him: </b> As it is written: <b>“Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:61). The first one <b>said: How far am I</b> in my studies <b>from this, </b> i.e., how much more would I have had to learn in order to reach this verse? The other <b>said: Had you gone on one and a half columns [<i>pusta</i>], </b> you would have reached this. The first child <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Had I reached this</b> verse, <b>I would not have needed you, </b> as I would have known on my own that the verse was speaking about this. |
| Deuteronomy 28:63 | Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, | Megillah 10b:24 | <b>R' Yehoshua ben Levi introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And it shall come to pass, that as YHWH rejoiced over you to do you good, </b> and to multiply you; so YHWH will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you” (Deuteronomy 28:63). The verse indicates that just as YHWH rejoiced in the good he did on behalf of Israel, so too, YHWH <b>will rejoice to cause you harm. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:63 | will rejoice [ ken yasis ]” | Megillah 10b:27 | <b>R' Elazar said</b> that this is how the matter is to be understood: Indeed, God Himself <b>does not rejoice</b> over the downfall of the wicked, <b>but He causes others to rejoice. </b> The Talmud comments: One can <b>learn from</b> the language of the verse <b>as well, as it is written: “So</b> YHWH <b>will rejoice [<i>ken yasis</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:63). <b>And it is not written <i>yasus</i>, </b> the grammatical form of the verb meaning: He will rejoice. Rather, it is written <i>yasis</i>. The grammatical form of this verb indicates that one causes another to rejoice. Consequently, these words are understood to mean that God will cause others to rejoice. The Talmud concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> it that this is the case. |
| Deuteronomy 28:63 | will cause rejoicing [ yasis ] | Sanhedrin 39b:6 | <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He, </b> i.e., God, <b>does not rejoice</b> in their downfall, <b>but He</b> does <b>cause others</b> to feel <b>joy. </b> The Talmud comments: Accordingly, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written: </b> “And it shall come to pass, that as YHWH rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so YHWH <b>will cause rejoicing [<i>yasis</i>]</b> over you to cause you to perish” (Deuteronomy 28:63), <b>and it is not written: Will have joy [<i>yasus</i>]. </b> The term “<i>yasis</i>” connotes causing joy to others, not that God will experience joy Himself. The Talmud affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this inference that it is so. |
| Deuteronomy 28:65 | Moses said: “And among these nations you shall have no repose” | Makkot 24a:29 | <b>Moses said: “And among these nations you shall have no repose”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65). <b>Jeremiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “Even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest”</b> (Jeremiah 31:1), indicating that the Jewish people will find rest even in exile. |
| Deuteronomy 28:65 | hemorrhoids will control him, as it is stated: “But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul” | Nedarim 22a:10 | <b>And not only that, but</b> also <b>hemorrhoids will control him, as it is stated: “But YHWH shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65). <b>Which</b> is the <b>matter</b> of sickness <b>that causes failing of the eyes</b> in pain <b>and causes languishing of the soul? You must say this</b> is referring to <b>hemorrhoids. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:65 | “But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart” | Nedarim 22a:12 | With regard to the narrative itself, <b>R' Yoḥanan wondered: Now, it is written</b> in the passage of curses: <b>“But YHWH shall give you there a trembling heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65) and this <b>is written with regard to Babylonia, </b> because in the exile an individual possesses a trembling and angry heart. How is it possible that in Eretz Yisrael a person can get so angry as to murder another? Ulla <b>said to him: At that moment</b> when the incident occurred |
| Deuteronomy 28:66 | “And your life shall hang in doubt before you [ minneged ]” | Berakhot 24a:19 | Moreover, <b>the Symbolic Interpreters</b> of the Torah <b>said</b> that the verse: <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you [<i>minneged</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:66), that is the punishment of <b>one who hangs his tefillin. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 28:66 | as Rabbi Ḥanin said | Menachot 103b:21 | R' Beivai <b>was silent</b> and did not answer. <b>R' Zerika said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master does not respond</b> to the question? R' Beivai <b>said to him: How can I respond to him? </b> My circumstances can be described <b>as R' Ḥanin said</b> in interpreting the verse: “And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and you shall have no assurance of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who purchases grain from one year for the next, </b> because he is not certain that he will find grain to eat in the next year. |
| Deuteronomy 28:67 | “In the morning you will say, would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say, would that it were morning” | Sotah 49a:7 | § The Mishnah states that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of R' Yehoshua: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, there is no</b> day that does not include some form of curse. <b>Rava says: Each and every day is more cursed than the previous one, as it is stated</b> in the chapter detailing the curses in the book of Deuteronomy: <b>“In the morning you will say, would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say, would that it were morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:67). It is unclear <b>which morning</b> the verse means. <b>If we say</b> that in the evening he will wish it would be <b>the following morning, does he know what will be</b> the outcome of the next morning, which would cause him to yearn for its arrival? <b>Rather, </b> it must mean the morning <b>that has passed; </b> that is, in the evening they will pine for the previous morning, because their situation is continuously worsening. |
| Deuteronomy 28:68 | until: “And no man shall buy [ koneh ]” | Bava Batra89a:1 | <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you shall hearken diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:1), <b>until: “To serve them [<i>le’ovdam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:14), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. <b>And he cursed them with twenty-two</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“But it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you will not hearken</b> to the voice of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 28:15), <b>until: “And no man shall buy [<i>koneh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:68). This verse ends with a letter <i>heh</i>, which comes just before <i>vav</i> in the alphabet. Starting with a <i>vav</i> and ending with a <i>heh</i> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. |
| Deuteronomy 28:68 | woe and mourning. This is as it is written: “And there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondsmen and bondswomen, | Megillah 11a:10 | § The Talmud returns to its interpretation of the book of Esther. The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rav said: </b> The word <i>vayhi</i> may be understood as if it said <b><i>vai</i> and <i>hi</i>, </b> meaning <b>woe and mourning. This is as it is written: “And there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondsmen and bondswomen, </b> and no man shall buy you” (Deuteronomy 28:68). The repetitive nature of the verse, indicating that no one will be willing to buy you for servitude, but they will purchase you in order to murder you, indicates a doubly horrific situation, which is symbolized by the dual term <i>vayhi</i>, meaning woe and mourning. |
| Deuteronomy 28:69 | covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant” | Berakhot 5a:19 | <b>And that is</b> the statement of <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish, as R' Shimon ben Lakish said: </b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, and</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions. </b> The word <b>covenant is used with regard to salt, as it is written: “The salt of the covenant</b> with your God <b>should not be excluded</b> from your meal-offering; with all your sacrifices you must offer salt” (Leviticus 2:13). <b>And</b> the word <b>covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:69). <b>Just as, </b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens</b> the taste of <b>the meat</b> and renders it edible, <b>so too</b> in <b>the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions, </b> purifying him for a more sublime existence. |
| Deuteronomy 28:69 | Sinai, and so too at the plains of Moab, as it is stated: “These are the words of the covenant that the Lord commanded Moses | Sotah 37b:1 | every mitzva contains <b>four</b> aspects. <b>Four</b> general aspects <b>and four</b> specific aspects add up to <b>eight.

And so too at</b> Mount <b>Sinai, and so too at the plains of Moab, as it is stated: “These are the words of the covenant that YHWH commanded Moses</b> to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant that He made with them in Horeb” (Deuteronomy 28:69). <b>And it is written: “Observe therefore the words of this covenant”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:8). <b>It follows</b> that between the three events where sixteen covenants were made, God established <b>forty-eight covenants for each and every mitzva. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 29:3 | it is written: “But the Lord has not given you a heart | Avodah Zarah5b:2 | Yet <b>even Moses our teacher, </b> who said this to the Jewish people, <b>did not allude to the Jewish people until after forty years</b> that they should have stated this request, <b>as it is stated: “And I have led you forty years in the wilderness”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:4), which shows that Moses was speaking forty years after the revelation at Sinai. <b>And</b> at that point <b>it is written: “But YHWH has not given you a heart</b> to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day” (Deuteronomy 29:3). <b>Rabba said: Conclude from</b> here that <b>a person does not understand the opinion of his teacher until</b> after <b>forty years, </b> as Moses said this to the Jewish people only after forty years of learning Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 29:4 | as it is stated: “And I have led you forty years in the wilderness” | Avodah Zarah5b:2 | Yet <b>even Moses our teacher, </b> who said this to the Jewish people, <b>did not allude to the Jewish people until after forty years</b> that they should have stated this request, <b>as it is stated: “And I have led you forty years in the wilderness”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:4), which shows that Moses was speaking forty years after the revelation at Sinai. <b>And</b> at that point <b>it is written: “But YHWH has not given you a heart</b> to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day” (Deuteronomy 29:3). <b>Rabba said: Conclude from</b> here that <b>a person does not understand the opinion of his teacher until</b> after <b>forty years, </b> as Moses said this to the Jewish people only after forty years of learning Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 29:8 | will be successful. It is written in the Torah, as it is written: “Observe therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper” | Avodah Zarah19b:7 | The verse continues: <b>“And in whatsoever he does he shall prosper. ” R' Yehoshua ben Levi says: This matter is written in the Torah, and repeated in the Prophets, and stated a 3rd time in the Writings: </b> Concerning <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, <b>his property</b> dealings <b>will be successful. It is written in the Torah, as it is written: “Observe therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:8). |
| Deuteronomy 29:8 | “And you shall observe the matters of this covenant, | Makkot 22b:12 | <b>And the</b> attendant <b>flogging</b> the one receiving lashes <b>flogs [<i>makeh</i>] him with one hand with all his strength, and the</b> court <b>crier recites</b> the verses: <b>“If you do not observe to perform</b> all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, YHWH your God. <b>And YHWH will make your plagues [<i>makkotekha</i>] outstanding, and the plagues</b> of your descendants, and even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:58–59). <b>And</b> then <b>he returns to the beginning of the verse. </b> He also recites: <b>“And you shall observe the matters of this covenant, </b> and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper” (Deuteronomy 29:8), <b>and concludes</b> with the verse: <b>“And He is merciful and shall atone for transgression, and destroys not; </b> and many a time does He turn His anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath” (Psalms 78:38), <b>and</b> then <b>returns to the beginning of the verse</b> that starts: “If you do not observe to perform. ” |
| Deuteronomy 29:8 | as it is stated: “Observe the words of this covenant, va’asitem otam ” | Sanhedrin 99b:12 | <b>Reish Lakish said: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who teaches Torah to the son of another, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he formed</b> that student, <b>as it is stated: </b> “And Abram took Sarai his wife…<b>and the souls that they formed in Haran”</b> (Genesis 12:5). They are given credit for forming the students to whom they taught Torah. <b>R' Elazar says: </b> It is <b>as though he fashioned [<i>asa’an</i>] the words of Torah</b> themselves, <b>as it is stated: “Observe the words of this covenant, <i>va’asitem otam</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:8), indicating that studying the Torah is like fashioning it. <b>Rava says: </b> It is <b>as though he fashioned himself, as it is stated: “<i>Va’asitem otam</i>. ” Do not read</b> “<i>va’asitem <b>otam</b></i><b>”</b> as: And you shall fashion them; <b>rather, </b> read it as <i>va’asitem <b>atem</b></i><b>, </b> meaning: You shall fashion yourself. |
| Deuteronomy 29:8 | And it is written: “Observe therefore the words of this covenant” | Sotah 37b:1 | every mitzva contains <b>four</b> aspects. <b>Four</b> general aspects <b>and four</b> specific aspects add up to <b>eight.

| Deuteronomy 29:10 | issued a decree against them, as it is written: “From the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water” | Yevamot 79a:12 | The Talmud returns to the main issue under discussion. As for <b>the Gibeonites, </b> was it <b>David</b> who <b>issued a decree against them</b> that they may not enter the congregation? Wasn’t it <b>Moses</b> who <b>issued a decree against them, as it is written: “From the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:10), which indicates that there was a distinct class of wood hewers and water drawers already in the time of Moses. This class must have been composed of insincere converts who constituted a separate group unto themselves, apart from the rest of the Jewish people. The Talmud answers: <b>Moses issued a decree</b> only <b>with regard to that generation</b> that they must remain separate, whereas <b>David decreed for all generations. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 29:13 | but according to my understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “Neither with you only | Nedarim 25a:7 | The Talmud asks: <b>And still, does</b> a person <b>not commonly take an oath according to his own understanding? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And so we found with regard to Moses our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab, </b> that they accept the Torah upon themselves, <b>he said to them: Know that I do not administer an oath upon you according to your understanding</b> and the stipulations in your hearts <b>but according to my understanding and the understanding of God, as it is stated: “Neither with you only</b> do I make this covenant” (Deuteronomy 29:13). |
| Deuteronomy 29:13 | not according to your understanding that I administer an oath to you, but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. As it is stated: “Neither with you only | Shevuot 39a:8 | This is <b>as we</b> have <b>found</b> written <b>with regard to Moses, our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people</b> in the plains of Moab so that they would accept the Torah upon themselves, <b>he said to them: Know that</b> it is <b>not according to your understanding that I administer an oath to you, but according to the understanding of God and according to my understanding. As it is stated: “Neither with you only</b> do I make this covenant and this oath” (Deuteronomy 29:13), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: Not only according to your intention. |
| Deuteronomy 29:14 | “But with he who stands here | Shevuot 39a:9 | Having quoted a verse, the <i>baraita</i> tangentially interprets the subsequent verse. From the phrase: <b>“But with he who stands here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>those who stood at Mount Sinai</b> were included in this covenant. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>the subsequent generations, and the converts who will convert in the future, </b> were also included? <b>The verse states: “And also with he who is not here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14). |
| Deuteronomy 29:16 | Rabbi Oshaya says: One verse states: “And you have seen their detestable things and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them” | Avodah Zarah51b:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that money, clothing, or vessels found at the head of the idol are not forbidden. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>R' Oshaya says: One verse states: “And you have seen their detestable things and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:16). <b>And one verse states: “You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, </b> nor take it for yourself” (Deuteronomy 7:25). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The second verse mentions the prohibition of only silver and gold, whereas the first verse also mentions wood and stone. |
| Deuteronomy 29:27 | as it is stated: “And He cast them into another land, as it is this day” | Sanhedrin 110b:6 | <strong>Mishnah: </strong> <b>The ten tribes are not destined to return</b> to Eretz Yisrael, even during the messianic era, <b>as it is stated: “And He cast them into another land, as it is this day”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:27). <b>Just as the day passes never to return, so too, </b> the ten tribes <b>go</b> into exile <b>and do not return; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. R' Eliezer says: “As it is this day, ”</b> meaning <b>just as the day darkens and</b> then the sky <b>brightens</b> the next day, with regard to <b>the ten tribes as well, </b> although <b>it is dark for them</b> now, <b>so it is destined to brighten for them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 29:27 | The ten tribes have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation; | Sanhedrin 110b:7 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:12): <b>The ten tribes have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And YHWH rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation; </b> and He cast them into another land, as it is this day” (Deuteronomy 29:27). <b>“And YHWH rooted them out of their land”</b> indicates <b>in this world; “and cast them into another land”</b> indicates <b>for the World-to-Come; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Akiva. R' Shimon ben Yehuda of the village of Akko says in the name of R' Shimon: If their actions</b> continue to be <b>“as it is this day”</b> and they continue to sin, <b>they do not return</b> to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And if not, </b> and they repent, <b>they return</b> to Eretz Yisrael. |
| Deuteronomy 29:28 | “The hidden matters belong to the Lord our God, but those matters that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever [ ad olam ], | Sanhedrin 43b:10 | The Talmud notes that this is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. </b> The verse states: <b>“The hidden matters belong to YHWH our God, but those matters that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever [<i>ad olam</i>], </b> that we may do all the words of this Torah” (Deuteronomy 29:28). <b>Why</b> in a Torah scroll <b>are there dots over</b> each of the letters in the words <b>“to us and to our children” and over the</b> letter <b><i>ayin</i> in</b> the word <b>“forever [<i>ad</i>]”? </b> The dots, which function like erasures that weaken the force of the words, <b>teach that</b> God <b>did not punish</b> the nation <b>for hidden</b> sins <b>until the Jewish people crossed the Jordan</b> River. This is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:3 | So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, the Divine Presence will be with them, as it is stated: “Then the Lord your God will return with your captivity” | Megillah 29a:4 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Come and see how beloved the Jewish people are before God. As every place they were exiled, the Shekhina</b> went <b>with them. They were exiled to Egypt, </b> and <b>the Shekhina</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt? ”</b> (I Samuel 2:27). <b>They were exiled to Babylonia, </b> and <b>the Shekhina</b> went <b>with them, as it is stated: “For your sake I have sent to Babylonia”</b> (Isaiah 43:14). <b>So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, the Shekhina will be with them, as it is stated: “Then YHWH your God will return with your captivity”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:3). <b>It does not state: He will bring back, </b> i.e., He will cause the Jewish people to return, <b>but rather</b> it says: <b>“He will return, ”</b> which <b>teaches that God will return</b> together <b>with them from among the</b> various <b>exiles. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:5 | “And the Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it” | Arakhin 32b:11 | <b>And</b> so it <b>says</b> with regard to the return of the Jews from exile: <b>“And YHWH your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:5). The verse <b>compares your possession to the possession of your fathers: Just as the possession of your fathers</b> came <b>with the renewal of all these matters, </b> i.e., the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee Year, and <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>so too your possession</b> comes <b>with the renewal of all these matters, </b> as the initial consecration was nullified. |
| Deuteronomy 30:5 | that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it” | Niddah 46b:16 | The Talmud asks: <b>And does R' Yosei hold</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in</b> the anthology called <b><i>Seder Olam</i>: </b> The verse that states with regard to the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael following their exile: “And YHWH your God will bring you into the land <b>that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:5). |
| Deuteronomy 30:5 | that your fathers inherited, and you shall inherit it” | Yevamot 82b:2 | <b>As it is taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> in the anthology called <b><i>Seder Olam</i>, </b> with regard to a verse that speaks of the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael following their exile: “And YHWH your God will bring you into the land <b>that your fathers inherited, and you shall inherit it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:5). These two expressions of inheritance teach that <b>they had a first inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua <b>and a second</b> inheritance at the time of the return from the Babylonian exile. That is to say, since the sanctity of the land had lapsed when the First Temple was destroyed and the Jewish people exiled to Babylonia, a second sanctification was necessary when they returned to their land. <b>But they will not have a 3rd</b> inheritance. In other words, it will never be necessary to sanctify the land for a 3rd time, as the second sanctification was permanent. |
| Deuteronomy 30:12 | “It is not in heaven” | Bava Metzia59b:5 | <b>R' Yehoshua stood on his feet and said: </b> It is written: <b>“It is not in heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:12). The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the relevance of the phrase <b>“It is not in heaven”</b> in this context? <b>R' Yirmeya says: </b> Since <b>the Torah was already given at Mount Sinai, we do not regard a bat kol, as You already wrote at Mount Sinai, in the Torah: “After a majority to incline”</b> (Exodus 23:2). Since the majority of Rabbis disagreed with R' Eliezer’s opinion, the <i>halakha</i> is not ruled in accordance with his opinion. The Talmud relates: Years after, <b>R' Natan encountered Elijah</b> the prophet and <b>said to him: What did God do at that time, </b> when R' Yehoshua issued his declaration? Elijah <b>said to him: </b> God, <b>smiled and said: My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:12 | said to them: “It is not in heaven” | Temurah 16a:3 | The Talmud returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Three thousand <i>halakhot</i> were forgotten during the days of mourning for Moses. </b> The Jewish people <b>said to Joshua: Ask</b> for guidance from Heaven so that you can reacquire the forgotten <i>halakhot</i>. Joshua <b>said to them: “It is not in heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:12). Once the Torah was given on Sinai, the rabbis of each generation must determine the <i>halakha</i>. No new <i>halakhot</i> may be added or subtracted by heavenly instruction or through prophecy. |
| Deuteronomy 30:12 | said to them: “It is not in heaven” | Temurah 16a:5 | At the time of Moses’ death, the people <b>said to Pinehas: Ask</b> for halakhic guidance from Heaven so that you can relearn the forgotten <i>halakhot</i>. Pinehas <b>said to them: “It is not in heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:12). The people <b>said to Elazar: Ask</b> for halakhic guidance from God. <b>He said to them</b> that the verse states: <b>“These are the commandments, ”</b> to teach <b>that a prophet is not permitted to introduce any</b> new <b>element from now</b> on. |
| Deuteronomy 30:14 | from here: “But the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it” | Eruvin 54a:11 | <b>R' Yitzḥak said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “But the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:14). <b>When</b> is it <b>very near to you? When it is in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it, </b> i.e., when you articulate your Torah study. |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | “It is your life and the length of your days” | Berakhot 55a:8 | The Talmud details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the <b>Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written</b> of the Torah: <b>“It is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who conducts himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, as R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers, </b> as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? <b>Because he conducted himself with</b> an air of <b>superiority, </b> and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died. |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” | Berakhot 61b:7 | R' Akiva <b>answered him: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared? </b> It is like <b>a fox walking along a riverbank when he sees fish gathering</b> and fleeing <b>from place to place. </b> <b>The fox <b>said to them: From what are you fleeing? </b> <b><b>They said to him: </b> We are fleeing <b>from the nets that people cast upon us. </b> <b><b>He said to them: Do you wish to come up onto dry land, and we will reside together just as my ancestors resided with your ancestors? </b> <b>The fish <b>said to him: You are the one of whom they say, he is the cleverest of animals? You are not clever; you are a fool. If we are afraid in</b> the water, <b>our</b> natural <b>habitat</b> which gives us <b>life, </b> then <b>in a habitat</b> that causes our <b>death, all the more so. </b> <b>The moral is: <b>So too, we</b> Jews, <b>now that we sit and engage in Torah</b> study, <b>about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20), we fear the empire <b>to this extent; if we proceed to</b> sit <b>idle from its</b> study, as its abandonment is the habitat that causes our death, <b>all the more so</b> will we fear the empire. |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | and to cleave to Him” | Ketubot 111b:8 | <b>On a similar note, you say: </b> The verse states: <b>“To love YHWH your God, </b> to hearken to His voice, <b>and to cleave to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>But is it possible for a person to cleave to the Shekhina? Rather, anyone who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and one who conducts business on behalf of Torah scholars, and one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit Torah scholars with his property, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he is cleaving to the Shekhina. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days” | Kiddushin 40a:6 | <b>And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>And R' Abbahu says: </b> This <b>is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the term <b>pursuing</b> written with regard to pursuing peace and the term <b>pursuing</b> written in another verse. <b>It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it, ” and it is written there, </b> with regard to acts of kindness: <b>“Pursues righteousness and kindness. ”</b> This teaches that one who pursues peace will also merit life, prosperity, and honor. <b>With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | “To love the Lord your God, to listen to His voice, and to cleave to Him” | Nedarim 62a:7 | Apropos the story of R' Tarfon’s regret for gaining personal benefit from his status as a Torah scholar, the Talmud cites similar teachings. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“To love YHWH your God, to listen to His voice, and to cleave to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). This verse indicates <b>that a person should not say: I will read</b> the written Torah <b>so that they will call me a Sage; I will study</b> Mishnah <b>so that they will call me R'; I will review</b> my studies <b>so that I will be an Elder and will sit in the academy. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | “For it is your life and the length of your days” | Pesachim 49b:5 | <b>R' Elazar said: It is prohibited to accompany an am ha'aretz</b> while traveling <b>on the road</b> due to concern that the am ha'aretz might try to harm his traveling partner, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Torah: <b>“For it is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). An am ha'aretz has not studied any Torah, indicating that <b>he is not concerned about his own life; </b> with regard <b>to another’s life, all the more so. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 30:20 | It is written in the Torah: “For it is your life and the length of your days” | Shabbat 13a:11 | <b>The</b> Sage in the <b>school of Eliyahu taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that deals with this <i>halakha</i>: There was <b>an incident involving one student who studied much</b> Mishnah <b>and read much</b> Bible, <b>and served Torah scholars</b> extensively, studying Torah from them, <b>and, </b> nevertheless, <b>died at half his days, </b> half his life expectancy. <b>His wife</b> in her bitterness <b>would take his tefillin and go around with them to synagogues and study halls, and she said to</b> the rabbis: <b>It is written in the Torah: “For it is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20).

| Deuteronomy 31:2 | as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in” | Kiddushin 38a:7 | The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>Moses was born on the 7th of Adar? </b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today, ”</b> since Moses could have said simply: I am one hundred and twenty years old. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”? </b> One can learn from it that Moses was born on that date, i.e., he was exactly one hundred and twenty years old. <b>This teaches that God sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26). |
| Deuteronomy 31:2 | “And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today” | Rosh Hashanah11a:12 | The Talmud continues: <b>The one who said</b> that <b>in Nisan</b> the Patriarchs <b>were born</b> also holds that <b>in Nisan they died. The one who says</b> that <b>in Tishrei they were born</b> also holds that <b>in Tishrei they died, as it is stated</b> about Moses on the day of his death: <b>“And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today, ”</b> since it is clear that Moses was speaking on that day, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”? </b> It is to teach that Moses was speaking precisely, as if to say: <b>Today my days and years are</b> exactly <b>filled</b> and completed. This comes <b>to teach you that God sits and fills the years of the righteous from day to day</b> and <b>from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26). Similarly, the Patriarchs merited that their years be fulfilled to the day, and so they died on the same date they were born. |
| Deuteronomy 31:2 | “And he said to them: I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; | Sotah 13b:16 | The verse relates what Moses said to the Jewish people at the end of his life: <b>“And he said to them: I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; </b> I can no longer go out and come in; and YHWH has said to me: You shall not go over this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 31:2). The wording is problematic, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the term <b>“this day. ”</b> Moses said it in order to indicate: On <b>this day, my days and years have been completed</b> to be precisely one hundred and twenty, in order <b>to teach you that God completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is written: “The number of your days I will fill”</b> (Exodus 23:26), indicating that the righteous will live out their years fully. |
| Deuteronomy 31:2 | “I can no longer go out and come in” | Sotah 13b:17 | The verse continues: <b>“I can no longer go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“go out and come in”? If we say</b> it means literally that Moses was <b>actually</b> physically restricted from <b>going out and coming in, but isn’t it written: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, </b> his eye was not dim, <b>nor his natural force abated”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:7), indicating that he was at full physical strength? <b>And it is written</b> further: <b>“And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were twelve steps there</b> to ascend the mountain, <b>and Moses stepped over them</b> all in <b>one step, </b> also indicating that he was at full physical strength. |
| Deuteronomy 31:7 | It is written: “For you shall go | Sanhedrin 8a:7 | Similarly, a distinction is drawn between two verses where Moses commanded Joshua concerning his impending leadership: <b>It is written: “For you shall go</b> with these people into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:7), <b>and it is written: “For you shall bring</b> the children of Israel into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:23). <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> reconciled the difference between these two charges and <b>said: Moses said to Joshua, </b> in the first verse: <b>You and the elders of the generation</b> will enter into Eretz Yisrael together <b>with</b> the people, i.e., the elders will assist you in the leadership. Subsequently, in the second verse, <b>God said to</b> Joshua: You yourself must bring the people: <b>Take a rod and strike</b> the people <b>upon their skulls. </b> There must be <b>one</b> clear and authoritative <b>leader for the generation, and</b> there may <b>not</b> be <b>two</b> or more <b>leaders for the generation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:9 | Rav Mattana said: As the verse states: “And Moses wrote this Torah, and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi” | Gittin 59b:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> The Mishnah teaches that at public readings of the Torah, a priest reads first, and after him a Levite. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source of this <i>halakha</i> in the Torah? <b>Rav Mattana said: As the verse states: “And Moses wrote this Torah, and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:9). The Talmud explains the inference: <b>Is that to say I do not know that the priests are the sons of Levi? </b> Why is it necessary for the verse to say this? <b>Rather, </b> the Torah was first delivered to the priests and afterward to the other Levites, and this serves as the source for the enactment that first <b>a priest</b> reads from the Torah, <b>and after</b> him <b>a Levite. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:10 | in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The verse states: “At the end of every seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the festival of Sukkot ” | Rosh Hashanah12b:11 | It was taught in the Mishnah: <b>Grain and olives</b> are obligated in tithes <b>from</b> the time <b>when they have reached one-3rd</b> of their growth. The Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that the years of produce follow the first 3rd of their growth? <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that this statement was said <b>in the name of R' Yosei HaGelili: The verse states: “At the end of every seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:10). <b>What is the purpose of the Sabbatical Year</b> being mentioned <b>with the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>? </b> The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is already <b>the 8th</b> year. |

At <b>the conclusion of the first day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>on the 8th, </b> after <b>the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year, they make a wooden platform for</b> the king <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and he sits on it, as it is stated: “At the end of every seven years, in the Festival</b> of the Sabbatical Year” (Deuteronomy 31:10). |
| Deuteronomy 31:10 | “at the end | Sotah 41a:22 | The Talmud answers: All of these details <b>are necessary, as, if God had written</b> only <b>“at the end</b> of every seven years” (Deuteronomy 31:10), <b>I would have said</b> that <b>we count from now, </b> i.e., from when this was said, <b>and</b> that the tally of years begins from the fortieth year in the wilderness, <b>even though</b> by this calculation the assembly <b>would not occur in the Sabbatical Year. </b> Therefore, <b>God writes: “The Sabbatical Year. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | “When all of Israel come to appear” | Chagigah 3a:2 | The Talmud explains: <b>With regard to</b> their exemption from the obligation of <b>appearance, </b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of appearance at the Temple on the pilgrim Festival and the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva <b>of assembly, </b> i.e., the obligation to assemble in the Temple on <i>Sukkot</i> in the year following the Sabbatical Year. <b>As it is written, </b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly: <b>“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12), <b>and it is written</b> in that context: <b>“When all of Israel come to appear”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). Just as a deaf person and a mute are not obligated to attend the assembly, they are likewise exempt from appearing in the Temple on the Festivals. |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | in their ears” | Chagigah 3a:8 | <b>R' Tanḥum said: One who is deaf in one ear is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly: “When all Israel comes to appear before YHWH your God in the place that He shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel <b>in their ears”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). This verse indicates that the obligation of assembly applies only to those who can hear with both ears. Since the two mitzvot are connected by verbal analogy, as explained above, this <i>halakha</i> applies to the mitzva of appearance as well. |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | “Before all Israel” | Chagigah 3a:9 | The Talmud asks: <b>But this</b> phrase: <b>“In their ears, ” is necessary</b> to teach that the reading of the Torah at the assembly must enter <b>the ears of the entire Jewish people. </b> Consequently, it cannot serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who is deaf in one ear. The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the reading of the Torah must be heard by the entire Jewish people, <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“Before all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). The Talmud asks: <b>If</b> that <i>halakha</i> were derived <b>from: “Before all Israel, ” I would say</b> that the mitzva applies <b>even though they cannot hear; </b> therefore, <b>God writes: “In their ears, ” and that</b> indicates that <b>they</b> must be able to <b>hear. </b> If so, this phrase is not available for deriving the <i>halakha</i> of someone who is deaf in one ear. |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | assembly | Chagigah 4a:5 | The Talmud answers: This statement <b>was necessary, </b> as otherwise <b>it could enter your mind to say: Let us derive</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term: <b>Appearance, </b> which appears here, and the term: <b>Appearance, </b> stated <b>with</b> regard to the mitzva of <b>assembly</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11), which is also a positive, time-bound mitzva. <b>Just as there, women are obligated</b> in the mitzva of assembly, <b>so too here, women are obligated</b> in the mitzva of appearance on the Festival. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that women are exempt. |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | assembly, | Kiddushin 34b:3 | The Talmud answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to teach the <i>halakha</i> in this case as well, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <b>appearance, </b> where the verse states: Three times in the year all of your males shall appear,” <b>from</b> the <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of <b>assembly, </b> about which the verse states: “When all of Israel come to appear before YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 31:11). One would then say that just as women are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, so too they should be obligated to appear on a pilgrimage Festival. It is therefore necessary for the Torah to state explicitly that women are exempt from the mitzva of appearance on a pilgrimage Festival. |
| Deuteronomy 31:11 | writes: “When all Israel comes” | Sotah 41a:25 | <b>And if God had written</b> only: <b>“In the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, ” I would have said</b> that it could refer <b>even</b> to <b>the last</b> day of the <b>Festival. </b> Therefore, <b>God</b> also <b>writes: “When all Israel comes”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11), |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | is derived from: “That they may hear” | Chagigah 3a:10 | The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the people must hear, <b>is derived from: “That they may hear”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12). Therefore, the phrase: “In their ears,” is not required for that purpose. Rather, it teaches that only those who can hear with both ears are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, and by extension, in the mitzva of appearance as well. |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” | Chagigah 3a:17 | They said to him that R' Elazar ben Azarya interpreted the following verse: <b>“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12). This verse is puzzling: <b>If men come to learn, </b> and <b>women, </b> who might not understand, <b>come</b> at least <b>to hear, why do the little ones come? </b> They come <b>in order</b> for God to <b>give a reward to those who bring them, </b> i.e., God credits those who bring their children to the assembly. R' Yehoshua <b>said to them: </b> This <b>good pearl</b> of wisdom <b>was in your hands, and you tried to conceal it from me? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” | Chagigah 3a:2 | The Talmud explains: <b>With regard to</b> their exemption from the obligation of <b>appearance, </b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of appearance at the Temple on the pilgrim Festival and the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva <b>of assembly, </b> i.e., the obligation to assemble in the Temple on <i>Sukkot</i> in the year following the Sabbatical Year. <b>As it is written, </b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly: <b>“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12), <b>and it is written</b> in that context: <b>“When all of Israel come to appear”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). Just as a deaf person and a mute are not obligated to attend the assembly, they are likewise exempt from appearing in the Temple on the Festivals. |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | “That they may hear, and that they may learn” | Chagigah 3a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>And there, </b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly, <b>from where do we</b> derive that a deaf person and a mute are exempt? <b>As it is written</b> there: <b>“That they may hear, and that they may learn”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“that they may hear” excludes one who speaks but does not hear; </b> and the phrase <b>“and that they may learn” excludes one who hears but does not speak, </b> as he is unable to learn. |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | That they may teach [ yelamdu ], | Chagigah 3a:6 | <b>Mar Zutra said</b> that one should <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>That they may teach [<i>yelamdu</i>], </b> instead of: “That they may learn [<i>yilmedu</i>]” (Deuteronomy 31:12). Even if a mute person is able to learn he cannot teach others. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the verse <b>is certainly</b> to be read: <b>That they may teach. As, if it enters your mind</b> that one should read: <b>“That they may learn, ”</b> as it is written, <b>and</b> you will explain that <b>since he is not</b> able to <b>speak he</b> is <b>not</b> able to <b>learn, </b> and similarly the reason for the exemption of a deaf person is that <b>since he is not</b> able to <b>hear he is not</b> able to <b>learn, </b> you will have erred. According to this interpretation, it is clear from the context that a deaf person is exempted by the phrase: “That they may hear,” not merely due to his lack of hearing but because his inability to hear prevents him from learning. |
| Deuteronomy 31:12 | children are obligated | Kiddushin 34b:10 | <b>But let God write</b> that women are obligated in eating <b><i>matza</i>, and it</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>necessary</b> to state the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>assembly, and I</b> would <b>say</b> on my own: If <b>children are obligated</b> in assembly, as is stated explicitly in the verse “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the children” (Deuteronomy 31:12), are <b>women not all the more so</b> obligated? <b>Therefore, </b> as it is explicitly stated that women are obligated in assembly, the verses concerning <i>matza</i> and assembly are <b>two verses that come as one, and</b> consequently do <b>not teach</b> a precedent. |
| Deuteronomy 31:14 | “Behold, your days approach that you must die” | Moed Katan28a:7 | <b>R' Ḥanin said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is stated: <b>“Behold, your days approach that you must die”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:14). This verse is expounded in the following manner: <b>“Behold [<i>hen</i>]”</b> indicates <b>one; “approach [<i>karvu</i>], ”</b> a plural term, indicates <b>two; “your days [<i>yamekha</i>], ”</b> also a plural term, indicates another <b>two; </b> and therefore in total <b>this is five. </b> How does the word <b><i>hen</i></b> indicate <b>one? Because in the Greek language they call</b> the number <b>one <i>hen</i>. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:14 | “And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting” | Sotah 13b:19 | The verse discussing when Joshua was appointed to be the successor of Moses states: <b>“And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:14). A Sage <b>taught: That Sabbath</b> when Moses died <b>was</b> a day <b>of two pairs [<i>deyo zugei</i>], </b> i.e., two wise men, Moses and Joshua, serving together in one place. <b>Authority was taken from one and given to the other. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:16 | from this verse, as it is stated: “And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise; this people will go astray” | Sanhedrin 90b:14 | <b>The Romans asked R' Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: From where</b> is it derived <b>that God revives the dead, and</b> from where is it derived that <b>He knows what is destined to be? </b> R' Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to them: Both of those</b> matters are derived <b>from this verse, as it is stated: “And YHWH said to Moses, Behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise; this people will go astray”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:16). This indicates that Moses will die and then arise from the dead and that God knows what the children of Israel are destined to do. |
| Deuteronomy 31:16 | as it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise” | Sanhedrin 90b:9 | The proof <b>from the Torah</b> is <b>as it is written: “And YHWH said to Moses, behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:16). The heretics <b>said to him: But perhaps</b> the verse should be divided in a different manner, and it should be read: “Behold, you shall lie with your fathers, <b>and this people will arise and stray</b> after the foreign gods of the land. ” |
| Deuteronomy 31:16 | “ Vekam ” | Yoma 52b:5 | Finally, the term: <b>“<i>Vekam</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:16) can be read as: “Behold, you are about to sleep with your fathers and rise up [<i>vekam</i>]” at the time of the resurrection of the dead; or: “And this people will rise up [<i>vekam</i>] and go astray. ” |
| Deuteronomy 31:17 | “Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, | Chagigah 5a:18 | On the same topic the Talmud states: <b>“Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, </b> and they shall be devoured” (Deuteronomy 31:17). <b>Rav Bardela bar Tavyumei said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who is not subject to</b> His <b>hiding of the face, </b> i.e., whose prayers are invariably answered, <b>is not from</b> the Jewish people, as the verse states about the Jewish people that God will hide His face from them as a result of their sins. Similarly, <b>anyone</b> who <b>is not subject to: “And they shall be devoured, ”</b> i.e., non-Jews do not steal his money, |
| Deuteronomy 31:18 | “And I will hide my face in that day” | Chagigah 5b:2 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And I will hide my face in that day”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:18), <b>Rava said</b> that <b>God said: Even though I hid my face from them</b> and My Shekhina is not revealed, nevertheless: <b>“I speak with him in a dream”</b> (Numbers 12:6). <b>Rav Yosef said: His hand is outstretched, </b> guarding <b>over us, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of my hand”</b> (Isaiah 51:16). |
| Deuteronomy 31:19 | and teach it to the children of Israel; | Eruvin 54b:14 | <b>R' Akiva says: From where</b> do we derive <b>that a person is obligated to teach his student until he learns</b> the material and understands it? <b>As it is stated: </b> “Now therefore write this song for you, <b>and teach it to the children of Israel; </b> put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). This verse indicates that one must teach Torah to others. <b>And from where</b> do we derive that one must teach his students <b>until</b> the material <b>is organized in their mouths? As it is stated: “Put it in their mouths, ”</b> so that they should be capable of teaching it to others. |
| Deuteronomy 31:19 | “Now therefore write this song for you, | Nedarim 38a:6 | The Talmud cites an additional verse: <b>“Now therefore write this song for you, </b> and teach it the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). Apparently, Moses was commanded to teach the Torah to the Jewish people. The Talmud answers: The verse is referring to <b>the song</b> of <i>Ha’azinu</i> (Deuteronomy 31) <b>alone</b> and not to the rest of the Torah. The Talmud asks: But the continuation of that cited verse: <b>“That this song may be a witness for Me among the children of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:19), indicates that the reference is to the entire Torah, in which the mitzvot are written. Rather, the Torah was given from the outset to all of the Jewish people, and when R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, said that the Torah was given exclusively to Moses, he was referring <b>merely</b> to the <b>profound analysis</b> of the Torah. Moses opted to teach it to the people on his own initiative. |
| Deuteronomy 31:19 | song | Sanhedrin 21b:19 | <b>Rava says: </b> With regard to the mitzva for every Jew to write himself a Torah scroll, <b>even if a person’s ancestors left him a Torah scroll, </b> it is <b>a mitzva to write</b> a scroll <b>of one’s own, as it is stated: “Now, therefore, write for yourselves</b> this <b>song</b> and teach it to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). <b>Abaye raised an objection to him</b> from a <i>baraita</i> concerning the king’s Torah scroll: <b>And he writes himself a Torah scroll for his sake, so that he does not beautify himself with</b> the Torah scroll <b>of others. </b> Read precisely, this indicates that <b>a king, yes, </b> he is included in the <i>halakha</i> not to have a scroll inherited from his ancestors suffice, but <b>an ordinary</b> person is <b>not. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:20 | from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn | Berakhot 32a:12 | On a similar note, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say</b> in a popular maxim: <b>Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me”</b> (Hosea 13:6). <b>Rav Naḥman said: </b> This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but <b>from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:14). <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn</b> to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20). |
| Deuteronomy 31:21 | when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “Then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them” | Chagigah 5a:15 | Additionally, <b>when R' Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “Then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:21). He said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master brings upon him evils and troubles, is there a remedy for him? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:21 | for it shall not be forgotten from his seed” | Shabbat 138b:17 | An opposing view <b>was taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>. <b>R' Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Heaven forfend that the Torah should be forgotten from the Jewish people, as it is stated: </b> “And this song shall answer to him as a witness, <b>for it shall not be forgotten from his seed”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:21). <b>Rather, how do I explain: “They will roam to find the word of God, but they will not find it”? </b> It means <b>that they will not find</b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:23 | and it is written: “For you shall bring | Sanhedrin 8a:7 | Similarly, a distinction is drawn between two verses where Moses commanded Joshua concerning his impending leadership: <b>It is written: “For you shall go</b> with these people into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:7), <b>and it is written: “For you shall bring</b> the children of Israel into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:23). <b>R' Yoḥanan</b> reconciled the difference between these two charges and <b>said: Moses said to Joshua, </b> in the first verse: <b>You and the elders of the generation</b> will enter into Eretz Yisrael together <b>with</b> the people, i.e., the elders will assist you in the leadership. Subsequently, in the second verse, <b>God said to</b> Joshua: You yourself must bring the people: <b>Take a rod and strike</b> the people <b>upon their skulls. </b> There must be <b>one</b> clear and authoritative <b>leader for the generation, and</b> there may <b>not</b> be <b>two</b> or more <b>leaders for the generation. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 31:26 | lay the Torah scroll, as it is stated: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord” | Bava Batra14a:14 | <b>And the chest in which the Philistines sent the gift to the God of Israel was placed alongside</b> the Ark, <b>as it is stated: “And put the golden devices which you are restoring to Him for a guilt-offering in a chest by the side of it, and send it away that it may go”</b> (I Samuel 6:8). <b>And upon</b> this chest <b>lay the Torah scroll, as it is stated: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26). This means that <b>it was placed at the side</b> of the Ark, <b>and not inside</b> it. |
| Deuteronomy 31:26 | at the side of the Ark” | Bava Batra14b:3 | Having concluded its current discussion, the Talmud now addresses the details of the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>R' Yehuda, </b> who says that the Torah scroll rested on the chest that came from the Philistines, <b>where was the Torah scroll placed before the chest arrived? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>A shelf protruded from</b> the Ark <b>and the Torah scroll rested on it. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>R' Meir, </b> who says that the Torah scroll rested inside the Ark, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: “Take this Torah scroll and put it <b>at the side of the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26)? The Talmud answers: <b>He requires</b> that verse to teach <b>that</b> the Torah scroll <b>was placed at the side</b> of the tablets, <b>and that it was not placed between</b> the two <b>tablets, but</b> it was <b>actually</b> placed <b>inside</b> the Ark <b>at the side</b> of the tablets. |
| Deuteronomy 31:26 | Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll” | Bava Batra15a:5 | <b>R' Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <b>Rather, until this point God dictated and Moses repeated</b> after Him <b>and wrote</b> the text. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, </b> with respect to Moses’ death, <b>God dictated and Moses wrote with tears. </b> The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <b>later, as it is stated</b> concerning the writing of the Prophets: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18). |
| Deuteronomy 31:26 | as it is stated: “Take this scroll of the Torah” | Gittin 60a:14 | The Talmud returns to discuss the previously mentioned dispute. <b>R' Yoḥanan says in the name of R' Bana’a: The Torah was given</b> from the outset <b>scroll by scroll, as it is stated: “Then I said, behold, I come with the scroll of the book that is written for me”</b> (Psalms 40:8). King David is saying about himself that there is a section of the Torah, “the scroll of the book,” that alludes to him, i.e., “that is written for me. ” This indicates that each portion of the Torah constitutes a separate scroll. <b>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: The Torah was given</b> as <b>a complete</b> book, <b>as it is stated: “Take this scroll of the Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), which teaches that from the outset the Torah was given as a complete unit. |
| Deuteronomy 31:26 | “Take this Torah scroll and put it | Menachot 30a:7 | <b>R' Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll</b> was <b>missing a single letter? But it is written</b> that God instructed Moses: <b>“Take this Torah scroll and put it</b> by the side of the Ark of the Covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. |
| Deuteronomy 32:1 | hei , zayin , yod , vav , lamed , kaf . | Rosh Hashanah31a:9 | § The Talmud further asks: When it came <b>to the additional offerings of Shabbat, what would</b> the Levites <b>recite? Rav Anan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b> They would recite in accordance with the mnemonic <b><i>hei</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>kaf</i>. </b> They would divide the song of <i>Ha’azinu</i> into six sections, each of which began with a letter of the mnemonic: “Give ear [<i>ha’azinu</i>], you heavens” (Deuteronomy 32:1); “Remember [<i>zekhor</i>] the days of old” (Deuteronomy 32:7); “He made him ride [<i>yarkivehu</i>] on the high places of the earth” (Deuteronomy 32:13); “YHWH saw it [<i>vayar</i>] and spurned” (Deuteronomy 32:19); “Were it not [<i>lulei</i>] that I dread the enemy’s provocation” (Deuteronomy 32:27); “For <i>[ki]</i> YHWH will judge His people” (Deuteronomy 32:36). |
| Deuteronomy 32:2 | which is written: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, | Bava Batra25a:12 | The Talmud cites a statement connected to the four winds. <b>Rav Yehuda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, </b> my speech shall distill as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender growth, and as the showers upon the herb” (Deuteronomy 32:2)? “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain”; <b>this is the western wind, which comes from the back of [<i>me’orpo</i>] the world, </b> as the west is also referred to as the back. |
| Deuteronomy 32:2 | the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine [ likḥi ] shall drop as the rain” | Taanit 7a:3 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said: The day of the rains is as great as the day</b> on which <b>the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine [<i>likḥi</i>] shall drop as the rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:2), <b>and <i>lekaḥ</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “For I give you good doctrine [<i>lekaḥ</i>]; do not forsake My Torah”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). <b>Rava said: </b> Rainfall is even <b>greater than the day on which the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain, ”</b> and when one makes a comparison, <b>which</b> object <b>is</b> made <b>dependent upon which? You must say</b> that <b>the lesser</b> object <b>is dependent upon the greater</b> one. If Torah is compared to rain, it follows that rain is greater than Torah. |
| Deuteronomy 32:3 | As it is stated: “When I proclaim the Lord’s name, give glory to our God” | Berakhot 21a:4 | And <b>from where is</b> the mitzva <b>by Torah law</b> to recite <b>the blessing over the Torah before it</b> is read, derived? <b>As it is stated: “When I proclaim YHWH’s name, give glory to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3), meaning that before one proclaims YHWH’s name by reading the Torah, he must give glory to God. |
| Deuteronomy 32:3 | praise to our God” | Berakhot 45a:6 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> With regard to the basic mitzva of <i>zimmun</i>, the Talmud asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived<b>, </b> that after a meal in which three diners participated, a <i>zimmun</i> must be recited? <b>Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together”</b> (Psalms 34:4), i.e., the one reciting the blessing turns to at least two others to praise God together. <b>R' Abbahu said: </b> The source of the mitzva of <i>zimmun</i> is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “When I call the Name of YHWH, give</b> [plural] <b>praise to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). |
| Deuteronomy 32:3 | “When I call out the name of the Lord, give glory to our God” | Yoma 37a:3 | § The Mishnah continues: <b>And</b> the priests and the people who were in the courtyard <b>respond after he</b> recites the name of God: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“When I call out the name of YHWH, give glory to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: When I mention the name of God you give</b> Him <b>glory</b> and recite praises in his honor. <b>Ḥananya, son of the brother of R' Yehoshua, says</b> that proof for the practice is from a different source: <b>“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7). <b>The prophet, </b> Solomon, <b>said to the Jewish people: When I mention the Righteous One of all worlds, you accord Him a blessing. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:4 | said: “The Rock, His work is perfect; | Avodah Zarah18a:5 | The Talmud relates: <b>When the three of them went out</b> after being sentenced, <b>they accepted the</b> justice of God’s <b>judgment. </b> R' Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>said: “The Rock, His work is perfect; </b> for all His ways are justice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). <b>And his wife said</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“A God of faithfulness and without iniquity. ” His daughter said: “Great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways</b> of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways” (Jeremiah 32:19). <b>R'</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: How great are these righteous people, that</b> these <b>three verses, </b> which speak <b>of</b> the <b>acceptance of</b> God’s <b>judgment, occurred to them at the time of accepting the</b> righteousness of His <b>judgment. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:4 | his life will be relinquished [ yivatru ], as it is stated: “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice” | Bava Kamma50a:23 | <b>R' Ḥanina says: Anyone who states</b> that <b>God is forgiving [<i>vateran</i>]</b> of transgressions, <b>his life will be relinquished [<i>yivatru</i>], as it is stated: “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:4). In other words, God does not waive heavenly justice. <b>R' Ḥana says, and some say</b> that <b>R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> says: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:4 | “A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, | Taanit 11a:11 | The <i>baraita</i> cites another verse that deals with judgment. <b>“A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, </b> He is just and righteous” (Deuteronomy 32:4). The <i>baraita</i> interprets <b>“a God of faithfulness”</b> to mean that <b>just as punishment is exacted from the wicked in the World-to-Come even for a light transgression that they commit, so too, punishment is exacted from the righteous in this world for a light transgression that they commit. </b> The righteous suffer their punishment in this world to purify them so they can enjoy the World-to-Come. |

The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you, </b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 32:6 | a tereifa , as it is written: “Has He not made you, and established you?” | Chullin 56b:13 | § The Mishnah states: If the bird’s <b>intestines emerged</b> from the stomach wall but were not perforated, the bird is kosher. <b>R' Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: </b> The rabbis <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one did not jumble them, </b> but returned them to the stomach in their proper order. <b>But</b> if <b>he jumbled them, </b> the bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, as it is written: “Has He not made you, and established you? ”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:6). The verse <b>teaches that God created established</b> locations for each organ <b>in a person, </b> so <b>that if one of them is switched he cannot live. </b> The same applies to other creatures. |
| Deuteronomy 32:6 | none other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you, | Sanhedrin 102a:11 | <b>R' Ḥanina bar Pappa says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who derives benefit from this world without</b> reciting <b>a blessing, it is as though he stole from God and the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a corrupter”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his father”</b> is referring to <b>none other than God as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you, </b> Who made you and established you? ” (Deuteronomy 32:6). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his mother”</b> is referring to <b>none other than the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8).

| Deuteronomy 32:7 | “Ask your father, and he will declare unto you, your Elders, and they will tell you” | Shabbat 23a:7 | And <b>what blessing</b> does one <b>recite?

The Talmud answers that <b>Rav Avya said: </b> The obligation to recite this blessing is derived <b>from</b> the verse: “<b>You shall not turn aside</b> from the sentence which they shall declare unto you, to the right, nor to the left” (Deuteronomy 17:11). From this verse, the mitzva incumbent upon all of Israel to heed the statements and decrees of the rabbis is derived. Therefore, one who fulfills their directives fulfills a divine commandment. <b>Rav Neḥemya said</b> that the mitzva to heed the voice of the Elders of Israel is derived from the verse: <b>“Ask your father, and he will declare unto you, your Elders, and they will tell you”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:7). |
| Deuteronomy 32:7 | “Ask your father, and he will declare unto you, | Sukkah 46a:9 | The Talmud asks: And <b>what</b> is the first <b>blessing</b> that one <b>recites? </b> He recites: <b>Blessed…Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and has commanded us to light the Hanukkah light. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And where did He command us? </b> The mitzva of Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Torah, so how can one say that it was commanded to us by God?

Just as the children of Israel, i.e., the sons of Jacob, are twelve in number, so does the world rest on twelve pillars. <b>And some say: </b> There are <b>seven pillars, as it is stated: “She has hewn out her seven pillars”</b> (Proverbs 9:1). <b>R' Elazar ben Shammua says: </b> The earth rests <b>on one pillar and a righteous person is its name, as it is stated: “But a righteous person is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). |
| Deuteronomy 32:13 | honey, as it is stated: “And He would suckle them with honey from a crag and oil | Sotah 11b:7 | <b>And God would send from the heavens above</b> an angel <b>who would clean and prepare</b> the newborns, <b>just as a midwife prepares the newborn, as it is stated: “And as for your birth, on the day you were born, your navel was not cut nor were you washed with water for cleansing; </b> you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all” (Ezekiel 16:4). This indicates that there were no midwives to take care of the Jews born in Egypt. <b>And</b> then, the angel <b>would gather for them two round</b> stones from the field and the babies would nurse from that which would flow out of them. <b>One of</b> the stones flowed with <b>oil and one of</b> the stones flowed with <b>honey, as it is stated: “And He would suckle them with honey from a crag and oil</b> from a flinty rock” (Deuteronomy 32:13). |
| Deuteronomy 32:14 | “With the kidney-fat of wheat” | Ketubot 111b:13 | It is stated: <b>“With the kidney-fat of wheat”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14). The rabbis <b>said: In the future, </b> each and every kernel of <b>wheat will be as</b> big as <b>the two kidneys of the large ox.

The rabbis <b>said: The World-to-Come is not like this world. </b> In <b>this world there is suffering</b> involved <b>in picking</b> grapes <b>and</b> in <b>pressing</b> them.

| Deuteronomy 32:18 | And Rock means nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Of the Rock that gave birth to you, you have been unmindful, | Berakhot 5b:26 | <b>Not only that, but it causes the Shekhina to remove itself from Israel, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“The Rock will be moved from its place. ”</b> The rock, God, is forced to remove His presence. <b>And Rock means nothing other than God as it is stated: “Of the Rock that gave birth to you, you have been unmindful, </b> and you have forgotten God Who bore you” (Deuteronomy 32:18). |

He began and said: “And the Lord saw it and He abhorred them, due to the provocation of His sons and His daughters” | Ketubot 8b:4 | § This is <b>similar</b> to <b>that</b> incident <b>involving Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba, who was the Bible teacher of the sons of Reish Lakish, and some say</b> that he was <b>the Mishnah teacher of the son of Reish Lakish. His child died. On the first day, </b> Reish Lakish <b>did not go to</b> comfort <b>him. The next day, he took Yehuda bar Naḥmani, his disseminator, </b> with him to comfort Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba. Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> his disseminator: <b>Stand and say a matter</b> of comfort <b>with regard to</b> the death of <b>the child. He began and said: “And YHWH saw it and He abhorred them, due to the provocation of His sons and His daughters”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:19). <b>A generation in which the fathers abhor God He is angered at their sons and their daughters, and they die when they are small. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:20 | states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness” | Kiddushin 36a:12 | <b>And R' Meir says: Either way you are</b> still <b>called sons, as it is stated: “They are foolish sons”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22). <b>And it</b> also <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:20). <b>And it states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly”</b> (Isaiah 1:4). <b>And it states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God”</b> (Hosea 2:1). |
| Deuteronomy 32:20 | learn from this that he is a wicked person, as it is stated: “For they are a generation [ ki dor ] of upheavals” | Yoma 83b:12 | § <b>And furthermore, </b> it is told: <b>R' Meir and R' Yehuda and R' Yosei were walking on the road</b> together. <b>R' Meir would analyze names</b> and discern one’s nature from his name, while <b>R' Yehuda and R' Yosei were not</b> apt to <b>analyze names.

Since it was Friday afternoon, <b>R' Yehuda and R' Yosei entrusted their purses to him.

| Deuteronomy 32:21 | “I will provoke them with a vile nation” | Yevamot 63b:8 | With regard to the verse: <b>“Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:32), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is</b> a reference to the children’s <b>father’s wife, </b> their stepmother. With regard to the verse: <b>“I will provoke them with a vile nation”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:21), <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is a bad wife whose marriage contract is large. R' Eliezer says</b> that <b>these are apostates, and so too</b> the verse <b>states: “The vile man has said in his heart: There is no God, </b> they have dealt corruptly” (Psalms 14:1), which proves that an apostate is called vile. |
| Deuteronomy 32:23 | I will consume My arrows upon them” | Sotah 9a:11 | <b>Ameimar teaches that</b> statement <b>of Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa with regard to this: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For I YHWH change not; and you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed”</b> (Malachi 3:6)? <b>“For I YHWH change [<i>shaniti</i>] not”</b> is interpreted to mean: <b>I did not strike a nation and repeat [<i>shaniti</i>]</b> striking <b>it, </b> as a stricken nation never recovers from the initial strike. <b>“And you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed, ”</b> is interpreted to mean: Despite the fact that I strike you many times for your sins, I do not let you perish. <b>This is</b> the same <b>as that which is written: </b> “I will heap evils upon them; <b>I will consume My arrows upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:23), which is interpreted to mean: <b>My arrows are consumed</b> and used up, <b>and they, </b> the Jewish people, <b>are not consumed</b> but will continue to endure despite the many calamities that will befall them. |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | it connotes Eating, as it is written: “And the teeth of animals I will send forth against them” | Bava Kamma3a:11 | The Talmud suggests: <b>And let God write</b> only the first phrase, <b>“and he sends forth, ” and there would be no need</b> to write the second phrase, <b>“and it consumed, ” as</b> the phrase “and he sends forth” <b>connotes Trampling and connotes Eating. It connotes Trampling, as it is written: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20), and <b>it connotes Eating, as it is written: “And the teeth of animals I will send forth against them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24). |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [ reshef ] and bitter destruction [ ketev meriri ], | Berakhot 5a:5 | <b>And R' Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> upon his bed, demons stay away from him. </b> This is alluded to, <b>as it is stated: </b> “But man is born into trouble, <b>and the sparks [<i>reshef</i> ] fly [<i>uf</i> ] upward”</b> (Job 5:7). The verse is explained: The word <b>fly [<i>uf</i> ]</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, </b> as Torah is difficult to grasp and easy to lose, like something that floats away, <b>as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone; </b> for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies into the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5). The word <b>“sparks”</b> means <b>nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [<i>reshef</i>] and bitter destruction [<i>ketev meriri</i>], </b> and the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust” (Deuteronomy 32:24). Here we see <i>reshef</i> listed along with <i>ketev meriri</i>, both of which are understood by the rabbis to be names of demons. |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | the dust” | Eruvin 63a:20 | The Talmud continues to discuss the same topic. <b>R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence is deserving of being bitten by a snake, as it is stated: “And Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, </b> and you are very old; <b>therefore I held back</b> [<b><i>zaḥalti</i></b>] and I was afraid, and did not declare my opinion to you” (Job 32:6), <b>and it is written: “With the venom of the crawling things of</b> [<b><i>zoḥalei</i></b>] <b>the dust”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24), which refers to snakes. Elihu’s statement is understood as follows: I must apologize for speaking in my teacher’s presence, for one who does so is liable to be punished with the bite of a snake. |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | ketev meriri , | Pesachim 111b:8 | The Talmud discusses the <b><i>ketev meriri</i>, </b> a demon mentioned in the Torah (Deuteronomy 32:24). <b>There are two</b> types <b>of <i>ketev</i></b> demons, <b>one</b> that comes <b>before noon</b> in the morning <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> comes <b>in the afternoon. </b> The one <b>that</b> comes <b>before noon is called <i>ketev meriri</i>, and it appears in a jug of <i>kutaḥ</i>, </b> a Babylonian spice, and continuously <b>revolves around inside it. </b> The <i>ketev</i> <b>in the afternoon is called <i>ketev yashud tzaharayim</i></b> (Psalms 91:6), <b>and it appears inside the horn of a goat and revolves around inside it like a sifter. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:24 | and it is written there: “With the poison of crawling things [ zoḥalei ] of the dust” | Sanhedrin 110a:8 | Apropos the prohibition of perpetuating a dispute, <b>R' Yosei says: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who disputes the reign of the house of David, it is fitting for a snake to bite him. </b> As <b>it is written here: “And Adonijah slaughtered sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth”</b> (I Kings 1:9); <b>and it is written there: “With the poison of crawling things [<i>zoḥalei</i>] of the dust”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24). Adonijah, who rebelled against his father, King David, was fit to be bitten by a snake. |
| Deuteronomy 32:25 | And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror” | Bava Kamma60b:2 | § <b>A baraita states: </b> If there is <b>plague in the city, gather your feet, </b> i.e., limit the time you spend out of the house, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning. ” And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you; </b> hide yourself for a little moment, until the anger has passed by” (Isaiah 26:20). <b>And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:25). |
| Deuteronomy 32:30 | as it is written: “How should one man chase a thousand” | Moed Katan16b:27 | The expression: <b>“Against eight hundred people, which he slew at one time, ”</b> means <b>that he would throw an arrow</b> in the air <b>and</b> with it <b>kill eight hundred people at one time. And</b> David <b>would sigh over the two hundred</b> who were missing from fulfillment of the Torah’s promise, <b>as it is written: “How should one man chase a thousand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:30). |
| Deuteronomy 32:32 | “Their grapes are grapes of gall, | Berakhot 56b:10 | Similarly, <b>one who sees grapes in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: </b> “I found Israel <b>like grapes in the wilderness”</b> (Hosea 9:10), <b>before a different verse, </b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Their grapes are grapes of gall, </b> their clusters are bitter” (Deuteronomy 32:32). <b>One who sees a mountain in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger</b> of good tidings, that announces peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announces salvation” (Isaiah 52:7), <b>before a different verse, </b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing”</b> (Jeremiah 9:9). |
| Deuteronomy 32:35 | is not mistaken, as it is written: “For the day of their calamity [ eidam ] is at hand” | Avodah Zarah2a:3 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>The one who teaches <i>eideihen</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> <b>is not mistaken, as it is written: “For the day of their calamity [<i>eidam</i>] is at hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:35), and the future downfall mentioned in the verse is partly due to the festivals of idol worshippers. The term there is spelled with an <i>alef</i>. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>the one who teaches <i>eideihen</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> <b>is not mistaken, as it is written: “Let them bring their witnesses [<i>eideihem</i>], that they may be justified”</b> (Isaiah 43:9), i.e., the festivals will serve as witnesses against non-Jew sinners, proving that they engaged in idol worship. The term there is spelled with an <i>ayin</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 32:36 | when He sees that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left” | Sanhedrin 97a:10 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“For YHWH shall judge His people</b> and atone for His servants, <b>when He sees that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:36). From the phrase “their power is gone” it is derived that <b>the son of David will not come until informers will proliferate. Alternatively, </b> the Messiah will not come <b>until the</b> number of <b>students</b> of Torah <b>diminishes. Alternatively, </b> the Messiah will not come <b>until</b> the <b><i>peruta</i> will cease from the purse. Alternatively, </b> the Messiah will not come <b>until they despair from the redemption, as it is stated: “And there is none shut up or left, ” as though there were no supporter or helper for the Jewish people. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:37 | “And he shall say: Where is their God, their rock in whom they trusted?” | Gittin 56b:8 | § Vespasian <b>went</b> back to Rome and <b>sent Titus</b> in his place. The Talmud cites a verse that was expounded as referring to Titus: <b>“And he shall say: Where is their God, their rock in whom they trusted? ”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:37). <b>This is the wicked Titus, who insulted and blasphemed God on High. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:38 | the verse states: “Who did eat the fat of their offerings, and drank the wine of their drink-offering” | Avodah Zarah29b:10 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>wine</b> belonging to non-Jews is prohibited? <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>the verse states: “Who did eat the fat of their offerings, and drank the wine of their drink-offering”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:38). This verse juxtaposes the fat of non-Jew sacrifices to their wine: <b>Just as</b> deriving <b>benefit from</b> their <b>offering is prohibited, so too, </b> deriving <b>benefit from</b> their <b>wine</b> is <b>prohibited. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:38 | and drink the wine of their libations” | Pesachim 22a:10 | The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> that blood is meant to be <b>like water poured before idolatry, </b> from which one may not benefit. The Talmud rejects this: <b>There, </b> that <b>is also called a libation</b> and not pouring, <b>as it is written: </b> “Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices, <b>and drink the wine of their libations”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:38). |
| Deuteronomy 32:39 | It is written: “I put to death and I make live” | Pesachim 68a:18 | <b>Rava raised a contradiction</b> between two parts of a verse. <b>It is written: “I put to death and I make live”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:39) <b>and</b> in that same verse <b>it is written: “I wound and I heal. ” Now</b> once it says that <b>He gives life</b> to the dead, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that <b>He</b> can <b>heal</b> those who are still alive? What then does the second clause add to the first? <b>Rather, </b> the second clause clarifies the first one: <b>God said: Those</b> same people <b>whom I put to death I will bring to life, just as</b> those people <b>whom I wounded I will heal. </b> In other words, the verse means to say that just as God will heal the same people He wounded, so will He revive those He put to death; and not, as the verse might otherwise have been understood, that He puts some people to death and gives life to others. |
| Deuteronomy 32:39 | the father does not confer merit upon the son, as it is written: “None delivers from My hand” | Sanhedrin 104a:7 | The Talmud continues and asks: <b>For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>not enumerate</b> the wicked <b>Amon</b> among the kings with no share in the World-to-Come? The Talmud answers: He is not enumerated <b>due to the honor of Josiah, </b> his righteous son. The Talmud challenges: <b>Let us also not enumerate Manasseh due to the honor of Hezekiah, </b> his righteous father. The Talmud explains: <b>The son confers merit upon the father, </b> as it is to the father’s credit that he raised a righteous son; but <b>the father does not confer merit upon the son, as it is written: “None delivers from My hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:39). <b>Abraham does not deliver</b> his son <b>Ishmael</b> from the judgment of Heaven; <b>Isaac does not deliver</b> his son <b>Esau</b> from judgment. The Talmud comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> understanding, <b>Ahaz too was not enumerated</b> in the Mishnah <b>due to the honor of</b> his son <b>Hezekiah. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:39 | Rava raises a contradiction. It is written: “I will kill and I will bring to life” | Sanhedrin 91b:12 | <b>Rava raises a contradiction. It is written: “I will kill and I will bring to life”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:39), indicating that God is capable of reviving the dead. <b>And it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“I wounded and I will heal, ”</b> which indicates that God will only heal the wounded. Rather, it should be understood: <b>God is saying: What I kill, I bring to life, </b> indicating that God revives the dead. <b>And then what I wounded, I will heal. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 32:43 | and atones for the land of [ admato ] His people” | Ketubot 111a:9 | <b>Rav Anan said: Anyone who is buried in Eretz Yisrael</b> is considered <b>as though</b> he is <b>buried beneath the altar. It is stated here: “An altar of earth [<i>adama</i>] you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21), <b>and it is stated there: </b> “For He does avenge the blood of His servants, and renders vengeance to His adversaries, <b>and atones for the land of [<i>admato</i>] His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:43). This teaches that one who is buried in the earth of Eretz Yisrael is considered as though he is buried beneath the altar in the Temple. |
| Deuteronomy 32:47 | what is his reward? Rabbi Abbahu said: Of him the verse says: “And it is through this matter that you will prolong your days” | Berakhot 24b:21 | The Talmud asks: <b>And if he stopped</b> his recitation, <b>what is his reward? R' Abbahu said: Of him the verse says: “And it is through this matter that you will prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:47), meaning that by being careful with one’s speech one merits longevity. |
| Deuteronomy 33:1 | does not know where he is buried. It is written here: “And no man knows of his grave,” and it is written there: “And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed | Sotah 14a:2 | <b>R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says: Even Moses our teacher</b> himself <b>does not know where he is buried. It is written here: “And no man knows of his grave, ” and it is written there: “And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed</b> the children of Israel before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1). In other words, even Moses, as he is referred to by the term “man,” does not know his burial place. <b>And R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says: For what</b> reason <b>was Moses buried near Beth Peor? In order to atone for the incident</b> that transpired at Beth <b>Peor</b> (Numbers, chapter 25). |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | “And he said: The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them” | Avodah Zarah2b:12 | The nations will <b>say before</b> God: <b>God!, did You give us</b> the Torah <b>and we did not accept it? </b> Since we never received the Torah, why are we being judged for not fulfilling its mitzvot? The Talmud asks: <b>And can one say that</b> they were never offered the Torah? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the description of the giving of the Torah: <b>“And he said: YHWH came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>and it is written: “God comes from Teman, </b> and the Holy One from mount Paran” (Habakkuk 3:3). And the rabbis asked: <b>What</b> did God <b>require in Seir and what</b> did He <b>require in Paran? </b> The Torah was not given in those locations. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | He appeared from Mount Paran” | Bava Kamma38a:4 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>from here: </b> It is stated in reference to the giving of the Torah: “YHWH came from Sinai and rose from Seir unto them; <b>He appeared from Mount Paran”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>From</b> the time God came from Mount <b>Paran, </b> when giving the Torah, <b>the money of</b> the non-Jew nations <b>appeared, </b> i.e., it was revealed and granted <b>to the Jewish people. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | “From His right hand went a fiery law for them” | Beitzah 25b:7 | The Talmud considers another aspect of the character of the Jewish people. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of R' Meir: For what reason was the Torah given to the Jewish people? </b> It is <b>because they are impudent, </b> and Torah study will weaken and humble them. A Sage <b>of the school of R' Yishmael taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“From His right hand went a fiery law for them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2); <b>God said: </b> Based on their nature and character, <b>these</b> people, the Jews, are <b>fit to be given a fiery law, </b> a hard and scorching faith. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ways</b> and nature <b>of these</b> people, the Jews, <b>are</b> like <b>fire, as, were it not for</b> the fact that <b>the Torah was given to the Jewish people, </b> whose study and observance restrains them, <b>no nation or tongue could withstand them. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | for good, as it is written: “He shined forth from Mount Paran” | Berakhot 33a:23 | <b>He said to him: Yes. At least in its place, </b> in the appropriate context, <b>it is great. </b> At times it is necessary. <b>That is that which Ulla said: Why</b> are <b>these two vengeances</b> mentioned in a single verse? <b>One for good and one for evil. </b> Vengeance <b>for good, as it is written: “He shined forth from Mount Paran”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2) with regard to God’s vengeance against the wicked; vengeance <b>for evil, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth”</b> with regard to the punishment of Israel. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them” | Berakhot 62a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>Why must one not wipe</b> himself <b>with his right</b> hand, <b>but with his left? Rava said: Because the Torah was given with the right</b> hand, <b>as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Because</b> the right hand <b>is close to the mouth, </b> i.e., people eat with the right hand. <b>And R' Shimon ben Lakish said: Because one ties the tefillin</b> onto his left hand <b>with</b> his right hand. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Because one points to the</b> cantillation <b>notes of the Torah with</b> his right hand. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | “From His right hand, a fiery law for His people” | Berakhot 6a:18 | Specifically, <b>“His right hand” refers to the Torah, as it is stated</b> in describing the giving of the Torah: <b>“From His right hand, a fiery law for His people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>“The arm of His strength, ”</b> His left hand, <b>refers to tefillin, as it is stated: “YHWH gave strength to His nation”</b> (Psalms 29:11), in the form of the mitzva of tefillin. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | “And He came [ ve’ata ] from the holy myriads” | Chagigah 16a:1 | The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> verse did R' Akiva <b>expound</b> that prevented him from making the same mistake as <i>Aḥer</i>? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: </b> It was the following: <b>“And He came [<i>ve’ata</i>] from the holy myriads”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), which he explained in this manner: <b>He, </b> God, <b>is unique [<i>ot</i>] among His myriads</b> of angels. Therefore, he knew that he had merely seen an angel. |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | that it is written with regard to him: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them” | Sotah 4b:16 | <b>Rather, </b> the rabbis <b>of the school of R' Sheila say: </b> This teaches that <b>even</b> if one who has sex with an adulteress had <b>received the Torah</b> from the hand of God <b>like Moses our teacher</b> did, <b>that it is written with regard to him: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), i.e., God gave the Torah from His right hand into the hand of Moses in order to give to the Jewish people, the sinner <b>will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:2 | to the right and then to the left, as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law to them” | Yoma 53b:3 | The Talmud comments that <b>this was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prays must take three steps backward</b> upon concluding his prayer <b>and then recite: Peace. And if he did not do so, it is better for him not to have prayed, </b> as his actions are disrespectful toward God. <b>And they said in the name of Shemaya</b> the Sage <b>that</b> when <b>one recites: Peace, </b> he first bows <b>to the right and then to the left, as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>and it says: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right side”</b> (Psalms 91:7). |
| Deuteronomy 33:3 | the Torah, as it is written: “Even when He loves the peoples, all His holy ones are in Your hand” | Bava Batra8a:3 | You have transgressed the words of <b>the Torah, as it is written: “Even when He loves the peoples, all His holy ones are in Your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:3), which is understood to mean that <b>Moses said to God: God!, even when You hold the</b> other <b>nations dear</b> and grant them dominion over Israel, let <b>“all His holy ones, ”</b> meaning the Torah scholars, <b>be</b> exclusively <b>in Your hand</b> and free from the authority of the nations, and therefore be exempt from paying taxes. The continuation of that verse can also be understood as referring to Torah scholars, as it states: <b>“And they sit [<i>tukku</i>] at Your feet, </b> receiving Your words” (Deuteronomy 33:3), and <b>Rav Yosef teaches: These are Torah scholars who pound [<i>mekhatetim</i>] their feet from city to city and from country to country to study Torah; “receiving [<i>yissa</i>] Your words, ” to discuss [<i>lissa velitten</i>] the utterances of God. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:4 | “Moses commanded us the Torah” | Bava Batra14a:7 | <b>The rabbis said to Rav Hamnuna: R' Ami wrote four hundred Torah scrolls. </b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to them: Perhaps he wrote</b> the verse: <b>“Moses commanded us the Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4) four hundred times, rather than four hundred complete Torah scrolls, as it is difficult to say that he could have written so many, even over a lifetime. Similarly, <b>Rava said to R' Zeira: R' Yannai planted four hundred vineyards. </b> Rava <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> he did not plant large vineyards, but only the smallest possible vineyards recognized by <i>halakha</i>, which are composed of <b>two</b> vines <b>facing</b> another <b>two</b> vines, with a 5th <b>one protruding</b> like <b>a tail, </b> extending out beyond the square. |
| Deuteronomy 33:4 | he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [ morasha ] of the congregation of Jacob” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had sex with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had sex with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather, </b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed.

| Deuteronomy 33:4 | morasha | Pesachim 49b:10 | The Talmud shifts to a discussion of an am ha'aretz who has some degree of sensitivity (<i>Me’iri</i>). <b>R' Ḥiyya taught: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>in the presence of an am ha'aretz, </b> causing the am ha'aretz embarrassment and anguish over his inability to study Torah, <b>is considered as though he had sex with</b> the am ha'aretz’s <b>betrothed</b> bride <b>in his presence, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us the Torah, an inheritance</b> [<b><i>morasha</i></b>] for the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read it</b> as <b>inheritance [<i>morasha</i>]; rather, </b> read it as <b>betrothed [<i>me’orasa</i>]. </b> The Torah is compared to the betrothed bride of the Jewish people until one studies it and thereby consummates his marriage with it. |

| Deuteronomy 33:10 | as it is written: “They shall teach Jacob Your ordinances | Yoma 26a:6 | Apropos this passage in Deuteronomy, <b>Rava said: You do not find a young Torah scholar who gives</b> halakhic <b>instruction unless he comes from the tribe of Levi or from the tribe of Issachar. </b> The assertion with regard to the tribe of <b>Levi</b> is <b>as it is written: “They shall teach Jacob Your ordinances</b> and Israel Your law” (Deuteronomy 33:10). And the assertion with regard to the tribe of <b>Issachar</b> is <b>as it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33). The Talmud asks: <b>And say</b> that scholars come from the tribe of <b>Judah also, as it is written: “Judah is my lawgiver”</b> (Psalms 60:9).

| Deuteronomy 33:11 | “Bless, Lord, his substance [ ḥeilo ], and accept the work of his hands” | Kiddushin 66b:11 | <b>Shmuel’s father said</b> that the proof text is <b>from here: </b> It states in the blessing of the tribe of Levi: <b>“Bless, Lord, his substance [<i>ḥeilo</i>], and accept the work of his hands”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:11). The word <i>ḥeilo</i> is expounded as including <b>even</b> the service of <b>his profane ones [<i>ḥullin</i>], </b> which God will <b>accept</b> after the fact. |
| Deuteronomy 33:11 | as it is written: “Bless, God, his property [ ḥeilo ], and accept the work of his hands” | Makkot 12a:1 | The Talmud rejects this parallel: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of R' Eliezer, everyone agrees</b> that he holds that the priesthood is voided. <b>When they disagree, </b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of R' Yehoshua: The one who says</b> the priesthood is <b>dead</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the straightforward understanding of the opinion of <b>R' Yehoshua. And the one who says</b> the priesthood is <b>voided</b> can also hold in accordance with his opinion and explain that <b>R' Yehoshua states</b> his opinion <b>only there, </b> with regard to Temple service, <b>as it is written: “Bless, God, his property [<i>ḥeilo</i>], and accept the work of his hands”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:11). The term <i>ḥeilo</i> is interpreted homiletically to mean that <b>even</b> the offerings of <b>those disqualified from Temple service due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalalin</i>]</b> are accepted after the fact. <b>But here, </b> with regard to the status of the priest, <b>even R' Yehoshua concedes</b> that the priesthood is voided retroactively. |
| Deuteronomy 33:11 | “Bless, Lord, his substance and accept the work of his hands” | Pesachim 72b:26 | <b>As we learned</b> in a Mishnah: If a priest <b>was standing and sacrificing offerings</b> on the altar, <b>and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or the son of a woman who underwent <i>ḥalitza</i>, all the offerings that he offered on the altar</b> until that time <b>are disqualified, </b> because only service performed by a priest deemed fit is acceptable. <b>And R' Yehoshua validates</b> them. <b>And we said: What is the reason of R' Yehoshua? As it is written</b> with regard to the tribe of Levi: <b>“Bless, Lord, his substance and accept the work of his hands”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:11), which teaches that after the fact, God accepts the work of a priest’s hands, even if it becomes clear that he was actually disqualified at the time he performed the service. |
| Deuteronomy 33:11 | after that: “Bless, O Lord, his substance” | Yoma 26a:4 | <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: What is the reason</b> for this assertion that the one who burns the incense becomes wealthy? <b>If we say it is because it is written: “They shall put incense before You</b> and whole burnt-offerings on Your altar” (Deuteronomy 33:10), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>after that: “Bless, O Lord, his substance”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:11), <b>if so, </b> we should <b>also</b> make the same assertion concerning those who perform the sacrifice of <b>a burnt-offering, since it is written</b> in that same verse: <b>“And whole burnt-offerings on Your altar. ”</b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:12 | “With everything,” “from everything,” “everything.” Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is written with regard to them: “By the mouth of the Lord”; Benjamin, son of Jacob, as it is written: “And to Benjamin he said: The beloved of the Lord, he shall dwell in safety by Him” | Bava Batra17a:5 | <b>A baraita states: </b> There were <b>seven</b> people <b>over whom the worm and the maggot had no sway, and they are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob.

Even in death, he rests securely, unbothered by worms. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even David</b> is included, <b>as it is written: “My flesh also dwells secure”</b> (Psalms 16:9). The Talmud asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> authority, who does not include David, explain this?

Figs on a tree do not all ripen at once but ripen first on the side where the sun rises, so R' Yoḥanan searched first for figs on the east side of the tree. <b>And I</b> thereby <b>fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“Wisdom preserves the lives of those who have it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12). <b>As Rav Yosef taught: One who wishes to taste the flavor of the fig should turn to the east, as it is stated: “And for the precious things of the sun’s fruits”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:14), implying that the sun ripens fruit and makes them sweet. |
| Deuteronomy 33:16 | “And the good will of Him Who dwelt in the bush [ seneh ]” | Zevachim 118b:3 | <b>R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says</b> that another allusion may be found in the context of Moses’ blessing to Joseph: <b>“And the good will of Him Who dwelt in the bush [<i>seneh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:16). The Talmud interprets the word “<i>seneh</i>” homiletically: <b>An eye that did not wish to derive benefit from something that was not his shall merit</b> to have offerings of lesser sanctity <b>consumed among the haters [<i>senu’in</i>]. </b> In other words, offerings of lesser sanctity may be consumed in any place that overlooks Shiloh, even in the portions of the other tribes, who are described by the Torah as hating Joseph (see Genesis, chapter 37). |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | the portion of two tribes | Bava Kamma17a:10 | <b>And</b> the fact that <b>he merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes</b> is derived as follows: The reference to the ox in the verse is an allusion to Joseph, who is described as an ox (Deuteronomy 33:17), and one’s reward is that <b>he merits to</b> receive <b>a canopy</b> of honor, <b>as</b> did <b>Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, </b> a fruitful vine by a fountain; <b>its branches run over the wall. ”</b> The branches over the wall in this verse allude to the canopy. <b>And</b> the reference to the donkey is an allusion to the fact that <b>he merits</b> to receive <b>the portion of Issachar, </b> who is described as a donkey, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | with them he shall gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth” | Bava Kamma17a:11 | <b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that the comparison should be understood in a different manner. <b>His enemies will fall before him</b> just <b>like</b> in the blessing given by Moses to the tribe of <b>Joseph, as it is written</b> in the blessing bestowed by Moses to the tribe of Joseph: “His horns are the horns of the wild-ox; <b>with them he shall gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). <b>And he merits the understanding of Issachar, as it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33). |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations” | Bava Kamma2b:4 | The Talmud elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive the primary category of <b>Goring? </b> The source is <b>as A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <b>goring is</b> performed <b>only</b> with <b>a horn, as it is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and said: So says YHWH: With these shall you gore the Arameans, </b> until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his” | Berakhot 56b:15 | <b>One who sees an ox in a dream, </b> should <b>rise early and recite: “His firstling bullock, majesty is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17), <b>before a different verse, </b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“And if an ox gore a man”</b> (Exodus 21:28). |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | it is not called shofar , as it is written: “His firstborn bull, grandeur is his, and his horns [ karnav ] are the horns of [ karnei ] a wild ox” | Rosh Hashanah26a:4 | <strong>Talmud: </strong> <b>R' Yosei is saying well, </b> i.e., presents a convincing argument. Why do the Rabbis not accept it? The Talmud explains that <b>the Rabbis</b> counter R' Yosei’s argument as follows: Indeed, <b>all</b> other <b><i>shofarot</i> are called <i>shofar</i> and</b> they are also <b>called <i>keren</i>, </b> but that of <b>a cow is called <i>keren</i>, </b> but <b>it is not called <i>shofar</i>, as it is written: “His firstborn bull, grandeur is his, and his horns [<i>karnav</i>] are the horns of [<i>karnei</i>] a wild ox”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). It is therefore clear that the horns of a bull are called <i>keren</i>, and nowhere are they called <i>shofar</i>. |
| Deuteronomy 33:17 | first bullock” | Sotah 11b:20 | <b>Rather, </b> the midwives <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>This nation is compared to an animal [<i>ḥayya</i>], </b> and animals give birth without a midwife. For example, with regard to <b>Judah</b> it is written: “Judah is <b>a lion’s whelp”</b> (Genesis 49:9); with regard to <b>Dan</b> it is written: <b>“Dan shall be a serpent</b> in the way” (Genesis 49:17); with regard to <b>Naphtali</b> it is written: <b>“A hind let loose”</b> (Genesis 49:21); with regard to <b>Issachar</b> it is written: <b>“A large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14); with regard to <b>Joseph</b> it is written: “His <b>first bullock”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17); with regard to <b>Benjamin</b> it is written: <b>“A ravenous wolf”</b> (Genesis 49:27). |
| Deuteronomy 33:19 | and of the hidden treasures of the sand” | Megillah 6a:7 | The verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>Zebulun said before God: God!! To my brothers, </b> the tribes whose territory is adjacent to mine, <b>You gave fields and vineyards, whereas to me You gave mountains and hills; to my brothers You gave lands, whereas to me You gave seas and rivers. </b> God <b>said</b> back <b>to him: </b> Nevertheless, <b>all will need you due to the <i>ḥilazon</i>, </b> the small sea creature residing in your territory that is the source of the dye used in the ritual fringes [<i>tzitzit</i>]. <b>As it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing to Zebulun: <b>“They shall call the people to the mountain: </b> There they shall sacrifice offerings of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, <b>and of the hidden treasures of the sand”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:19). |
| Deuteronomy 33:21 | “And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the inscriber’s [ meḥokek ] portion reserved” | Bava Batra15a:13 | The Talmud answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> in the continuation of the previously mentioned verse: <b>“Oh, that</b> my words <b>were inscribed [<i>veyuḥaku</i>] in a book”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is Moses who is called the inscriber, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the inscriber’s [<i>meḥokek</i>] portion reserved”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21). |
| Deuteronomy 33:21 | “And he chose a first part for himself, | Sotah 13b:22 | R' Yehuda continues: <b>And where is Moses buried? In the portion of Gad, as it is written</b> in the blessing of Moses to the tribe of Gad: <b>“And he chose a first part for himself, </b> for there a portion of a ruler was reserved” (Deuteronomy 33:21), indicating that Moses, the ruler, is buried in the portion of Gad. <b>And how much is</b> the distance <b>from the portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad? Four <i>mil</i>. </b> R' Yehuda asks: For <b>those four <i>mil</i></b> from Mount Nebo in the portion of Reuben to the burial place of Moses in the portion of Gad, <b>who transported him? </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:21 | and the ministering angels were saying: “He executed the righteousness of the Lord, and His ordinances with Israel” | Sotah 13b:23 | He answers: The contradiction between the two verses <b>teaches that Moses was lying in the wings of the Shekhina, </b> as Moses was carried out by God Himself, <b>and the ministering angels were saying: “He executed the righteousness of YHWH, and His ordinances with Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21). <b>And God was saying: “Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of iniquity? ”</b> (Psalms 94:16). In other words, God asked: Who will now defend the Jewish people against its accusers? The idea that God Himself transported Moses to his burial could not have been said if not for the proof from the resolution between the contradictory verses. |
| Deuteronomy 33:23 | possess the sea and the south” | Bava Kamma81b:4 | <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sea of Tiberias was</b> located <b>in the portion of</b> the tribe of <b>Naphtali. Moreover, </b> the tribe of Naphtali <b>received</b> in addition a small stretch of land equal to <b>the full</b> length of the <b>rope of</b> a fish <b>trap. </b> This stretch of land was located <b>to the south</b> of the sea, where the members of this tribe could spread out their fishing nets, <b>to fulfill that which is stated: </b> “And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of YHWH; <b>possess the sea and the south”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:23). |
| Deuteronomy 33:23 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who recites a blessing over a full cup, they give him a boundless inheritance, as it is stated: “And full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the sea and the south” | Berakhot 51a:18 | <b>R' Yoḥanan said: Anyone who recites a blessing over a full cup, they give him a boundless inheritance, as it is stated: “And full of the blessing of YHWH, possess the sea and the south”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:23), indicating that one whose cup is full will receive God’s blessing and will inherit from all sides. <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He merits and inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:24 | and immerse his foot in oil” | Menachot 85b:14 | § The Talmud digresses to discuss the tribal portion of Asher, in which the city of Tekoa is located: <b>A baraita states</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In his blessing to the tribe of Asher, Moses said: “He will be pleasing to his brothers, <b>and immerse his foot in oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:24). <b>This</b> is referring to <b>the portion of Asher, as the oil flows</b> there <b>like a spring. </b> The Talmud relates: <b>They said</b> that <b>once, the people of Laodicea were in need of oil. They appointed</b> a non-Jew <b>messenger [<i>polmostos</i>]</b> and <b>said to him: Go and bring us one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:24 | “And immerse his foot in oil” | Menachot 85b:16 | <b>After he completed his labor, </b> the man <b>slung his tools</b> over his shoulders <b>behind him, </b> a manner typical of poor laborers, and started walking, <b>and he was removing stones</b> from his orchard <b>as he went along the path. </b> Upon seeing this behavior, which suggested the man was merely a laborer, the messenger questioned whether the man was truly able to provide him with the oil. <b>He said to</b> the man: Can it be that <b>you</b> really <b>have</b> the <b>one million</b> <i>maneh</i> worth <b>of oil that I need? It seems to me that the Jews</b> of Gush Ḥalav <b>are making a laughingstock of me</b> by sending me here. <b>When he reached his city, </b> the man’s <b>female slave brought out to him a kettle [<i>kumkemos</i>] of hot</b> water, <b>and he washed his hands and his feet. </b> Afterward, <b>she brought out to him a golden basin filled with oil, in which he immersed his hands and feet, in fulfillment of that</b> which <b>is stated</b> with regard to the Tribe of Asher: <b>“And immerse his foot in oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:24). |
| Deuteronomy 33:26 | “rides”: Here, it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the skies [ Aravot ],” and there, it is written: “Who rides upon the heaven as your help” | Chagigah 12b:14 | <b>There, </b> in the firmaments, are the <b><i>ofanim</i>, </b> the <b>seraphim, </b> the <b>holy divine creatures, and the ministering angels, and the Throne of Glory. The King, God, </b> the <b>living, lofty, exalted One dwells above them in <i>Aravot</i>, as it is stated: “Extol Him Who rides upon the skies [<i>Aravot</i>], Whose name is God”</b> (Psalms 68:5). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> <i>Aravot</i> <b>is called “heaven”? </b> This is <b>learned</b> by using a verbal analogy between two instances of <b>“rides”</b> and <b>“rides”: Here, it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the skies [<i>Aravot</i>], ” and there, it is written: “Who rides upon the heaven as your help”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:26). |
| Deuteronomy 33:27 | storm hangs upon the arm of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms” | Chagigah 12b:2 | § <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>R' Yosei says: Woe to them, the creations, who see and know not what they see; </b> who <b>stand and know not upon what they stand. </b> He clarifies: <b>Upon what does the earth stand? Upon pillars, as it is stated: “Who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble”</b> (Job 9:6). These <b>pillars</b> are positioned <b>upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters”</b> (Psalms 136:6). These <b>waters</b> stand <b>upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains”</b> (Psalms 104:6). The <b>mountains</b> are upon the <b>wind, as it is stated: “For behold He forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). The <b>wind</b> is <b>upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word”</b> (Psalms 148:8). The <b>storm hangs upon the arm of God as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), which demonstrates that the entire world rests upon the arms of God. |
| Deuteronomy 33:27 | one who renders himself as if he were non-existent, as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms” | Chullin 89a:9 | With regard to that verse, <b>R' Ile’a says: The world endures only in the merit of one who restrains [<i>shebolem</i>] himself during a quarrel, as it is stated: “He hangs the earth upon nothing [<i>belima</i>]. R' Abbahu says: </b> The world endures only in the merit of <b>one who renders himself as if he were non-existent, as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), i.e., one who considers himself to be underneath everything else is the everlasting arm that upholds the world. |
| Deuteronomy 33:28 | four prophets came and revoked them. Moses said: “And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain [ ein ] of Jacob alone” | Makkot 24a:28 | § <b>R' Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Moses our teacher issued four decrees upon the Jewish people, </b> and <b>four prophets came and revoked them. Moses said: “And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain [<i>ein</i>] of Jacob alone”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:28), indicating that the Jewish people will dwell in safety only when they reach a lofty spiritual level similar to [<i>me’ein</i>] that of Jacob our forefather. <b>Amos came and revoked it, as it is stated: </b> “Lord God, <b>cease, I beseech You; how shall Jacob stand, </b> as he is small” (Amos 7:5), <b>and</b> immediately afterward <b>it states: “YHWH regretted this; </b> it too shall not be, says YHWH God” (Amos 7:6). |
| Deuteronomy 33:28 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I said: “And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, to a land of grain and wine; also His heavens shall drop down dew” | Sanhedrin 104a:14 | With regard to the phrase “Does the city <b>sit solitary, ” Rava says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>God said: I said: “And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain of Jacob in solitude, to a land of grain and wine; also His heavens shall drop down dew”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:28), indicating that their solitude shall be one of wealth and prominence. <b>Now</b> that they have rejected my directive and cleaved to and learned from the non-Jews, <b>their dwelling shall be solitary</b> in sorrow. With regard to the phrase: <b>“The city that was full of people”</b> (Lamentations 1:1), <b>Rava says</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan says: They would marry a younger female to an older male and an older female to a younger male so that they would have many children. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 33:29 | “Happy are you, Israel, | Berakhot 6a:24 | Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b> In those three compartments it is written: <b>“For who is a great nation, </b> to whom God is close, like YHWH our God whenever we call upon Him? ” (Deuteronomy 4:7); <b>“And who is a great nation, </b> who has righteous statutes and laws, like this entire Torah which I set before you today? ” (Deuteronomy 4:8); <b>“Happy are you, Israel, </b> who is like you? A people saved by YHWH, the shield of your help, and that is the sword of your excellence. And your enemies shall dwindle away before you, and you shall tread upon their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29); <b>“Or has God attempted</b> to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders” (Deuteronomy 4:34); <b>“And to elevate you</b> above all nations that He has made, in praise, in name and in glory; that you may be a holy people to YHWH, your God, as He has spoken” (Deuteronomy 26:19). |
| Deuteronomy 33:29 | Jews, but with regard to you it is written: “And you shall tread upon their high places” | Megillah 16a:10 | <b>After</b> Haman <b>trimmed his hair, </b> Haman <b>dressed</b> Mordecai in <b>the</b> royal <b>garments. </b> Haman then <b>said to him: Mount</b> the horse <b>and ride. </b> Mordecai <b>said to him: I am unable, as my strength has waned from the days of fasting</b> that I observed. Haman then <b>stooped down</b> before him <b>and</b> Mordecai <b>ascended</b> on him. <b>As he was ascending</b> the horse, Mordecai <b>gave</b> Haman <b>a kick. </b> Haman <b>said to him: Is it not written for you: “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls”</b> (Proverbs 24:17)? Mordecai <b>said to him: This</b> statement <b>applies</b> only to <b>Jews, but with regard to you it is written: “And you shall tread upon their high places”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29). |
| Deuteronomy 33:29 | and you will trample their high places [ bamoteimo ]” | Shabbat 118b:2 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b> One who delights in Shabbat <b>is rescued from the oppression of exile. </b> He derives it by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here, </b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“And I will cause you to ride on the heights [<i>bamotei</i>] of the world”</b> (Isaiah 58:14), <b>and it is written there: </b> “You are fortunate Israel, who is like you? A nation redeemed by God, the shield that aids you and the sword of your triumph. Your enemies will try to defeat you <b>and you will trample their high places [<i>bamoteimo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b> With regard to <b>anyone who delights in the Shabbat, </b> God <b>grants him his heart’s desires, </b> as <b>it is stated: “And you shall delight in God and He will grant you your heart’s desires”</b> (Psalms 37:4). <b>This delight</b> in God, which is mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When it says: “And you shall call the Shabbat delight, ”</b> one <b>must say: It is the delight of Shabbat. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>With what does one delight</b> in the day of Shabbat? <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: With a dish of beets, and large fish, and heads of garlic. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi</b> said that <b>Rav said: Even</b> with regard to <b>a small item and one prepared it in deference to Shabbat, it is</b> a <b>delight. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>What is</b> the small item mentioned? <b>Rav Pappa said: Small fried fish. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 34:1 | “And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo” | Sotah 13b:17 | The verse continues: <b>“I can no longer go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“go out and come in”? If we say</b> it means literally that Moses was <b>actually</b> physically restricted from <b>going out and coming in, but isn’t it written: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, </b> his eye was not dim, <b>nor his natural force abated”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:7), indicating that he was at full physical strength? <b>And it is written</b> further: <b>“And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were twelve steps there</b> to ascend the mountain, <b>and Moses stepped over them</b> all in <b>one step, </b> also indicating that he was at full physical strength. |
| Deuteronomy 34:1 | Where did Moses die? In the portion of Reuben, as it is written: “And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo” | Sotah 13b:20 | <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Yehuda said: If not for</b> an explicitly <b>written verse, one could not say</b> what is written with regard to the death and burial of Moses. <b>Where did Moses die? In the portion of Reuben, as it is written: “And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1), <b>and</b> it is known from elsewhere that <b>Nebo is situated in the portion of Reuben, as it is written: “And the children of Reuben built</b> Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, <b>and Nebo”</b> (Numbers 32:37–38). |
| Deuteronomy 34:4 | that the dead converse with each other? As it is stated: “And the Lord said to him, this is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: | Berakhot 18b:17 | In any case, with regard to the crux of the issue, <b>R' Yonatan also reconsidered</b> his opinion, <b>as R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>R' Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the dead converse with each other? As it is stated: “And YHWH said to him, this is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: </b> I will give it to your offspring” (Deuteronomy 34:4). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“saying”? </b> It means that <b>God told Moses: Go and tell Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, </b> that <b>the oath that I swore to you I have already fulfilled for your descendants. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | “And Moses the servant of the Lord died there” | Bava Batra15a:4 | The Talmud elaborates on the particulars of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above that <b>Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses of the Torah. </b> The Talmud comments: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught in accordance with the one who says that</b> it was <b>Joshua</b> who <b>wrote the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah. </b> This point is subject to a tannaitic dispute, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses the servant of YHWH died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5); <b>is it possible that</b> after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this point, </b> and <b>Joshua wrote from this</b> point <b>forward; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>R' Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | to Moses: | Bava Batra17a:4 | The Talmud asks: <b>But with regard to Miriam it is not written: “By the mouth of YHWH. ” R' Elazar says: Miriam also died with a kiss, as this is learned</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned in regard to Miriam: “And Miriam died there” (Numbers 20:1), and the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned in regard <b>to Moses: </b> “And Moses died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>And for what</b> reason <b>is “by the mouth of YHWH” not stated with</b> regard to <b>her? It is unseemly to mention</b> death by a kiss with regard to a woman. |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | died on the seventh of Adar? As it is stated: “So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there” | Kiddushin 38a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses died on the 7th of Adar, and he was</b> likewise <b>born on the 7th of Adar. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> Moses <b>died on the 7th of Adar? As it is stated: “So Moses, the servant of YHWH, died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). <b>And it is written: “Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of YHWH”</b> (Joshua 1:1), <b>and it is written: “Moses, My servant, is dead; now arise, cross</b> this Jordan” (Joshua 1:2). |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | “And Moses the servant of the Lord died there” | Menachot 30a:6 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And Moses the servant of YHWH died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Is it possible</b> that after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote: “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this</b> point, and <b>Joshua bin Nun wrote from this</b> point <b>forward; </b> this is <b>the statement of R' Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>R' Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion. |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | with regard to Moses. | Moed Katan28a:3 | With regard to that same verse <b>R' Elazar said</b> further: <b>Miriam also died by</b> the divine <b>kiss, </b> just like her brother Moses. What is the source for this? <b>This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> stated with regard to Miriam and the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned <b>with regard to Moses. </b> With regard to Moses it says: “So Moses the servant of YHWH died there in the land of Moab by the mouth of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>For what</b> reason <b>was it not</b> explicitly <b>stated with regard to her, </b> as it is stated with regard to Moses, that she died <b>“by the mouth of YHWH”? </b> It is <b>because it would be unseemly to say such a thing, </b> that a woman died by way of a divine kiss, and therefore it is not said explicitly. |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | died there” | Sotah 13b:24 | <b>And Shmuel says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Who is as the wise man and who knows the interpretation [<i>pesher</i>] of a matter? ”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1), referring to the greatness of Moses, who was able to forge compromises, <i>pesharim</i>, between God and the Jewish people. <b>And R' Yoḥanan says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“Wisdom, where can it be found? ”</b> (Job 28:12). <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that God was saying the verse: <b>“And Moses, </b> the servant of God, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Semalyon says</b> that God was saying: <b>And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died there. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 34:5 | died there” | Sotah 13b:25 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>R' Eliezer the Great says: </b> Over an area of <b>twelve <i>mil</i> by twelve <i>mil</i>, equivalent to the</b> size of the <b>camp of Israel, a bat kol proclaimed and said: And Moses, the great scribe of Israel, died. And some say: Moses did not</b> actually <b>die, </b> as <b>it is written here: “And</b> Moses, the servant of YHWH, <b>died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written there: “And he was there with YHWH</b> forty days and forty nights” (Exodus 34:28). <b>Just as there, </b> where it says: “And he was there with YHWH,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God; <b>so too, here, </b> when it says: “And Moses, the servant of YHWH, died there,” it means that <b>he was standing and serving</b> before God. |
| Deuteronomy 34:6 | “And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; | Sotah 13b:26 | The verse describing the burial of Moses states: <b>“And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; </b> and no man knows of his grave to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). <b>R' Berekhya says: </b> This verse provides <b>a sign within a sign, </b> i.e., a very precise description of the location of his burial, <b>and even with this</b> the verse concludes: <b>“And no man knows of his grave</b> to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). |
| Deuteronomy 34:6 | appeared to them to be above, to fulfill that which is stated: “And no man knows of his grave | Sotah 14a:1 | <b>the garrison [<i>gastera</i>] of Beth Peor</b> and said to them: <b>Show us where Moses is buried. </b> As the men <b>stood above</b> on the upper section of the mountain, <b>it appeared to them</b> as if the grave was <b>below</b> in the lower section. As they stood <b>below, it appeared to them</b> to be <b>above. They divided into two groups, </b> one above and one below. To <b>those who were standing above, </b> the grave <b>appeared to them</b> to be <b>below; </b> to those who were standing <b>below, </b> the grave <b>appeared to them to be above, to fulfill that which is stated: “And no man knows of his grave</b> to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). |
| Deuteronomy 34:6 | the Holy One, Blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley | Sotah 14a:4 | He explains: <b>Rather, </b> the meaning is <b>that one should follow the attributes of God. </b> He provides several examples. <b>Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And YHWH God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21), <b>so too, </b> should <b>you clothe the naked. </b> Just as <b>God visits the sick, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: <b>“And YHWH appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>so too, </b> should <b>you visit the sick. </b> Just as <b>God consoles mourners, as it is written: “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son”</b> (Genesis 25:11), <b>so too, </b> should <b>you console mourners. </b> Just as <b>God buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6), <b>so too, </b> should <b>you bury the dead. </b> |
| Deuteronomy 34:6 | And its end is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley | Sotah 14a:6 | <b>R' Samlai taught: </b> With regard to the <b>Torah, its beginning is an act of kindness and its end is an act of kindness. Its beginning is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And YHWH God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21). <b>And its end is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6). |
| Deuteronomy 34:6 | as it is stated: “And He buried him in the valley | Sotah 9b:10 | <b>Moses merited</b> to be the only person involved <b>in</b> the transportation of <b>Joseph’s bones</b> to be buried in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and there was none among the Jewish people greater than he, as it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him”</b> (Exodus 13:19). <b>Who</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Moses, as no one involved himself in his</b> burial <b>other than God</b> Himself, <b>as it is stated: “And He buried him in the valley</b> in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor; and no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6). The Mishnah comments: <b>Not only with regard to Moses did</b> the rabbis <b>say</b> that God takes part in his burial, <b>but</b> also <b>with regard to all the righteous individuals, as it is stated: “Your righteousness shall go before you and the glory of YHWH shall gather you in”</b> (Isaiah 58:8). |
| Deuteronomy 34:7 | nor his natural force abated” | Sotah 13b:17 | The verse continues: <b>“I can no longer go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). The Talmud asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“go out and come in”? If we say</b> it means literally that Moses was <b>actually</b> physically restricted from <b>going out and coming in, but isn’t it written: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, </b> his eye was not dim, <b>nor his natural force abated”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:7), indicating that he was at full physical strength? <b>And it is written</b> further: <b>“And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:1). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There were twelve steps there</b> to ascend the mountain, <b>and Moses stepped over them</b> all in <b>one step, </b> also indicating that he was at full physical strength. |
| Deuteronomy 34:8 | because I am not better than Moses, our teacher, as it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days” | Ketubot 103b:3 | R' Yehuda HaNasi further instructed: <b>Reconvene the</b> study sessions at the <b>yeshiva after thirty days</b> of mourning. This is <b>because I am not better than Moses, our teacher, as it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8), which means that for <b>thirty days they eulogized</b> him <b>by day and night.

| Deuteronomy 34:8 | and it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days” | Kiddushin 38a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses died on the 7th of Adar, and he was</b> likewise <b>born on the 7th of Adar. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> Moses <b>died on the 7th of Adar? As it is stated: “So Moses, the servant of YHWH, died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). <b>And it is written: “Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of YHWH”</b> (Joshua 1:1), <b>and it is written: “Moses, My servant, is dead; now arise, cross</b> this Jordan” (Joshua 1:2). |
| Deuteronomy 34:8 | Rav Mattana said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written: “And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended” | Moed Katan21a:11 | <b>Rav Mattana said: What is the reason of R' Eliezer? As it is written: “And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). The plural term “days” implies a minimum of two, and it indicates that the main portion of the mourning period is the first two full days. <b>Rav Eina said: What is the reason of R' Yehoshua? As it is written: </b> “And I will make it as the mourning for an only son, <b>and its end as a bitter day”</b> (Amos 8:10), i.e., a single “day. ” |
| Deuteronomy 34:9 | And it is written: “And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, | Bava Kamma92b:10 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: </b> While <b>the wine</b> belongs <b>to its owner, the gratitude</b> is given <b>to the one who pours it? </b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to God commanding Moses to transfer his authority to Joshua: “And YHWH said unto Moses: Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit, <b>and lay your hand upon him…that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken”</b> (Numbers 27:18–20). <b>And it is written: “And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, </b> and did as YHWH commanded Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:9). Although the spirit of God was not given to Joshua by Moses, as Moses was only a conduit, he was given credit for it. |
| Deuteronomy 34:10 | “And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, | Rosh Hashanah21b:12 | <b>“Kohelet sought to find out words of delight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10), which indicates that he sought to find the fiftieth gate but failed to do so. <b>Kohelet, </b> King Solomon, <b>sought to be like Moses, </b> but <b>a bat kol issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10). This is referring to the words of the Torah; and what is written there? <b>“And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, </b> whom YHWH knew face-to-face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). |
| Deuteronomy 34:12 | “In the sight of all Israel” | Menachot 30a:3 | The Talmud asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rav <b>say</b> his statement with regard to <b>a Torah scroll? </b> The Talmud answers: He was referring <b>to</b> one of the <b>five</b> books <b>that</b> constitute <b>a Torah scroll. </b> Rav meant that when writing a Torah scroll, one may finish writing any of the first four books in the middle of a column. The Talmud asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t R' Yehoshua bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: </b> The words: <b>“In the sight of all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:12), which conclude the Torah, may be written even <b>in the middle of the column? </b> The Talmud answers: <b>That</b> ruling that <b>was stated</b> is <b>with regard to</b> finishing the Torah scroll <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>line, </b> i.e., in the middle of the width of the column. |
