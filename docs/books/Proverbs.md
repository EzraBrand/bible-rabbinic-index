| Proverbs 1:8 | his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother” | Berakhot 35b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Proverbs 1:8 | “And do not forsake the Torah of your mother” | Chullin 93b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: These crushed testicles are permitted</b> for consumption, <b>but you should not eat them due to</b> the dictum: <b>“And do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). Since Rav Shemen bar Abba was from Babylonia, where it was customary to be stringent, it was prohibited for him to eat crushed testicles even when he was in Eretz Yisrael. |
| Proverbs 1:8 | as it is stated: “My son, hear your father’s rebuke and do not abandon your mother’s teaching” | Pesachim 50b:11 | As the mishna discusses the requirement to observe local customs, the Gemara relates: <b>The residents of Beit She’an were accustomed not to travel from Tyre to</b> market day in <b>Sidon on Shabbat eve.</b> In deference to Shabbat, they adopted a stringency and would not interrupt their Shabbat preparations even for a short sea voyage. <b>Their children came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to request that he repeal this custom. <b>They said to him:</b> Due to their wealth, it was possible for <b>our fathers</b> to earn a living without traveling to the market on Friday; <b>however, it is not possible for us</b> to do so. <b>He said to them: Your fathers already accepted</b> this virtuous custom <b>upon themselves,</b> and it remains in effect for you, <b>as it is stated: “My son, hear your father’s rebuke and do not abandon your mother’s teaching”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). In addition to adhering to one’s father’s rebuke, i.e., <i>halakha</i>, one is also required to preserve his mother’s teaching, i.e., ancestral customs. |
| Proverbs 1:8 | none other than the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother” | Sanhedrin 102a:11 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who derives benefit from this world without</b> reciting <b>a blessing, it is as though he stole from the Holy One, Blessed be He, and the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a corrupter”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his father”</b> is referring to <b>none other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you?” (Deuteronomy 32:6). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his mother”</b> is referring to <b>none other than the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mother indicates that the mother represents the congregation of Israel, and the Torah of the mother is the tradition of the Jewish people. |
| Proverbs 1:9 | not deserving, a necklace is prepared for him, as it is stated: “And necklaces about your neck” | Bava Batra75a:7 | If one is <b>deserving</b> at least of this reward, <b>a covering is prepared for him,</b> and if one is <b>not deserving, a necklace is prepared for him, as it is stated: “And necklaces about your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9). If one is somewhat <b>deserving, a necklace is prepared for him,</b> and if one is <b>not deserving</b> even of this, only <b>an amulet is prepared for him</b> from the skin of the leviathan, <b>as it is stated: “Or will you bind him for your maidens”</b> (Job 40:29), i.e., a small amulet is prepared for him, like the amulets tied on children’s necks. |
| Proverbs 1:9 | that which is written: “And chains about your neck” | Eruvin 54a:16 | In light of the previous discussion, the Gemara cites several expositions of verses proposed by Rabbi Eliezer, while first providing them with a <b>mnemonic: Chains, cheeks, tablets, engraved. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And chains about your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9)? <b>If a person makes himself like a chain that hangs loosely on the neck,</b> i.e., if a scholar is not pushy and disruptive to others, <b>and</b> he is also <b>seen but not seen,</b> i.e., just as a chain is covered by clothes and hair, so too, the scholar does not let himself be seen, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure. But if not,</b> if he acts in a rude and arrogant manner, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will not endure.</b> |
| Proverbs 1:9 | “For they shall be a graceful wreath [ livyat ḥen ] | Eruvin 54a:6 | Having expounded the verse “For they are life to those who find them” as referring to the Torah, the Gemara cites another teaching related to this verse that praises the Torah. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who is walking along the way without a companion</b> and is afraid <b>should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the words of Torah: <b>“For they shall be a graceful wreath [<i>livyat ḥen</i>]</b> for your head, and chains about your neck” (Proverbs 1:9). The word <i>livyat</i> is understood here as a reference to <i>levaya</i>, accompaniment, so that the verse is interpreted to mean that Torah is a graceful accompaniment to one who is traveling. |
| Proverbs 1:9 | “For they shall be a chaplet of grace to your head, and chains around your neck” | Sotah 46b:14 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One who walks along the way without</b> having someone to <b>accompany</b> him <b>should occupy himself with</b> words of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to words of Torah: <b>“For they shall be a chaplet of grace to your head, and chains around your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9). <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>says: Due to four steps that Pharaoh accompanied Abraham, as it is stated: “And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him,</b> and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had” (Genesis 12:20), Pharaoh <b>enslaved</b> Abraham’s <b>descendants</b> for <b>four hundred years, as it is stated: “And shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years”</b> (Genesis 15:13). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who accompanies his friend four cubits in a city will come to no harm</b> by accompanying him. The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina accompanied Rava bar Yitzḥak four cubits in a city. He came close to harm, but he was saved.</b> |
| Proverbs 1:17 | As it is stated: “For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird” | Sotah 38b:11 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even birds recognize miserly</b> people and do not eat the food they have set in bird traps? <b>As it is stated: “For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird”</b> (Proverbs 1:17). |
| Proverbs 1:19 | as it is written: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof” | Bava Kamma119a:10 | The Gemara elaborates: The rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that the verse is referring to <b>the soul of the robbed</b> is <b>as it is written: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof”</b> (Proverbs 1:19), which teaches that one who robs another of his property is considered as one who robbed him of his soul. And the rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>the soul of the robber</b> is <b>as it is written: “Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them”</b> (Proverbs 22:22–23). |
| Proverbs 1:19 | as though he takes his soul from him, as it is stated: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof” | Bava Kamma119a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who robs another</b> of an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i></b> is considered <b>as though he takes his soul from him, as it is stated: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof”</b> (Proverbs 1:19). <b>And it states: “And they shall consume your harvest, and your bread,</b> they shall consume <b>your sons and your daughters”</b> (Jeremiah 5:17). Since they will consume the harvest and bread, it is as though they consume one’s children as well because there will be no food to feed them. |
| Proverbs 1:19 | as it is written: “So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its owners” | Bava Metzia112a:3 | The Gemara cites proof for these two opinions. <b>The one who says</b> it is referring to <b>the soul of the robber</b> bases his opinion on a verse, <b>as it is written: “Do not rob from the weak because he is weak, nor crush the poor in the gate”</b> (Proverbs 22:22), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those who spoil them”</b> (Proverbs 22:23). This indicates that God will take the soul of one who steals from a poor person. <b>And the one who says</b> it is referring to <b>the soul of the robbery victim</b> bases his opinion on a verse, <b>as it is written: “So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its owners”</b> (Proverbs 1:19). A robber is considered as if he removed the very soul of his victim. |
| Proverbs 1:20 | One who sees a goose in a dream should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Wisdoms cry aloud in the streets, | Berakhot 57a:10 | <b>One who sees a goose in a dream should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Wisdoms cry aloud in the streets,</b> she utters her voice in the broad places” (Proverbs 1:20); geese tend to sound their voices. One who dreams that <b>he has relations with</b> the goose <b>will become head of the yeshiva. Rav Ashi said: I saw</b> a goose and <b>had relations with it</b> in my dream <b>and I ascended to greatness</b> and became head of the yeshiva. |
| Proverbs 1:20 | said to him: As it is written: “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets” | Moed Katan16b:6 | § Concerning the issue with which the entire incident had begun, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi asked Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>What is the reason that</b> you, <b>the Master, acted as</b> you did, ignoring my instructions not to teach Torah in the marketplace? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: As it is written: “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets”</b> (Proverbs 1:20), which implies that Torah should be publicized in the streets. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: If you read</b> this verse once, <b>you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a second time</b> in greater depth; <b>and if you read</b> it <b>a second time, you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a third time;</b> and <b>if you read</b> it <b>a third time,</b> then <b>it was not</b> adequately <b>explained to you,</b> as it is clear that you do not understand it properly. |
| Proverbs 1:31 | “Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices” | Kiddushin 40a:11 | <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the following verse that deals with sinners: <b>“Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices”</b> (Proverbs 1:31)? This verse indicates that the penalty for sin goes beyond its principal, and the wicked receive additional punishments. The Gemara answers that this applies to <b>a sin that produces profits,</b> i.e., a case where there are practical consequences to one’s sin. For example, if others learn to act in a similar manner, one’s actions <b>have profits</b> with regard to punishment as well. Conversely, a sin <b>that does not produce profits does not have profits</b> as a punishment either. |
| Proverbs 2:3 | understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [ im ] you call for understanding” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed. One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with a married woman in a dream is assured that he is one</b> who has a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> He receives his place as well as that of another person in the Garden of Eden, as the married woman represents a portion belonging to someone else. However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where <b>he did not know her and was not thinking about her that evening;</b> rather, he saw an unidentified woman in his dream by chance. |
| Proverbs 2:6 | from the One to Whom wisdom belongs, as it is stated: “For the Lord gives wisdom; out of His mouth comes knowledge and discernment” | Niddah 70b:10 | The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua <b>three matters of behavior: What</b> should <b>a person do to become wise?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>increase</b> his time spent <b>sitting</b> in the study house <b>and minimize</b> his dealings <b>in merchandise.</b> The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them</b> to acquire wisdom. Rabbi Yehoshua responded: <b>Rather, they should pray for mercy</b> to receive wisdom <b>from the One to Whom wisdom belongs, as it is stated: “For the Lord gives wisdom; out of His mouth comes knowledge and discernment”</b> (Proverbs 2:6). |
| Proverbs 2:11 | “From lewdness [ mezimma ] it shall watch over you; discernment shall guard you” | Avodah Zarah17b:2 | One <b>said to</b> the other: <b>From where did you know this,</b> that the prostitutes would retreat from us in embarrassment? <b>He said to him:</b> It is written: <b>“From lewdness [<i>mezimma</i>] it shall watch over you; discernment shall guard you”</b> (Proverbs 2:11), i.e., the Torah will serve as a safeguard against lewdness. |
| Proverbs 2:19 | “None that go to her return, neither do they attain the paths of life” | Avodah Zarah17a:8 | The following verse in Proverbs makes reference to a foreign woman, which according to the Sages is a euphemism for heresy: <b>“None that go to her return, neither do they attain the paths of life”</b> (Proverbs 2:19). The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> those that are drawn to heresy <b>do not return,</b> from <b>where would they attain</b> the path of life? Why is it necessary for the verse to add that they do not attain the paths of life? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> In general, those who go to her do not return, <b>and</b> even <b>if they return, they do not attain the paths of life,</b> i.e., the pain of their regret will shorten their lives. |
| Proverbs 2:20 | “That you may walk in the way of good men” | Bava Metzia83a:10 | The Gemara relates an incident involving <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥanan: Certain porters broke his barrel of wine</b> after he had hired them to transport the barrels. <b>He took their cloaks</b> as payment for the lost wine. <b>They came and told Rav.</b> Rav <b>said</b> to Rabba bar bar Ḥanan: <b>Give them their cloaks.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥanan <b>said to him:</b> Is <b>this the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav <b>said to him: Yes,</b> as it is written: <b>“That you may walk in the way of good men”</b> (Proverbs 2:20). Rabba bar bar Ḥanan <b>gave them their cloaks.</b> The porters <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>We are poor people and we toiled all day and we are hungry and we have nothing.</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥanan: <b>Go</b> and <b>give</b> them <b>their wages.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥanan <b>said to him:</b> Is <b>this the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav <b>said to him: Yes,</b> as it is written: <b>“And keep the paths of the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 2:20). |
| Proverbs 3:2 | “For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to you” | Yoma 71a:17 | The verse states: <b>“For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to you”</b> (Proverbs 3:2). The Gemara asks: <b>Are there years of life and years that are not of life?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> “Years of life” refers to good years. As such, <b>these</b> additional years of life referred to in the verse are the <b>years of a person’s life which are transformed for him from bad to good.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:6 | Torah are dependent? “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths” | Berakhot 63a:13 | <b>Bar Kappara taught: Which is a brief passage upon which all fundamental</b> principles of <b>Torah are dependent? “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths”</b> (Proverbs 3:6). <b>Rava said:</b> One must apply this principle <b>even to acts of transgression,</b> as even then one must adhere to God and refrain from sinning excessively. |
| Proverbs 3:8 | as it is stated: “It shall be health to your navel” | Eruvin 54a:7 | <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his head should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “For they shall be a graceful wreath for your head.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his throat should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And chains about your neck.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his intestines should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his bones should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And marrow to your bones”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his entire body should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And health to all their flesh”</b> (Proverbs 4:22). |
| Proverbs 3:8 | and it says: “It shall be health to your navel” | Taanit 7a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Bena’a would say: Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18), <b>and it says: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8), <b>and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). <b>And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake,</b> e.g., for self-aggrandizement, his Torah <b>will be an elixir of death for him, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain,” and <i>arifa</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [<i>arefu</i>] there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). |
| Proverbs 3:9 | and it is stated elsewhere: “Honor the Lord with your wealth” | Bava Metzia32a:16 | The Gemara answers that the derivation from “You shall observe My <i>Shabbatot</i>; I am the Lord” <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since honoring one’s father and mother is equated to the honor of the Omnipresent, as it is stated here: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:12), <b>and it is stated elsewhere: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), <b>therefore,</b> one might have thought that the priest must <b>obey his</b> father’s command to become impure. Therefore the Torah <b>teaches us that</b> the priest is commanded <b>not to listen to him.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:9 | and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth” | Kiddushin 30b:18 | <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9). In this manner, <b>the verse equates the honor of one’s father and mother to the honor of the Omnipresent,</b> as the term “honor” is used in both cases. |
| Proverbs 3:9 | and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth” | Kiddushin 32a:2 | <b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), which teaches the following verbal analogy: <b>Just as there</b> one honors God “with your wealth,” i.e., <b>through monetary loss, so too here</b> one must honor his father <b>through monetary loss. And if you say</b> that one honors him <b>from</b> the money of <b>the father, what difference</b> does it make <b>to</b> the son, i.e., what monetary loss does he suffer? The Gemara answers: It makes a difference to him with regard <b>to</b> the <b>neglect of</b> his <b>work.</b> Although he is not required to spend his own money, the son must leave aside his work to honor his father, which will cause him some financial loss. |
| Proverbs 3:10 | But isn’t it written: “And your vats shall overflow with tirosh ” | Yoma 76b:4 | The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it written: “And your vats shall overflow with <i>tirosh</i>”</b> (Proverbs 3:10). This description implies that <i>tirosh</i> is wine rather than sweet grapes. The Gemara answers: This too is not a proof that <i>tirosh</i> means wine. We could say that <b>the vats shall overflow with something that comes from <i>tirosh</i>,</b> i.e., wine; yet <i>tirosh</i> itself means sweet fruits. |
| Proverbs 3:11 | Rabbi Asi said: For the verse states: “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, | Megillah 31b:6 | § The mishna states: <b>On fast days</b> the congregation reads the portion of <b>blessings and curses</b> (Leviticus, chapter 16), <b>and one may not interrupt</b> the reading of the <b>curses</b> by having two different people read them. Rather, one person reads all of them. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? Why does one not interrupt the reading of the curses? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said: For the verse states: “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,</b> nor be weary of His correction” (Proverbs 3:11). If one makes a break in the middle of the curses, it appears as if he loathes rebuke. |
| Proverbs 3:12 | he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, | Berakhot 5a:10 | <b>And if he did attribute</b> his suffering to dereliction in the study of Torah, <b>and did not find</b> this to be so, <b>he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes,</b> as does a father the son in whom he delights” (Proverbs 3:12). |
| Proverbs 3:15 | as the verse states: “She is more precious than rubies [ mipeninim ]” | Horayot 13a:20 | The mishna teaches: <b>When</b> do these <i>halakhot</i> of precedence take effect? In circumstances <b>when they are all equal</b> in terms of wisdom. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “She is more precious than rubies [<i>mipeninim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 3:15). The Torah is more precious <b>than</b> the <b>High Priest who enters the innermost sanctum [<i>lifnai velifnim</i>],</b> the Holy of Holies. |
| Proverbs 3:15 | “She is more precious than rubies; and all of your desires are not to be compared to her” | Moed Katan9b:2 | The two scholars, Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>once again sat and raised the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> In one place <b>it is written</b> in praise of the Torah: <b>“She is more precious than rubies; and all of your desires are not to be compared to her”</b> (Proverbs 3:15). One can infer from here that all human desires cannot be compared to the Torah, <b>but the desires of Heaven,</b> i.e., mitzvot, <b>can</b> indeed <b>be compared to her. And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written:</b> “For wisdom is better than rubies; <b>and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it”</b> (Proverbs 8:11), which indicates that even mitzvot cannot be compared to the Torah. |
| Proverbs 3:15 | studied Torah, about which it is written: “She is more precious than rubies [ peninim ]” | Sotah 4b:9 | <b>Rava said: This</b> phrase: <b>“The precious life,”</b> is not how the verse would present this idea. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>An arrogant life. And further, it should have</b> stated: A precious life, <b>she hunts</b> for the adulteress, indicating that the precious soul will entrap the adulteress, and not vice versa, as the verse indicates as written. <b>Rather, Rava says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress, even</b> if that man <b>studied Torah, about which it is written: “She is more precious than rubies [<i>peninim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 3:15), which, based on its etymological connection with the Hebrew term for the Holy of Holies, <i>lifnai velifnim</i>, is interpreted by the Sages to mean that one who studies Torah is more precious <b>than a High Priest, who enters the innermost sanctum,</b> still, <b>this</b> transgression of adultery <b>will entrap him into the judgment of Gehenna,</b> and the Torah he studied will not be able to save him. |
| Proverbs 3:16 | “Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor” | Bava Batra25b:8 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who wishes to become wise should face south, and</b> one who wishes <b>to become wealthy should face north. And your mnemonic</b> for this is that in the Temple the <b>Table,</b> which symbolized blessing and abundance, <b>was in the north, and the Candelabrum,</b> which symbolized the light of wisdom, <b>was in the south</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One should always face south, as once he becomes wise he will</b> subsequently also <b>become wealthy, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:16). |
| Proverbs 3:16 | that which is written, “Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand are riches and honor” | Shabbat 63a:18 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: They are rewarded with the matters stated with regard to the right</b> hand <b>of the Torah. As Rava bar Rav Sheila said and some say Rav Yosef bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written, “Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand are riches and honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:16)? Is that to say, <b>however,</b> that <b>in her right</b> there <b>is length of days, but there are not riches and honor? Rather,</b> it means: <b>Those who relate to it with the</b> skilled <b>right</b> hand, i.e., who study Torah for its own sake and with proper intentions, <b>there is length of days and all the more so riches and honor</b> for them. Whereas, <b>those who relate to it with the</b> unskilled <b>left</b> hand, <b>there are riches and honor; there is not length of days.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:17 | The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah | Berakhot 8a:4 | <b>That</b> last proof <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not despise the prayer of the masses? As it is stated: “Behold, God does not despise the mighty,” and it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me;</b> for there were many with me.” Rabbi Natan interprets this not as David speaking about himself, but as God speaking to Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, which is called peace in the verse: “All its ways are peace” (Proverbs 3:17); <b>and in acts of kindness, and prays with the congregation, I ascribe to him</b> credit <b>as if he redeemed Me and My children from among the nations of the world.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:17 | on account of the ways of peace, as it is written: “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” | Gittin 59b:11 | Abaye objected: Aren’t the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the entire Torah also</b> given <b>on account of the ways of peace, as it is written: “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17)? Consequently, this <i>halakha</i> is no different from the other <i>halakhot</i> in the Torah, all of which were given to increase pleasantness and tranquility in the world. |
| Proverbs 3:17 | and it states: “Its ways are ways of pleasantness, | Nedarim 62a:8 | <b>Rather, learn out of love,</b> as the verse states: “To love the Lord your God.” <b>And the honor will eventually come</b> of its own accord, <b>as it is stated: “Bind them upon your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3), <b>and it states: “Its ways are ways of pleasantness,</b> and all its paths are peace” (Proverbs 3:17), <b>and it states: “It is a tree of life to those who grasp it; happy is everyone who holds it fast”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). Consequently, one who studies in order to master Torah for its own sake, as reflected in the verse “bind them upon your fingers,” will eventually merit pleasantness, peace, and happiness. |
| Proverbs 3:17 | “Its way are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace” | Sukkah 32a:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> the verse is referring to <b>the branch of the date palm [<i>kufra</i>]</b> that has not yet hardened completely and could still be bound, albeit with difficulty. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>it is written</b> in praise of the Torah: <b>“Its way are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). At that stage of development, some of the leaves are thorns that potentially wound. The Torah would not command to use that type of branch in fulfilling the mitzva. |
| Proverbs 3:17 | “Its ways are ways of pleasantness” | Sukkah 32b:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> the verse is referring to <b>oleander,</b> which has both characteristics. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is written with regard to the Torah: <b>“Its ways are ways of pleasantness”</b> (Proverbs 3:17), <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case with the oleander tree, because it is a poisonous plant and its sharp, thorn-like leaves pierce the hand of one holding it. <b>Rava said:</b> The unfitness of the oleander is derived <b>from here: “Love truth and peace”</b> (Zechariah 8:19), and poisonous plants that pierce are antithetical to peace. |
| Proverbs 3:17 | “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” | Yevamot 15a:5 | The Gemara elaborates: If you say <b>let them perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, they will be repulsive to their husbands,</b> as it will seem to the husband that the woman he has been living with for some time suddenly requires a permit for marriage. <b>And if you would say, let them be repulsive</b> to their husbands, as that is not our concern, this is not the case, as the Torah says: <b>“Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). |
| Proverbs 3:17 | The verse states: “Her ways are the ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” | Yevamot 87b:4 | <b>The verse states: “Her ways are the ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). In other words, since the ways of Torah are those of pleasantness, the Torah would not obligate a woman who has married in the meantime to subsequently perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, as this might demean her in her husband’s eyes. |
| Proverbs 3:18 | nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them that lay hold of it” | Arakhin 15b:16 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says: What is the remedy for those who speak malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah, as it is stated: “A soothing tongue is a tree of life,</b> but its perverseness is a broken spirit” (Proverbs 15:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tongue”</b> means <b>nothing other than malicious speech, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow;</b> it speaks deceit” (Jeremiah 9:7). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tree”</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them that lay hold of it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18). <b>And if he is an ignoramus,</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated: “Its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). In other words, one who perverts his tongue with malicious speech should remedy his behavior by cultivating a broken and humble spirit. |
| Proverbs 3:18 | and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it, | Berakhot 32b:9 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:18 | Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Why are Torah matters likened to a tree, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it” | Taanit 7a:12 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Why are Torah matters likened to a tree, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18)? This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a small</b> piece of <b>wood can ignite a large piece, so too, minor Torah scholars can sharpen great</b> Torah scholars and enable them to advance in their studies. <b>And this is what Rabbi Ḥanina said: I have learned much from my teachers and even more from my friends, but from my students</b> I have learned <b>more than</b> from <b>all of them.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:18 | will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it” | Taanit 7a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Bena’a would say: Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18), <b>and it says: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8), <b>and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). <b>And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake,</b> e.g., for self-aggrandizement, his Torah <b>will be an elixir of death for him, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain,” and <i>arifa</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [<i>arefu</i>] there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). |
| Proverbs 3:19 | “The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens” | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20). We see that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, the qualities with which the heavens and earth were created, are all found in Bezalel. |
| Proverbs 3:19 | through wisdom and through understanding, as it is written: “The Lord founded earth with wisdom, and established the heavens with understanding” | Chagigah 12a:14 | Scriptural proof is provided for this statement as follows: It was created <b>through wisdom and through understanding, as it is written: “The Lord founded earth with wisdom, and established the heavens with understanding”</b> (Proverbs 3:19); <b>through knowledge, as it is written: “With His knowledge the depths were broken up”</b> (Proverbs 3:20); <b>through strength and through might, as it is written: “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, who is girded about with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7); <b>through rebuke, as it is written: “The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His rebuke”</b> (Job 26:11); <b>through righteousness and justice, as it is written: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15); <b>through kindness and mercy, as it is written: “Remember Your mercies, O Lord, and Your kindnesses, for they are from times of old”</b> (Psalms 25:6). |
| Proverbs 3:20 | and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up | Berakhot 55a:13 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Bezalel knew</b> how <b>to join</b> the <b>letters with which heaven and earth were created.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here</b> in praise of Bezalel: <b>“And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</b> and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to creation of heaven and earth: <b>“The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens”</b> (Proverbs 3:19), <b>and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up</b> and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20).

| Proverbs 3:27 | it is written like this: “Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it” | Bava Kamma81b:20 | <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one’s produce was completely</b> harvested <b>from the field, but he does not allow people to enter into his field</b> to shorten their route, <b>what do people say about him?</b> They say: <b>What benefit does so-and-so have</b> by denying entry into his field? <b>And what harm are people causing him</b> by traversing his field? <b>Concerning him, the verse says: Do not be called wicked</b> by refraining <b>from being good.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is it</b> really <b>written: Do not be called wicked</b> by refraining <b>from being good?</b> There is no such verse in the Bible. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> an idea <b>like this</b> is found in the Bible, albeit in a slightly different form, as <b>it is written like this: “Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it”</b> (Proverbs 3:27). |
| Proverbs 3:27 | “Do not withhold good from him to whom it is due, | Bava Metzia76a:9 | <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>actually,</b> we are dealing with <b>an employer who said to</b> the middleman: Hire laborers <b>for four, and he went and told them</b> that they were hired <b>for three. And</b> as for <b>that which you said:</b> Why should they have a grievance against him, as <b>they knew and accepted</b> these terms? Although they agreed to those terms, they still have a grievance, <b>as they</b> can <b>say to</b> the one who came to terms with them: <b>Don’t you have</b> respect for the verse: <b>“Do not withhold good from him to whom it is due,</b> when it is in the power of your hand to do it” (Proverbs 3:27)? |
| Proverbs 3:28 | “Do not say to your neighbor: Go and come again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you” | Bava Metzia110b:16 | The Gemara asks: <b>From that</b> point <b>forward, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav said:</b> Although one no longer transgresses the prohibition of delaying payment of wages, one <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: Do not delay,</b> by delaying his wages. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“Do not say to your neighbor: Go and come again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you”</b> (Proverbs 3:28). |
| Proverbs 3:29 | “Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you” | Gittin 90a:14 | <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to Rava: If he intends to divorce her and she is living with him and serving him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rava <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about</b> such a person: <b>“Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you”</b> (Proverbs 3:29). |
| Proverbs 3:29 | his intention is to divorce her, because it is stated: “Do not devise evil against your neighbor, as he dwells securely with you” | Yevamot 37b:10 | The Gemara cites an additional statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A man should not marry his wife</b> when at the same time <b>his intention is to divorce her, because it is stated: “Do not devise evil against your neighbor, as he dwells securely with you”</b> (Proverbs 3:29). It is wrong for one to intend to undermine the feelings of security that another has with him. |
| Proverbs 3:33 | which is written: “The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the habitation of the just” | Sanhedrin 94b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the habitation of the just”</b> (Proverbs 3:33)? <b>“The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked”; this is</b> a reference to <b>Pekah, son of Remaliah, who would eat forty <i>se’a</i> of fledglings for dessert</b> and would still not be satiated, as his property was cursed. <b>“But He blesses the habitation of the just”; this is</b> a reference to <b>Hezekiah, king of Judea, who would eat a <i>litra</i> of vegetables at</b> his <b>meal</b> and was satiated, as his property was blessed. |
| Proverbs 3:34 | which is written: “If it concerns the scornful, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace” | Avodah Zarah55a:10 | <b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scornful, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? One who <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become impure,</b> i.e., to sin, <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>provide him with an opening</b> to do so, and he is not prevented from sinning. If one <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become purified,</b> not only is he allowed to do so, but <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>assist him.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:34 | from the Writings, as it is written: “If one seeks the cynics, He will cause him to join the cynics, but to the humble He will give grace” | Makkot 10b:6 | One learns this <b>from the Torah, as it is written</b> that initially God said to Balaam with regard to the contingent dispatched by Balak: <b>“You shall not go with them”</b> (Numbers 22:12). After Balaam implored Him and indicated his desire to go with them, <b>it is written: “Arise, go with them”</b> (Numbers 22:20). One learns this <b>from the Prophets, as it is written: “I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you for your profit, Who leads you on the path that you go”</b> (Isaiah 48:17), indicating that along the path that one seeks to go, God will direct him. One learns this <b>from the Writings, as it is written: “If one seeks the cynics, He will cause him to join the cynics, but to the humble He will give grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34), indicating that if one chooses cynicism God will direct him there and if he opts for humility God will grant him grace. |
| Proverbs 3:34 | which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace” | Menachot 29b:12 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him enter through that</b> same way that he left? The Gemara answers: That would <b>not be effective,</b> since one requires assistance from Heaven in order to repent, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? Concerning one who <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become pure, he is assisted</b> from Heaven, as it is written: “But to the humble He gives grace.” Concerning one who <b>comes to become impure, he is provided with an opening</b> to do so. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that the letter <i>heh</i> <b>has a crown</b> on its roof? The Gemara answers: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: If</b> a sinner <b>returns,</b> repenting for his sin, <b>I tie</b> a crown <b>for him</b> from above. |
| Proverbs 3:34 | that which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, and unto the humble He gives grace” | Shabbat 104a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>Let him enter through that</b> opening, as the <i>kuf</i> is open on both sides at the bottom. The Gemara answers: This <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, and unto the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? One who <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become impure,</b> i.e., to sin, <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>provide him with an opening</b> to do so, and he is not prevented from sinning. However, if he <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become purified,</b> not only is he allowed to do so, but <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>assist him.</b> |
| Proverbs 3:34 | which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace” | Yoma 38b:16 | <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? If one <b>comes to impurify, they open</b> before him the opportunity to exercise his free will and do as he pleases. If one <b>comes to purify, they assist him.</b> In <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught</b> with regard to this verse: This is <b>comparable to</b> the case of <b>a man who was selling</b> both crude <b>naphtha [<i>neft</i>],</b> whose odor is vile, and <b>balsam,</b> whose fragrance is pleasant. |
| Proverbs 3:35 | It is written here “honor,” and it is written there: “The wise shall inherit honor” | Bava Batra10a:1 | “He who pursues charity and mercy, <b>finds life”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), and with regard to wisdom it is written: “He who finds Me, finds life” (Proverbs 8:35). <b>Masters of wealth, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy finds <b>charity,”</b> meaning he will be able to give charity. <b>Masters of <i>aggada</i>, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy, finds <b>honor.”</b> And how do we know that this refers to masters of <i>aggada</i>? <b>It is written here “honor,” and it is written there: “The wise shall inherit honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:35). |
| Proverbs 4:2 | nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion; My Torah, do not abandon it” | Avodah Zarah19b:10 | The psalm continues: <b>“Depart from evil, and do good;</b> seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15). The Gemara explains: <b>Lest one say: I have kept my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile, I will</b> therefore <b>go and indulge in sleep.</b> To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states: “Depart from evil, and do good,”</b> i.e., it is not enough to avoid evil, but one must actively do good. And the word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion; My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). |
| Proverbs 4:2 | Tova , that is Torah, as it says: “For I have given you good [ tov ] teachings, | Berakhot 48b:12 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> Proof for a blessing over the Torah from a different verse <b>is not necessary, as it says:</b> “For the good [<i>hatova</i>] land.” Two different matters are derived from different aspects of the word <i>hatova</i>: <b><i>Tova</i>, that is Torah, as it says: “For I have given you good [<i>tov</i>] teachings,</b> do not forsake My Torah” (Proverbs 4:2); <b><i>hatova</i>, that is the building of Jerusalem, as it says: “This good mountain [<i>hatov</i>] and Lebanon.”</b> |
| Proverbs 4:2 | nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it” | Berakhot 5a:7 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren,</b> who learn only the Written Torah, <b>know this</b> concept <b>as it is stated: “And He said you shall surely hear the voice of the Lord your God, and what is upright in His eyes you shall do and you shall listen to His mitzvot and guard His statutes; any disease that I have placed upon Egypt I will not place upon you for I am the Lord your healer”</b> (Exodus 15:26). <b>Rather,</b> one must interpret the verse: <b>Anyone who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>yet does not engage</b> in that study, not only does <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> fail to protect him, but He <b>brings upon him hideous afflictions,</b> that embarrass him <b>and trouble him, as it is stated: “I was mute with silence; I was silent from good, and my pain was strong”</b> (Psalms 39:3). The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.” |
| Proverbs 4:2 | “For I give you a good doctrine; | Menachot 53b:3 | Rabbi Ezra stated another, similar homily: <b>Let the good one come and receive the good from the Good for the good ones.</b> He explained: <b>Let the good one come; this</b> good <b>is Moses, as it is written</b> about him: <b>“And when she saw him that he was a goodly child”</b> (Exodus 2:2). <b>And receive the good; this</b> good <b>is</b> the <b>Torah, as it is written</b> about the Torah: <b>“For I give you a good doctrine;</b> do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2). <b>From the Good; this is</b> referring to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord is good to all”</b> (Psalms 145:9). <b>For the good ones; these</b> good ones <b>are the Jews, as it is written</b> with regard to them: <b>“Do good, Lord, to the good ones”</b> (Psalms 125:4). |
| Proverbs 4:2 | Torah, as it is stated: “For I give you good doctrine [ lekaḥ ]; do not forsake My Torah” | Taanit 7a:3 | Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said: The day of the rains is as great as the day</b> on which <b>the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine [<i>likḥi</i>] shall drop as the rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:2), <b>and <i>lekaḥ</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “For I give you good doctrine [<i>lekaḥ</i>]; do not forsake My Torah”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). <b>Rava said:</b> Rainfall is even <b>greater than the day on which the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain,”</b> and when one makes a comparison, <b>which</b> object <b>is</b> made <b>dependent upon which? You must say</b> that <b>the lesser</b> object <b>is dependent upon the greater</b> one. If Torah is compared to rain, it follows that rain is greater than Torah. |
| Proverbs 4:4 | as it is stated: “And He taught me and said to me: Let your heart hold fast My words; keep My commandments, and live” | Niddah 30b:21 | <b>And</b> a fetus <b>is taught the entire Torah</b> while in the womb, <b>as it is stated: “And He taught me and said to me: Let your heart hold fast My words; keep My commandments, and live”</b> (Proverbs 4:4). <b>And it</b> also <b>states:</b> “As I was in the days of my youth, <b>when the converse of God was upon my tent”</b> (Job 29:4). |
| Proverbs 4:7 | The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [ kaneh ] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [ kene ] wisdom” | Berakhot 56b:14 | <b>The Sages teach: One who sees a reed [<i>kaneh</i>] in a dream should expect wisdom, as it is stated: “Get [<i>kene</i>] wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). One who sees several <b>reeds [<i>kanim</i>] should expect understanding, as it said: “Yea, with all your acquisitions [<i>kinyanekha</i>] acquire understanding”</b> (Proverbs 4:7). <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Pumpkin [<i>kara</i>], heart of palm [<i>kura</i>], wax [<i>kira</i>], and reed [<i>kanya</i>], are all advantageous when one dreams</b> about them. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A pumpkin is only shown</b> in a dream <b>to one who fears Heaven with all his might,</b> because pumpkins <b>[<i>delu’im</i>]</b> are interpreted as an acronym for <i>dalu einai lamarom</i>, “My eyes were raised on high” (Isaiah 38:14). |
| Proverbs 4:8 | not you who honors me; rather, the Torah honors me, as it is written: “Extol her and she will exalt you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her” | Berakhot 48a:5 | The Gemara relates: <b>King Yannai and the queen ate bread together. And since</b> Yannai <b>executed the Sages, there was no one to recite the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing on their behalf. He said to his wife: Who will provide us</b> with <b>a man to recite the blessing on our behalf? She said to him: Swear to me that if I bring you</b> such <b>a man, you will not harass him. He swore,</b> and <b>she brought her brother, Shimon ben Shataḥ. She sat him between</b> the King’s throne <b>and hers.</b> The King <b>said to him: Do you see how much honor I am according you? He responded:</b> It is <b>not you who honors me; rather, the Torah honors me, as it is written: “Extol her and she will exalt you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). Yannai <b>said to</b> his wife: <b>You see that he does not accept authority.</b> |
| Proverbs 4:8 | “Extol her [ salseleha ] and she will exalt you” | Nazir 3a:4 | The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that the word <i>mesalsel</i> is referring to the study of <b>Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to Torah: <b>“Extol her [<i>salseleha</i>] and she will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> the case is <b>where he was holding his hair</b> at the time of his pronouncement. |
| Proverbs 4:8 | “ Salseleha and it will exalt you” | Rosh Hashanah26b:4 | <b>The Sages also did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>salseleha</i> in the verse: <b>“<i>Salseleha</i> and it will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to a certain man who was curling his hair: How long shall you <i>mesalsel</i> your hair?</b> And from this they understood that the verse means: Turn wisdom about, and it will exalt you. |
| Proverbs 4:15 | from here: “Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on” | Yevamot 21a:10 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the prohibition of secondary forbidden relationships is learned <b>from here: “Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on”</b> (Proverbs 4:15). One must distance oneself from any prohibited act and not pass near a place of forbidden objects or situations. |
| Proverbs 4:22 | you should live a long life, as it is stated: “For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh” | Eruvin 54a:3 | The Gemara cites instructions issued by Shmuel that are similar to those of Berurya. <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Keen scholar [<i>shinnana</i>], open your mouth and read</b> from the Torah, <b>open your mouth and study</b> the Talmud, <b>in order that</b> your studies <b>should endure in you and</b> that <b>you should live a long life, as it is stated: “For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh”</b> (Proverbs 4:22). <b>Do not read: “To those who find them [<i>lemotzeihem</i>],” but</b> rather <b>“to those who express them [<i>lemotzi’eihem</i>],” with</b> their <b>mouth.</b> |
| Proverbs 4:22 | as it is stated: “And health to all their flesh” | Eruvin 54a:7 | <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his head should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “For they shall be a graceful wreath for your head.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his throat should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And chains about your neck.” One who feels</b> pain <b>in his intestines should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his bones should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And marrow to your bones”</b> (Proverbs 3:8). <b>One who feels</b> pain <b>in his entire body should engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “And health to all their flesh”</b> (Proverbs 4:22). |
| Proverbs 4:24 | “Remove from you a crooked mouth, and perverse lips put far from you” | Ketubot 22b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is a case of the testimony of two witnesses against the testimony of one witness, it should be permitted for her to remarry <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara answers that she may not remarry <i>ab initio</i> <b>due to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi, as Rav Asi said</b> that in any case of uncertainty, the verse <b>“Remove from you a crooked mouth, and perverse lips put far from you”</b> (Proverbs 4:24) applies. Although it is not a strictly prohibited action, it is, nevertheless, inappropriate. |
| Proverbs 4:24 | “Put away from yourself a twisted mouth, and perverse lips | Yevamot 24b:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why is one suspected of relations with such a woman not permitted to enter into marriage with her <b><i>ab initio</i> as well?</b> The Gemara answers: The reason for the prohibition is <b>due to</b> the following statement <b>of Rav Asi. As Rav Asi said</b> with regard to such cases: <b>“Put away from yourself a twisted mouth, and perverse lips</b> put far from you” (Proverbs 4:24). If they were to marry, they would give substance to the prior suspicions. |
| Proverbs 4:25 | “And let your eyelids look straight before you” | Megillah 18b:14 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Rabbi Meir is different, as in him is fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“And let your eyelids look straight before you”</b> (Proverbs 4:25), and with regard to this verse, <b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti: What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“and let your eyelids</b> [<b><i>afapekha</i>],”</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>“look straight</b> [<b><i>yaishiru</i></b>] <b>before you”? He said to him: This is referring to the words of the Torah,</b> which are difficult to remember exactly, <b>and with regard to which it is written: “Will you glance upon it fleetingly</b> [<b><i>hata’if</i> ],</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>with your eyes? It is already gone”</b> (Proverbs 23:5), <b>but nevertheless they remain exact</b> [<b><i>meyusharin</i></b>] in the memory of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> since he knows them all by heart. |
| Proverbs 4:26 | It is written: “Make level the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established” | Moed Katan9a:23 | Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said to his son: These</b> two <b>people,</b> Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>are men of</b> noble <b>form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> i.e., wise and learned individuals; <b>go to them so that they will bless you. He went</b> and <b>found them</b> deep in discussion, <b>raising</b> apparent <b>contradictions between verses</b> as follows: <b>It is written: “Make level the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established”</b> (Proverbs 4:26), indicating that when one has the opportunity to perform more than one mitzva, he must evaluate which of them is most important. <b>And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Lest you level out the path of life,”</b> (Proverbs 5:6), indicating that one must perform each mitzva as the opportunity arises, without considering its relative importance. |
| Proverbs 5:6 | it is written: “Lest you level out the path of life,” | Moed Katan9a:23 | Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said to his son: These</b> two <b>people,</b> Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>are men of</b> noble <b>form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> i.e., wise and learned individuals; <b>go to them so that they will bless you.

| Proverbs 5:8 | I transgressed that which is written in the Torah: | Avodah Zarah17a:3 | <b>And I derived pleasure from the statement,</b> and <b>due to this, I was arrested for heresy</b> by the authorities, because <b>I transgressed that which is written in the Torah:</b> “Remove your way far from her, and do not come near the entrance of her house” (Proverbs 5:8). <b>“Remove your way far from her,” this</b> is a reference to <b>heresy; “and do not come near the entrance of her house,” this</b> is a reference to <b>the ruling authority.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different interpretation: <b>“Remove your way far from her,” this</b> is a reference to <b>heresy and the ruling authority; “and do not come near the entrance of her house,” this</b> is a reference to <b>a prostitute. And how much</b> distance must one maintain from a prostitute? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Four cubits.</b> |
| Proverbs 5:15 | It is written: “Drink waters out of your own cistern” | Avodah Zarah19a:13 | <b>Ulla raises a contradiction</b> with regard to the following verse. <b>It is written: “Drink waters out of your own cistern”</b> (Proverbs 5:15), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And running waters out of your own well.”</b> He explains: <b>Initially</b> one should <b>“drink waters out of your own cistern,”</b> i.e., like the cistern that draws water into one location, learning all existing knowledge; <b>and ultimately</b> one can produce <b>“running waters out of your own well,”</b> i.e., original thought and innovative insights in Torah. |
| Proverbs 5:16 | it is written: “Let your springs be dispersed abroad” | Taanit 7a:14 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama raised</b> another <b>contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “Let your springs be dispersed abroad”</b> (Proverbs 5:16), whereas in the next verse <b>it is written: “Let them be your own”</b> (Proverbs 5:17). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama explains: <b>If the student</b> sitting before you <b>is worthy,</b> then <b>“Let your springs be dispersed abroad,”</b> as you should teach him, but <b>if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Let them be your own.”</b> |
| Proverbs 5:17 | it is written: “Let them be your own” | Taanit 7a:14 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama raised</b> another <b>contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “Let your springs be dispersed abroad”</b> (Proverbs 5:16), whereas in the next verse <b>it is written: “Let them be your own”</b> (Proverbs 5:17). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama explains: <b>If the student</b> sitting before you <b>is worthy,</b> then <b>“Let your springs be dispersed abroad,”</b> as you should teach him, but <b>if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Let them be your own.”</b> |
| Proverbs 5:18 | your youth” | Sanhedrin 22b:1 | <b>your youth”</b> (Proverbs 5:18). Rav Yitzḥak, his son, <b>said to him: Such as whom?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Such as your mother.</b> |
| Proverbs 5:18 | A man finds peace of mind only with his first wife, as it is stated: “Let your fountain be blessed, and have joy from the wife of your youth” | Yevamot 63b:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rav Yehuda teach Rav Yitzḥak, his son,</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man finds peace of mind only with his first wife, as it is stated: “Let your fountain be blessed, and have joy from the wife of your youth”</b> (Proverbs 5:18), <b>and</b> his son <b>said to him: For example, whom,</b> and his father responded in this case as well: <b>For example, your mother.</b> This indicates that Rav Yehuda did find peace of mind with his wife. The Gemara answers: She was aggressive and <b>forceful, but</b> she was <b>easily appeased.</b> |
| Proverbs 5:19 | that which is written: “A loving hind and a graceful roe, | Eruvin 54b:2 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A loving hind and a graceful roe,</b> let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and be you ravished always with her love” (Proverbs 5:19)? <b>Why were matters of Torah compared to a hind? To tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with <b>a hind, its womb is narrow and it is cherished by its mate each and every hour like the first hour, so</b> too, <b>matters of Torah are cherished by those who study them each and every hour like the first hour.</b> |
| Proverbs 5:19 | a loving hind and a graceful doe” | Ketubot 77b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would <b>announce: Be careful of the flies</b> found <b>on those afflicted with <i>ra’atan</i>,</b> as they are carriers of the disease. <b>Rabbi Zeira would not sit</b> in a spot where the <b>wind</b> blew from the direction of someone afflicted with <i>ra’atan</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar would not enter</b> the <b>tent</b> of one afflicted with <i>ra’atan</i>, and <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi would not eat eggs from an alley</b> in which someone afflicted with <i>ra’atan</i> lived. Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> would <b>attach himself</b> to <b>them and study Torah, saying</b> as justification the verse: “The Torah is <b>a loving hind and a graceful doe”</b> (Proverbs 5:19). <b>If</b> it <b>bestows grace on those who learn it,</b> does <b>it not protect</b> them from illness? |
| Proverbs 5:23 | Rabbi Ami says: Doeg died only when he forgot what he learned, as it is stated: “He shall die for want of instruction, and in his folly he shall go astray” | Sanhedrin 106b:16 | <b>Rabbi Ami says: Doeg died only when he forgot what he learned, as it is stated: “He shall die for want of instruction, and in his folly he shall go astray”</b> (Proverbs 5:23). <b>Rav Ashi says: He was afflicted with leprosy</b> before his death, <b>as it is stated: “Those that go far from You shall perish; You destroy [<i>hitzmatta</i>] all those who go astray from You”</b> (Psalms 73:27). |
| Proverbs 6:3 | as it is written: “Go, humble yourself [ hitrapes ] and urge your neighbor” | Yoma 87a:14 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> insulted <b>Rabbi Abba,</b> causing the latter to <b>have a complaint against him.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>went and sat at the threshold</b> of <b>Rabbi Abba’s</b> house to beg him for forgiveness. <b>When</b> Rabbi Abba’s <b>maid poured out the</b> dirty <b>water</b> from the house, <b>the stream of water landed on</b> Rabbi Yirmeya’s <b>head. He said</b> about himself: <b>They have made me into a trash heap,</b> as they are pouring dirty water on me. <b>He recited</b> this verse <b>about himself: “Who lifts up the needy out of the trash heap”</b> (Psalms 113:7). <b>Rabbi Abba heard</b> what happened <b>and went out to greet him.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Now I must go out to appease you</b> for this insult, <b>as it is written: “Go, humble yourself [<i>hitrapes</i>] and urge your neighbor”</b> (Proverbs 6:3). |
| Proverbs 6:8 | from here: “She provides her bread in the summer, and gathers [ agra ] her food in the harvest” | Sanhedrin 7a:16 | The Gemara returns to analyzing the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> expression: <b>“You shall not be afraid [<i>taguru</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>is a term for gathering in,</b> so that the term may be interpreted to mean that a judge may not keep his ruling to himself? <b>Rav Naḥman said: The verse states:</b> “You shalt plant vineyards and dress them, <b>but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather [<i>te’egor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:39). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “She provides her bread in the summer, and gathers [<i>agra</i>] her food in the harvest”</b> (Proverbs 6:8). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “A wise son gathers [<i>oger</i>] in the summer”</b> (Proverbs 10:5). |
| Proverbs 6:9 | “How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?” | Sukkah 26b:4 | The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye would sleep</b> during the day <b>for</b> a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time it takes to <b>enter from Pumbedita to Bei Kuvei. Rav Yosef read</b> the following verse as <b>pertaining to</b> Abaye: <b>“How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?”</b> (Proverbs 6:9). Rav Yosef considered this dereliction in the study of Torah. |
| Proverbs 6:22 | “When you walk, it shall lead you; | Sotah 21a:6 | <b>And the Torah</b> is associated <b>with light</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun <b>protects</b> one <b>forever, so too,</b> the <b>Torah</b> one studies <b>protects</b> one <b>forever; and it states</b> in the previous verse with regard to the Torah: <b>“When you walk, it shall lead you;</b> when you lie down, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you” (Proverbs 6:22). The Gemara explains: <b>“When you walk, it shall lead you”; this is</b> referring to when one is in <b>this world. “When you lie down, it shall watch over you”; this is</b> referring to the time of <b>death,</b> when one lies in his grave. <b>“And when you awake, it shall talk with you”;</b> this is referring <b>to the time to come</b> after the resurrection of the dead. The Torah that one studies protects and guides him both in this world and in the next world. |
| Proverbs 6:23 | as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, and the Torah is light” | Bava Batra4a:3 | Herod <b>said to him: I am he. Had I known that the Sages were so cautious I would not have killed them. Now, what is that man’s remedy,</b> i.e., what can I do to repent for my sinful actions? Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: He</b> who <b>extinguished the light of the world</b> by killing the Torah Sages, <b>as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23), <b>should go and occupy himself with the light of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the Temple: <b>“And all the nations shall flow [<i>venaharu</i>] unto it”</b> (Isaiah 2:2), the word <i>venaharu</i> alluding to light [<i>nehora</i>]. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he said to him: He</b> who <b>blinded the eye of the world, as it is written</b> in reference to the Sages: <b>“And if</b> it be committed through ignorance <b>by the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Numbers 15:24), <b>should go and occupy himself with the eye of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written: “I will desecrate my Temple, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes”</b> (Ezekiel 24:21). |
| Proverbs 6:23 | The World-to-Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life” | Berakhot 5a:23 | <b>The World-to-Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). One may arrive at the lamp of mitzva and the light of Torah that exists in the World-to-Come only by means of the reproofs of instruction in this world. |
| Proverbs 6:23 | And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light” | Megillah 16b:8 | § The Gemara returns to its explanation of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor”</b> (Esther 8:16). <b>Rav Yehuda said: “Light”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that they once again studied. <b>And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>“Gladness” [<i>simḥa</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festivals</b> that they once again observed. <b>And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [<i>vesamakhta</i>] on your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>“Joy” [<i>sasson</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision,</b> as they once again circumcised their sons. <b>And similarly it says: “I rejoice [<i>sas</i>] at Your word”</b> (Psalms 119:162), which the Sages understood as referring to David’s rejoicing over the mitzva of circumcision. |
| Proverbs 6:23 | homiletically: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light” | Sotah 21a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> the <b>merit of a mitzva protect</b> one <b>so much</b> as to delay her punishment? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this</b> verse <b>homiletically: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>The verse associates the mitzva with a lamp and the Torah with</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun. <b>The mitzva</b> is associated <b>with a lamp</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as a lamp does not protect</b> one by its light extensively but <b>only temporarily,</b> while the lamp is in one’s hand, <b>so too, a mitzva protects</b> one <b>only temporarily,</b> i.e., while one is performing the mitzva. |
| Proverbs 6:23 | Torah, as it is stated: “For a mitzva is a lamp and Torah is a light” | Taanit 7b:11 | <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And now that men do not see the light, it is bright in the skies, but the wind passes and cleanses them”</b> (Job 37:21). <b>And “light”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “For a mitzva is a lamp and Torah is a light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). According to this interpretation, the verse means that when “men do not see the light,” i.e., when they are not occupied with Torah, <b>“it is bright in the skies,”</b> as there are no rainclouds. With regard to this verse, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Even when the sky is comprised of bright clouds</b> that serve <b>to bring down dew and rain,</b> no rain will fall, as <b>“the wind passes and cleanses them.”</b> |
| Proverbs 6:26 | “For on account of a prostitute a man is brought to a loaf [ kikar ] of bread” | Horayot 10b:11 | He explains: <b>“And Lot cast</b> his eyes” is an allusion to the verse: <b>“His master’s wife cast her eyes</b> upon Joseph and said: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:7). <b>“His eyes”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Samson said: Get her for me, as she is pleasing to my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3). <b>“And beheld”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And Shechem, son of Hamor,</b> the prince of the land, <b>beheld her;</b> and he took her and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). <b>“The entire plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan”</b> is an allusion to the verse: <b>“For on account of a prostitute a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). <b>“That it was well watered [<i>mashke</i>] everywhere”</b> is an allusion to the verse <b>“I will follow my lovers, givers of my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink [<i>veshikkuyai</i>]”</b> (Hosea 2:7). |
| Proverbs 6:26 | “For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf [ kikar ] of bread” | Nazir 23a:17 | Rabbi Yoḥanan continues to interpret the verse as a series of references to licentiousness. The phrase <b>“and saw”</b> is reminiscent of the verse dealing with Jacob’s daughter Dinah: <b>“And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her</b> and he took her, and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). The verse continues: <b>“All the plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan,”</b> which alludes to the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). The last part of the verse: <b>“That it was well watered everywhere,”</b> recalls: <b>“I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink”</b> (Hosea 2:7). |
| Proverbs 6:26 | “For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread” | Sotah 4a:4 | <b>Ḥanin ben Pineḥas says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that</b> a woman <b>may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into her mouth to remove a wood chip</b> from between her teeth. The Sage <b>Peleimu says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that she may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into a basket</b> in order <b>to take a loaf</b> of bread. He adds: <b>Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof</b> from a verse <b>for the matter,</b> there is <b>an allusion to the matter</b> from the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). |
| Proverbs 6:32 | as it is written: “He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding” | Sanhedrin 38a:17 | The verse states in that passage: <b>“Whoever is thoughtless, let him turn in here; as for him that lacks understanding, she tells him”</b> (Proverbs 9:4). The Gemara explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Who lured this</b> man to sin? <b>The woman told him</b> to sin. An allusion to the interpretation that one who is lured to sin by a woman is called one “that lacks understanding” is <b>as it is written: “He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding”</b> (Proverbs 6:32). |
| Proverbs 6:32 | “He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding” | Sanhedrin 99b:3 | The verse states: <b>“He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding”</b> (Proverbs 6:32). <b>Reish Lakish says: This is</b> a reference to <b>one who studies Torah intermittently,</b> who is like an adulterer, who sins with the other woman intermittently, <b>as it is stated</b> about words of Torah: <b>“For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within your belly; let them be established on your lips”</b> (Proverbs 22:18) and keep the Torah always available. |
| Proverbs 7:3 | And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart” | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Proverbs 7:3 | as it is stated: “Bind them upon your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart” | Nedarim 62a:8 | <b>Rather, learn out of love,</b> as the verse states: “To love the Lord your God.” <b>And the honor will eventually come</b> of its own accord, <b>as it is stated: “Bind them upon your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3), <b>and it states: “Its ways are ways of pleasantness,</b> and all its paths are peace” (Proverbs 3:17), <b>and it states: “It is a tree of life to those who grasp it; happy is everyone who holds it fast”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). Consequently, one who studies in order to master Torah for its own sake, as reflected in the verse “bind them upon your fingers,” will eventually merit pleasantness, peace, and happiness. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister” | Berakhot 57a:4 | <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with his mother [<i>em</i>] in a dream, he should anticipate</b> attaining <b>understanding, as it is stated: “Yea if [<i>im</i>] you call for understanding”</b> (Proverbs 2:3), and in this homiletic interpretation <i>im</i> is considered to be the equivalent of <i>em</i>. <b>One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with a betrothed young woman</b> in a dream, <b>he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance [<i>morasha</i>] of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>morasha</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>me’orasa</i>, betrothed. One who</b> sees that he <b>had relations with his sister in a dream, should anticipate wisdom, as it is stated: “Say unto wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>One who</b> sees that <b>he had relations with a married woman in a dream is assured that he is one</b> who has a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> He receives his place as well as that of another person in the Garden of Eden, as the married woman represents a portion belonging to someone else. However, the Gemara adds a caveat and says: <b>This only applies</b> in a case where <b>he did not know her and was not thinking about her that evening;</b> rather, he saw an unidentified woman in his dream by chance. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | from here: “Say to wisdom, you are my sister, and call understanding, your kinswoman [ moda ]” | Eruvin 54b:25 | <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that we learn this same idea <b>from here: “Say to wisdom, you are my sister, and call understanding, your kinswoman [<i>moda</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 7:4), which means: <b>Establish signs [<i>moda’im</i>]</b> that convey knowledge of <b>the Torah. Rava said</b> with regard to this verse: <b>Set appointed times [<i>mo’adim</i>] for Torah</b> study. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | “Say to wisdom: You are my sister, | Kiddushin 30b:1 | <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5). |
| Proverbs 7:4 | wisdom, as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” | Sanhedrin 5b:1 | It was <b>due to his</b> extraordinary <b>wisdom, as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). Therefore, calling him: My sister’s son, was an indication of his great wisdom. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | from here: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” | Sanhedrin 7b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, and some say Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor”</b> (Jeremiah 21:12)? <b>And</b> is it <b>so</b> that a court <b>may judge in the morning, and all</b> the rest of <b>the day</b> a court <b>may not judge?</b> Why does the verse specifically relate to judging in the morning? <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is: <b>If the matter is as clear to you as the morning, state</b> the verdict; <b>and if not, do not state it. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> says this principle may be derived <b>from here: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>If the matter is</b> as <b>clear to you as</b> the fact <b>that your sister is forbidden to you, state it, and if not, do not state it.</b> |
| Proverbs 7:4 | “Say to wisdom: You are my sister, | Shabbat 145b:11 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan woke up</b> due to their discussion <b>and said to them:</b> You <b>children, did I not tell you this,</b> that the verse <b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kin” (Proverbs 7:4) means that <b>if the matter is as clear to you as</b> the fact that <b>your sister is forbidden to you, say it, and if not, do not say it;</b> and these explanations that you offered are unfounded. <b>They said to him: Then will the Master tell us</b> the answers to <b>some of them?</b> He said to them: <b>Why are</b> the <b>fowl in Babylonia fatter</b> than those in Eretz Yisrael? <b>Because they were not exiled, as it says: “Moab has been at ease since his youth and he has settled on his lees,</b> and he was not emptied from vessel to vessel <b>and did not go into captivity;</b> therefore his taste remained in him and his scent did not change” (Jeremiah 48:11). Apparently, one who is not exiled retains his strength. |
| Proverbs 7:4 | “His sister”; as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” | Sotah 11a:5 | With regard to Miriam’s deed the verse states: <b>“And his sister stood afar off,</b> to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: This entire verse is stated in reference to the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., each phrase alludes to the Divine Presence watching over Moses. <b>“And</b> his sister <b>stood”; as it is written: “And the Lord came, and stood”</b> (I Samuel 3:10). <b>“His sister”; as it is written: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister”</b> (Proverbs 7:4). <b>“Afar off”; as it is written: “From afar the Lord appeared to me”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2). <b>“To know”; as it is written: “For the Lord is a God of knowledge”</b> (I Samuel 2:3). <b>“What”; as it is written: “What does the Lord God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). <b>“Would be done”; as it is written: “For the Lord God will do nothing”</b> (Amos 3:7). <b>“To him”; as it is written: “And the Lord said to him: Peace</b> be with you” (Judges 6:23). |
| Proverbs 7:9 | that this neshef is the evening? As it is written: “In the neshef , in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness” | Berakhot 3b:20 | Incidental to the Gemara’s mention of King David, other sources are cited that describe his actions. Regarding that which was cited above, that he would rise in the middle of the night in order to serve his Creator, the Gemara asks: <b>Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried,</b> I hoped for Your word” (Psalms 119:147). <b>And how</b> do we know <b>that this <i>neshef</i> is the evening? As it is written: “In the <i>neshef</i>, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness”</b> (Proverbs 7:9). Apparently, King David did indeed rise when it was still evening. |
| Proverbs 7:10 | with the attire of a harlot [ shit zona ] and wily of heart” | Shabbat 54a:1 | <b>with the attire of a harlot [<i>shit zona</i>] and wily of heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:10). <i>Sheḥuzot</i> can be interpreted as an acronym of the words <i>shit zona</i>, attire of a harlot, with the letters <i>tav</i> and <i>ḥet</i>, which are similar in form, interchanged. |
| Proverbs 7:18 | let us solace ourselves [ nitalesa ] with love” | Menachot 66b:4 | The <i>baraita</i> presents further examples of words that are interpreted as shortened terms of an expanded phrase. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; <b>let us solace ourselves [<i>nitalesa</i>] with love”</b> (Proverbs 7:18). The word <i>nitalesa</i> is short for: <b>We shall converse [<i>nissa veniten</i>] and we shall go up [<i>vena’aleh</i>]</b> to bed <b>and we shall rejoice [<i>venismaḥ</i>] and be pampered [<i>venitḥata</i>] with loves.</b> |
| Proverbs 7:19 | “For the ish is not at home; he is gone on a long journey” | Sanhedrin 96b:11 | Ammon and Moab <b>sent to him</b> that it is written: <b>“For the <i>ish</i> is not at home; he is gone on a long journey”</b> (Proverbs 7:19), <b>and <i>ish</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is an <i>ish</i> of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). Nebuchadnezzar <b>sent to them</b> in response: <b>He is in a nearby</b> location, <b>and He will come.</b> They <b>sent to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“He has gone on a journey from afar”</b> (Proverbs 7:19). Nebuchadnezzar <b>said to them: They have righteous</b> among them <b>who will pray for mercy and bring Him</b> to return. |
| Proverbs 7:20 | states: “He has taken the bag of silver with him” | Chullin 92a:18 | Rabbi Yoḥanan continues: <b>“For fifteen</b> pieces of silver”; <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>the fifteenth of Nisan,</b> the date <b>on which the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt. “Silver”; these are the righteous</b> people. <b>And similarly,</b> another verse <b>states: “He has taken the bag of silver with him”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), a reference to God taking the righteous away prior to the destruction of the First Temple (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 96b). |
| Proverbs 7:20 | “He has taken a bundle of kesef with him” | Sanhedrin 96b:12 | Ammon and Moab <b>sent to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“He has taken a bundle of <i>kesef</i> with him”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), <b>and <i>kesef</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than the righteous, as it is stated: “So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of <i>kesef</i> and for a <i>kor</i> of barley and a half-<i>kor</i> of barley”</b> (Hosea 3:2). The inference is that God acquired the congregation of Israel due to the presence of righteous people among them, and Ammon and Moab sent a message to Nebuchadnezzar that God had already taken the righteous and they no longer offered protection. |
| Proverbs 7:20 | as it is stated: “On the day of the keseh , He will come home” | Sanhedrin 96b:13 | Nebuchadnezzar <b>sent to them:</b> Perhaps <b>the wicked will repent</b> and become righteous <b>and they will pray for mercy and they will bring Him</b> to return. Ammon and Moab <b>sent to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>God already designated the time of their</b> redemption, <b>as it is stated: “On the day of the <i>keseh</i>, He will come home”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), and <b><i>keseh</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> a designated <b>time, as it is stated:</b> “Sound a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, <b>at the <i>keseh</i> on the day of our feast”</b> (Psalms 81:4). Since there is a time designated for redemption, until then you can do as you please. Nebuchadnezzar <b>sent to them: It is winter</b> now <b>and I cannot come</b> and conquer Jerusalem <b>due to the snow and the rain.</b> |
| Proverbs 7:26 | which is written: “For she has cast down [ hippila ] many wounded | Avodah Zarah19b:4 | <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For she has cast down [<i>hippila</i>] many wounded</b> and a mighty host are all her slain” (Proverbs 7:26)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>a student who has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the level where he can render <b>legal decisions, but</b> nevertheless <b>he</b> already <b>issues decisions.</b> He is like a fetus that emerged from the womb before its time, as the word <i>hippila</i> also means to miscarry. <b>“And a mighty host are all her slain”; this</b> is referring to <b>a student who has reached</b> the level where he can render <b>legal decisions,</b> referred to here as “a mighty host,” <b>but he does not issue decisions,</b> and by refraining from teaching what he knows prevents the masses from learning Torah properly. |
| Proverbs 7:26 | which is written: “For she has cast down many wounded; and a mighty host are all her slain” | Sotah 22a:13 | <b>Rabbi Abba says: This is a student who has not</b> yet <b>attained</b> the ability <b>to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, and</b> yet <b>he issues rulings</b> and is therefore compared to a prematurely born child. This is <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For she has cast down many wounded; and a mighty host are all her slain”</b> (Proverbs 7:26)? <b>“For she has cast down [<i>hippila</i>] many wounded”; this</b> is referring to <b>a Torah scholar who has not</b> yet <b>attained</b> the ability <b>to issue rulings, and</b> yet <b>he issues rulings. “And a mighty host [<i>ve’atzumim</i>] are all her slain”; this</b> is referring to <b>a Torah scholar who has attained</b> the ability <b>to issue rulings, but does not issue rulings</b> and prevents the masses from learning Torah properly. |
| Proverbs 8:2 | “In the top of high places” | Avodah Zarah19a:12 | The Gemara mentions a similar contradiction. <b>It is written</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“In the top of high places”</b> (Proverbs 8:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse that the Torah is <b>“by the path.”</b> This contradiction is resolved as follows: <b>Initially,</b> a person studies Torah in a private location, <b>in the top of high places, but ultimately</b> he will spread his knowledge, <b>by the path,</b> in the public realm. |
| Proverbs 8:4 | do I call, | Yoma 71a:18 | The verse states: <b>“To you men</b> [<b><i>ishim</i></b>] <b>do I call,</b> and my voice is to the sons of men” (Proverbs 8:4). <b>Rabbi Berekhya said:</b> The word <i>ishim</i>, although it means men, is similar to the term <i>isha</i>, woman. It may therefore be taken to refer to <b>these Torah scholars, who are similar to women</b> in that they are physically weak and are not engaged in many activities that other men are, <b>but</b> nevertheless, <b>they act mightily like men</b> when engaged in Torah study. <b>And Rabbi Berekhya said</b> further about that same verse: Nowadays <b>one who wishes to pour libations of wine over the altar should fill the throats of Torah scholars with wine, as it is stated: “To you men</b> [<b><i>ishim</i></b>] <b>do I call.”</b> The use of the phrase <i>ishim</i>, which is similar to <i>isheh</i>, used for the altar’s fire, suggests that scholars may be compared to the fire of the altar. |
| Proverbs 8:6 | which is written: “Listen, for I will speak royal things, | Shabbat 88b:3 | With regard to the revelation at Sinai, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The Lord gives the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host”</b> (Psalms 68:12)? It means that <b>each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Almighty divided into seventy languages,</b> a great host. And, similarly, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> with regard to the verse: “Behold, is My word not like fire, declares the Lord, <b>and like a hammer that shatters a rock?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>Just as this hammer breaks</b> a stone <b>into several fragments, so too, each and every utterance that emerged from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, divided into seventy languages.</b> The Gemara continues in praise of the Torah. <b>Rav Ḥananel bar Pappa said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Listen, for I will speak royal things,</b> and my lips will open with upright statements” (Proverbs 8:6)? <b>Why are matters of Torah likened to a king? To teach you</b> that <b>just as this king has</b> the power <b>to kill and to grant life, so too, matters of Torah have</b> the power <b>to kill and to grant life.</b> |
| Proverbs 8:11 | and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it” | Moed Katan9b:2 | The two scholars, Rabbi Yonatan ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehuda, son of converts, <b>once again sat and raised the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> In one place <b>it is written</b> in praise of the Torah: <b>“She is more precious than rubies; and all of your desires are not to be compared to her”</b> (Proverbs 3:15). One can infer from here that all human desires cannot be compared to the Torah, <b>but the desires of Heaven,</b> i.e., mitzvot, <b>can</b> indeed <b>be compared to her. And</b> elsewhere <b>it is written:</b> “For wisdom is better than rubies; <b>and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it”</b> (Proverbs 8:11), which indicates that even mitzvot cannot be compared to the Torah. |
| Proverbs 8:12 | as it is written: “I, wisdom, dwell with cunning” | Sotah 21b:2 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: What is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> statement? It is <b>as it is written: “I, wisdom, dwell with cunning”</b> (Proverbs 8:12), which indicates that <b>once wisdom enters into a person, cunning enters with it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer fears that the woman will use the cunning she achieves by learning the wisdom of the Torah to engage in promiscuous behavior. |
| Proverbs 8:12 | as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The matters of Torah do not endure except in one who stands naked for them, as it is stated: “I, wisdom, dwell with nakedness [ orma ]” | Sotah 21b:3 | The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with him, <b>what do they do with this</b> verse: <b>“I, wisdom,</b> dwell with cunning [<i>orma</i>]”; how do they interpret it? The Gemara responds: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> states, interpreting the word “<i>orma</i>” as nakedness rather than cunningness, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The matters of Torah do not endure except in one who stands naked for them, as it is stated: “I, wisdom, dwell with nakedness [<i>orma</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 8:12). This means that wisdom dwells only in one who is prepared to give away all of his possessions for the sake of Torah study. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The matters of Torah do not endure except in one who considers himself as one who does not</b> exist, <b>as it is stated: “But wisdom, it can be found in nothingness”</b> (Job 28:12). |
| Proverbs 8:13 | a mitzva to hate him, as it is stated: “The fear of God is to hate evil” | Pesachim 113b:6 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Not only is this permitted, it is even <b>a mitzva to hate him, as it is stated: “The fear of God is to hate evil”</b> (Proverbs 8:13). <b>Rav Aḥa, son</b> of <b>Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to</b> whether one who saw someone sin may <b>tell his teacher</b> so that <b>he</b> too <b>will hate him?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If</b> the student <b>knows</b> that he is <b>trusted by his teacher as two</b> witnesses, and therefore his statement will be accepted, <b>he</b> should <b>tell him, and if</b> he is <b>not</b> trusted by his teacher as two witnesses, he should <b>not tell him.</b> |
| Proverbs 8:15 | “Through me kings rule” | Gittin 62a:14 | § With regard to the matter of doubling one’s greeting, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda were</b> once <b>sitting</b> when the Sage <b>Geneiva passed by</b> alongside them. <b>One</b> of them <b>said to the other: We should stand before him,</b> in his honor, <b>for he is a son of Torah.</b> The other one <b>said to him: But should we stand before an argumentative person? In the meantime,</b> Geneiva <b>approached them</b> and <b>said to them: Peace be upon you, kings, peace be upon you, kings. They said to him: From where do you</b> know <b>that the Sages are called kings? He said to them: As it is written</b> with regard to the Torah in the book of Proverbs: <b>“Through me kings rule”</b> (Proverbs 8:15). |
| Proverbs 8:15 | “Through me kings will reign” | Yoma 72b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There</b> were <b>three crowns</b> on the sacred vessels in the Temple: The crown <b>of the altar, and of the Ark, and of the table.</b> The regal appearance they provided symbolized power and authority: The crown <b>of the altar</b> symbolized the crown of priesthood; <b>Aaron was deserving and took it,</b> and the priesthood continues exclusively through his descendants. The crown <b>of the table</b> symbolized the abundance and blessing associated with the crown of kingship; <b>David was deserving and took it</b> for himself and his descendants after him. The crown <b>of the Ark</b> symbolized the crown of Torah; <b>it is still sitting</b> and waiting to be acquired, <b>and anyone who wishes to take</b> it may <b>come and take</b> it and be crowned with the crown of Torah. <b>Perhaps you will say it is inferior</b> to the other two crowns and that is why nobody has taken it; therefore, <b>the verse states</b> about the wisdom of Torah: <b>“Through me kings will reign”</b> (Proverbs 8:15), indicating that the strength of the other crowns is derived from the crown of Torah, which is greater than them all. |
| Proverbs 8:21 | is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries” | Bava Batra134a:8 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>A great matter is</b> referring to the secrets of <b>the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> (see Ezekiel, chapter 1), the conduct of the transcendent universe, <b>and a small matter is,</b> for example, <i>halakhot</i> that were ultimately formulated in the framework of <b>the discussions of Abaye and Rava.</b> He did not neglect any of these disciplines, so as <b>to fulfill that</b> which <b>is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21), as Rabban Yoḥanan was filled with the disciplines of Torah and wisdom. |
| Proverbs 8:21 | in the name of Rava bar Mari: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give every righteous person 310 worlds as it is stated: “To bequeath to those who love Me substance [ yesh ]; and I will fill their treasuries” | Sanhedrin 100a:16 | Rav Dimi <b>said: What is the reason</b> that <b>you are not familiar with</b> matters of <b><i>aggada</i>? As they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rava bar Mari: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give every righteous person 310 worlds as it is stated: “To bequeath to those who love Me substance [<i>yesh</i>]; and I will fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21). <b>In</b> terms of its <b>numerical value,</b> the word <b><i>yesh</i>,</b> spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>shin</i>, <b>is 310,</b> indicating that God grants the righteous a full measure. |
| Proverbs 8:21 | to fulfill that which is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries” | Sukkah 28a:7 | The Gemara elaborates: <b>A great matter</b> is referring to the secrets of the <b>Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot,</b> the conduct of the transcendent universe. <b>A small matter</b> is, for example, <i>halakhot</i> that were ultimately formulated in the framework of <b>the disputes of Abaye and Rava.</b> He did not neglect any of these disciplines so as <b>to fulfill that which is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21), as Rabban Yoḥanan was filled with the disciplines of Torah and wisdom. <b>And if the youngest of them was so</b> prolific, <b>the greatest of them</b> was <b>all the more so</b> prolific. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>said of Yonatan ben Uzziel,</b> the greatest of Hillel’s students, <b>that when he sat and was engaged in Torah</b> study, the sanctity that he generated was so intense that <b>any bird that flew over him was immediately incinerated.</b> |
| Proverbs 8:22 | “The Lord acquired me [ kanani ] at the beginning of His way” | Kiddushin 32b:8 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand</b> and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is obligatory to stand <b>before a simple [<i>ashmai</i>] elder.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “elder,” and an “elder”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a wise man, as it is stated: “Gather unto Me seventy men of the Elders of Israel,</b> whom you know to be the Elders of the people” (Numbers 11:16). <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An “elder [<i>zaken</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>one who has acquired wisdom.</b> He interprets the word <i>zaken</i> as a contraction of the phrase <i>zeh kanna</i>, meaning: This one has acquired. Elsewhere the word <i>kanna</i> is used in reference to wisdom, <b>as it is stated</b> that wisdom says: <b>“The Lord acquired me [<i>kanani</i>] at the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). |
| Proverbs 8:22 | as it is written: “The Lord made me as the beginning of His way, | Nedarim 39b:5 | The Gemara provides sources for each of these phenomena. <b>Torah</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “The Lord made me as the beginning of His way,</b> the first of His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22). Based on the subsequent verses, this is referring to the Torah. |
| Proverbs 8:22 | as it is written: “The Lord made me as the beginning of His way, | Pesachim 54a:9 | The Gemara provides sources for the notion that each of these phenomena was created before the world was. <b>Torah</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “The Lord made me as the beginning of His way,</b> the first of His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22), which, based on the subsequent verses, is referring to the Torah. <b>Repentance</b> was created before the world was created, <b>as it is written: “Before the mountains were brought forth,</b> or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God,” <b>and it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“You return man to contrition; and You say: Repent, children of man”</b> (Psalms 90:2–3). |
| Proverbs 8:22 | Torah is one acquisition, as it is written: “The Lord acquired me as the beginning of His way” | Pesachim 87b:6 | The Gemara proceeds to enumerate all four: <b>Torah is one acquisition, as it is written: “The Lord acquired me as the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22). <b>Heaven and earth are one acquisition [<i>kinyan</i>], as it is written:</b> “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, <b>Creator [<i>koneh</i>] of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:19). <b>The Holy Temple is one acquisition, as it is written:</b> “And He brought them to His sacred border, <b>to this mountain, which His right hand had acquired”</b> (Psalms 78:54). <b>The Jewish people are one acquisition, as it is written: “The nation that You have acquired”</b> (Exodus 15:16). <b>And you,</b> Hosea, <b>said</b> that I should <b>replace them with another nation?</b> |
| Proverbs 8:26 | Eretz Yisrael was created first and the rest of the entire world was created afterward, as it is stated: “While as yet He had not made the land, nor the fields” | Taanit 10a:2 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Eretz Yisrael was created first and the rest of the entire world was created afterward, as it is stated: “While as yet He had not made the land, nor the fields”</b> (Proverbs 8:26). Here, and in the following statements, the term “land” is understood as a reference to the Land of Israel, while “the fields” means all the fields in other lands. Furthermore, <b>Eretz Yisrael is watered by the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself, and the rest of the entire world</b> is watered <b>through an intermediary, as it is stated: “Who gives rain upon the land, and sends water upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10). |
| Proverbs 8:30 | said before Him: Master of the Universe, You have a hidden treasure in which You delight every day, | Shabbat 89a:4 | <b>He went to Moses</b> and <b>said to him: The Torah that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave you, where is it?</b> Moses evaded the question and <b>said to him: And what am I that the Holy One, Blessed be He, would have given me the Torah?</b> I am unworthy. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, are you a fabricator?</b> Moses <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, You have a hidden treasure in which You delight every day,</b> as it is stated: “And I was His delight every day, playing before Him at every moment” (Proverbs 8:30). <b>Should I take credit for myself</b> and say that You gave it to me? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Since you belittled yourself,</b> the Torah <b>will be called by your name, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant</b> to whom I commanded at Horeb laws and statutes for all of Israel” (Malachi 3:22). |
| Proverbs 8:34 | “Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts” | Berakhot 8a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). |
| Proverbs 8:35 | “For whoever finds me finds life” | Berakhot 56b:7 | The Gemara continues dealing with interpretations of the details of dreams: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water”</b> (Genesis 26:19), and ultimately there was peace. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who sees a well in his dream it is a symbol that <b>he has found Torah,</b> as the well symbolizes Torah. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“For whoever finds me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35), <b>and it is written here: “A well of living water,”</b> and we see that a well is linked to Torah as both are associated with life. <b>Rava said:</b> The well in the dream symbolizes <b>actual life.</b> |
| Proverbs 8:35 | is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord” | Berakhot 8a:7 | <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). |
| Proverbs 8:35 | and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life” | Taanit 7a:5 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Bena’a would say: Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18), <b>and it says: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8), <b>and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). <b>And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake,</b> e.g., for self-aggrandizement, his Torah <b>will be an elixir of death for him, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain,” and <i>arifa</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [<i>arefu</i>] there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4). |
| Proverbs 8:36 | as it is stated: “All they who hate Me love death” | Eruvin 99a:16 | Having mentioned phlegm, the Gemara cites a related teaching: <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One who expelled <b>phlegm in front of his master</b> has acted in a disrespectful manner and is <b>liable for</b> the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated: “All they who hate Me love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36). <b>Do not read it</b> as: <b>“They who hate [<i>mesanai</i>] Me”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>“Those who make themselves hateful [<i>masniai</i>] to Me,”</b> i.e., those who make themselves hateful by such a discharge. |
| Proverbs 8:36 | as it is stated: “All those who hate me, love death” | Megillah 28a:4 | <b>Is this to say that</b> doing so <b>is</b> especially <b>virtuous? But</b> hasn’t <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any Torah scholar who</b> allows someone else <b>to bless</b> Grace after Meals <b>in his presence,</b> i.e., to lead for him, <b>even</b> if that person is <b>a High Priest who is an ignoramus,</b> then <b>that Torah scholar is liable to</b> receive the <b>death penalty</b> for belittling his own honor? This is <b>as it is stated: “All those who hate me, love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“those who hate Me [<i>mesan’ai</i>],” rather</b> read it as though it said: <b>Those who make Me hated [<i>masni’ai</i>].</b> The honor due to a Torah scholar is representative of the honor of God in the world. Therefore, by belittling his own honor, he causes others to fail to respect God, which can ultimately develop into hate. If so, why did Rabbi Perida consider his behavior to be so deserving of praise? |
| Proverbs 8:36 | as it is stated: “All those who hate me love death” | Shabbat 114a:3 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A Torah scholar on whose clothes a fat stain is found is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>as it is stated: “All those who hate me love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36), and the Sages said: <b>Do not read: Those who hate me [<i>mesanai</i>]. Rather,</b> read: <b>Those who cause me to be hated [<i>masniai</i>].</b> Those who cause people to hate the Torah by creating the impression that those who study Torah are unclean deserve the death penalty. <b>Ravina said:</b> A fat stain [<i>revav</i>] was not stated, but rather <b>a bloodstain [<i>revad</i>] was stated</b> (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), which is a greater disgrace. The Gemara adds: <b>They did not disagree</b> over the <i>halakha</i>. Rather, the dispute is whether <b>that</b> which we learned concerning stains on a Torah scholar’s clothes refers <b>to an overgarment</b> that people wear over the rest of their clothes, while <b>that</b> which we learned with regard to a bloodstain refers <b>to an undergarment,</b> where a bloodstain is disgraceful but other types of spots are not. |
| Proverbs 9:1 | seven pillars, as it is stated: “She has hewn out her seven pillars” | Chagigah 12b:3 | And the Rabbis say: The earth <b>stands on twelve pillars, as it is stated: “He set the borders of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:8). Just as the children of Israel, i.e., the sons of Jacob, are twelve in number, so does the world rest on twelve pillars. <b>And some say:</b> There are <b>seven pillars, as it is stated: “She has hewn out her seven pillars”</b> (Proverbs 9:1). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says:</b> The earth rests <b>on one pillar and a righteous person is its name, as it is stated: “But a righteous person is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). |
| Proverbs 9:1 | she carved its seven pillars” | Shabbat 116a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>According to whose</b> opinion is <b>that</b> which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said,</b> that with regard to the verse: “With wisdom she built her house, <b>she carved its seven pillars”</b> (Proverbs 9:1), <b>these are the seven books of the Torah? According to whose</b> opinion? It is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as by his count there are seven books of the Torah: Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers until: “And when the Ark traveled”; the portion: “And when the Ark traveled,” which is considered its own book; the remainder of Numbers; and Deuteronomy. |
| Proverbs 9:2 | as it is written: “She has prepared her meat, she has mixed [ maskha ] her wine” | Avodah Zarah58b:4 | § <b>Rabbi Asi asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>wine that a gentile mixed [<i>mesakho</i>]</b> with water, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Asi: <b>And</b> why not <b>say:</b> Wine that a gentile <b>diluted [<i>mezago</i>]</b> with water, as that is the term that is usually used? Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>I say</b> wine that was mixed, <b>as it is written: “She has prepared her meat, she has mixed [<i>maskha</i>] her wine”</b> (Proverbs 9:2). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Asi: While it is true that this is the language of the Bible, the <b>language of</b> the <b>Torah</b> is a language <b>in itself,</b> and the <b>language of the Sages</b> is a language <b>in itself,</b> i.e., the terminology of the Bible is not the same as the terminology employed by the Sages. |
| Proverbs 9:3 | “Upon the highest places | Avodah Zarah19a:11 | <b>Rava raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: <b>It is written</b> that the Torah calls to people: <b>“Upon the highest places</b> of the city” (Proverbs 9:3), <b>and it is written</b> far more specifically: <b>“On a seat</b> in the high places of the city” (Proverbs 9:14). He explains: <b>Initially,</b> one who studies Torah does not have a secure place to sit, and therefore he is located merely <b>upon the highest places, but ultimately,</b> as he advances in his learning, he is placed <b>on a seat</b> of honor. |
| Proverbs 9:4 | “Whoever is thoughtless, let him turn in here; as for him that lacks understanding, she tells him” | Sanhedrin 38a:17 | The verse states in that passage: <b>“Whoever is thoughtless, let him turn in here; as for him that lacks understanding, she tells him”</b> (Proverbs 9:4). The Gemara explains: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Who lured this</b> man to sin? <b>The woman told him</b> to sin. An allusion to the interpretation that one who is lured to sin by a woman is called one “that lacks understanding” is <b>as it is written: “He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding”</b> (Proverbs 6:32). |
| Proverbs 9:5 | as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled” | Berakhot 57a:22 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the <i>tanna:</i></b> You should <b>teach</b> that for <b>a Torah scholar,</b> a dream of wine is <b>always</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled”</b> (Proverbs 9:5). |
| Proverbs 9:5 | “Every support of bread”; these are masters of Talmud, as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled” | Chagigah 14a:10 | <b>“Every support of bread”; these are masters of Talmud, as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled”</b> (Proverbs 9:5). <b>“And every support of water”; these are the masters of <i>aggada</i>, who draw people’s hearts like water by</b> means of <b><i>aggada</i>. “The mighty man”; this is the master of halakhic tradition,</b> one who masters the <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to him from his rabbis. <b>“And the man of war”; this is one who knows how to engage in the discourse of Torah,</b> generating novel teachings <b>in the war of Torah. “A judge”; this is a judge who judges a true judgment truthfully. “A prophet”; as it literally indicates. “A diviner”; this is a king.</b> Why is he called a diviner? <b>For it is stated: “A divine sentence is on the lips of the king”</b> (Proverbs 16:10). <b>“An elder”; this is one fit for</b> the position of head of <b>an academy.</b> |
| Proverbs 9:8 | is stated: “Do not rebuke a scorner lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you” | Arakhin 16b:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses before me that Akiva was lashed,</b> i.e., punished, <b>many times on my account, as I would complain about him before Rabban Shimon</b> ben Gamliel <b>the Great. And all the more so I</b> thereby <b>increased</b> his <b>love</b> for me. This incident serves <b>to affirm that</b> which <b>is stated: “Do not rebuke a scorner lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you”</b> (Proverbs 9:8). A wise man wants to improve himself and loves those who assist him in that task. |
| Proverbs 9:8 | as it is stated: “Do not reprove a scorner lest he hate you; reprove a wise man and he will love you” | Yevamot 65b:6 | The Gemara cites other statements made by Rabbi Ile’a in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Just as it is a mitzva for a person to say that which will be heeded, so is it a mitzva for a person not to say that which will not be heeded.</b> One should not rebuke those who will be unreceptive to his message. <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> It is <b>obligatory</b> for him to refrain from speaking, <b>as it is stated: “Do not reprove a scorner lest he hate you; reprove a wise man and he will love you”</b> (Proverbs 9:8). |
| Proverbs 9:9 | said to him: “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser” | Bava Kamma113a:11 | <b>Rav Kahana raises a dilemma before Rav:</b> If the robber left his heirs a stolen item that is used in relative privacy, such as <b>a bed that he lies on</b> or <b>a table upon which he eats,</b> rather than something as conspicuous as a large animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the heirs obligated to return it to its owner? Rav <b>said to him: “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser”</b> (Proverbs 9:9), meaning that from the fact that the heirs must return a cow and a donkey, one can infer that they must also return a bed and a table. |
| Proverbs 9:9 | “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser” | Eruvin 65b:14 | Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer the following verse: <b>“Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser”</b> (Proverbs 9:9), i.e., it is proper to be stringent even in such a case. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the outer courtyard unless the Jews rent from the gentile. |
| Proverbs 9:9 | “Give to the wise one and he will become wiser; | Shabbat 113b:5 | The Gemara continues to discuss Shabbat. Naomi advised Ruth: <b>“And you shall bathe, and anoint yourself, and put on your robes,</b> and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking” (Ruth 3:3). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: These</b> robes <b>are Shabbat garments</b> that Naomi told her to wear in honor of the occasion. Apropos the book of Ruth, the Gemara cites additional statements of Rabbi Elazar with regard to Ruth: <b>“Give to the wise one and he will become wiser;</b> let the righteous one know and he will learn more” (Proverbs 9:9). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> refers to <b>Ruth the Moabite and Samuel of Rama,</b> who received advice and added to it with their wisdom. |
| Proverbs 9:12 | And if he scorned, the verse says about him: “If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; and if you scorn, you alone shall bear it” | Avodah Zarah18b:12 | <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if he walked</b> with the wicked, <b>he will ultimately stand</b> with them. <b>And if he stood</b> with them, <b>he will ultimately sit</b> in their company, <b>and if he sat, he will ultimately scorn</b> along with them. <b>And if he scorned, the verse says about him: “If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; and if you scorn, you alone shall bear it”</b> (Proverbs 9:12). |
| Proverbs 9:14 | “On a seat | Avodah Zarah19a:11 | <b>Rava raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: <b>It is written</b> that the Torah calls to people: <b>“Upon the highest places</b> of the city” (Proverbs 9:3), <b>and it is written</b> far more specifically: <b>“On a seat</b> in the high places of the city” (Proverbs 9:14). He explains: <b>Initially,</b> one who studies Torah does not have a secure place to sit, and therefore he is located merely <b>upon the highest places, but ultimately,</b> as he advances in his learning, he is placed <b>on a seat</b> of honor. |
| Proverbs 9:14 | on a seat | Sanhedrin 38a:16 | The verses continue: <b>“Upon the top of the highest places of the city.” Rabba bar bar Ḥana raises a contradiction:</b> It <b>is written: “Upon the top of</b> the highest places,” <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> afterward: “For she sits at the door of her house, <b>on a seat</b> in the high places of the city” (Proverbs 9:14). Is she at the top or on a seat? He explains: <b>Initially,</b> Adam was alone <b>upon the top</b> of a high place, <b>and ultimately,</b> Adam was <b>on a seat</b> that is set for a bridegroom, when Eve was paired with him. |
| Proverbs 9:17 | “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant” | Nedarim 91b:6 | The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious</b> that this is the case. What then does Rava come to teach us? The Gemara answers: Rava’s ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the man did in fact <b>commit a transgression</b> with the other man’s wife, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that he said to</b> the husband that he should not eat and saved his life is <b>because it is preferable for him that the husband should not die.</b> This is in order <b>that his wife should be to him</b> as it says in the verse: <b>“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant”</b> (Proverbs 9:17). That is to say, a person derives greater pleasure from forbidden fruit. Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern. Rather, the assumption is that he had not yet actually sinned and therefore acted in the proper manner. |
| Proverbs 9:17 | is preferable to him; as it is written: “Stolen waters are sweet | Sanhedrin 26b:23 | The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Why should he be suspected of lying in order to render a woman married? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that if he wants her for himself, <b>this</b> situation, i.e., her being married to another, <b>is preferable to him; as it is written: “Stolen waters are sweet</b> and bread eaten in secret is pleasant” (Proverbs 9:17), i.e., the forbidden is more pleasant than the permitted, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, <b>as the way</b> the woman <b>is</b> now, being unmarried, <b>she is</b> more <b>available to him.</b> He therefore is not motivated to testify falsely that she is married. |
| Proverbs 9:17 | and given to transgressors, as it is stated: “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant” | Sanhedrin 75a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the woman was unmarried, <b>let</b> the man <b>marry her.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>His mind would not have been eased</b> by marriage, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak. As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Since the day the Temple was destroyed, sexual pleasure was taken away</b> from those who engage in permitted intercourse <b>and given to transgressors, as it is stated: “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant”</b> (Proverbs 9:17). Therefore, the man could have been cured only by engaging in illicit sexual interaction. |
| Proverbs 9:17 | states: “Stolen waters are sweet | Sotah 7a:12 | The Sages <b>said to him: No, if you say</b> that this is true <b>with regard to a menstruating woman,</b> the reason he is trusted is not due to the severity of the prohibition. Rather, he is trusted <b>because she has</b> the ability to become <b>permitted</b> to her husband after her menstrual flow has ceased and she has immersed in a ritual bath. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a <i>sota</i>, who</b> potentially <b>does not have</b> the ability to become <b>permitted</b> to her husband due to her suspected adultery? <b>And</b> proof to the notion that people will more readily commit illicit acts that are permanently prohibited comes from the verse that <b>states: “Stolen waters are sweet</b> and bread eaten in secret is pleasing” (Proverbs 9:17). Consequently, there is a concern that the husband will engage in sexual intercourse with his <i>sota</i> wife if not accompanied by scholars. |
| Proverbs 9:18 | is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “But he does not know that the spirits are there; that those whom she has called are in the depths of the netherworld” | Bava Batra79a:3 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who separates himself from the matters of Torah falls into Gehenna. As it is stated: “The man who strays out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the spirits”</b> (Proverbs 21:16). “The way of understanding” is the way of the Torah. <b>And</b> one who departs from the Torah arrives in the place of the <b>spirits,</b> which <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “But he does not know that the spirits are there; that those whom she has called are in the depths of the netherworld”</b> (Proverbs 9:18). |
| Proverbs 10:2 | it is written: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but charity delivers from death” | Bava Batra10a:16 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a contradiction</b> between two texts. In one place <b>it is written: “Riches profit not on the day of wrath, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 11:4), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2). <b>Why</b> is it necessary to have <b>these two</b> verses about <b>charity,</b> that it delivers from death? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba continues: <b>One</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from an unnatural death</b> in this world, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> in the World-to-Come. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> of the verses <b>is that</b> charity <b>which delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> mentioned? It is in <b>that</b> verse <b>in which “wrath” is written, as</b> with regard to the day of judgment <b>it is written: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). <b>And which</b> type of charity <b>is that which delivers from an unnatural death?</b> |
| Proverbs 10:2 | charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death” | Rosh Hashanah16b:6 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person’s sentence is torn up on</b> account of <b>four</b> types of <b>actions. These are:</b> Giving <b>charity, crying out</b> in prayer, <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, and a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better. An allusion may be found in Scripture for all of them: Giving <b>charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2); <b>crying out</b> in prayer, <b>as it is written: “Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses”</b> (Psalms 107:28); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, as it is written:</b> “As for <b>Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be”</b> (Genesis 17:15), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her”</b> (Genesis 17:16); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better, <b>as it is written: “And God saw their deeds”</b> (Jonah 3:10), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And God repented of the evil, which He had said He would do to them, and He did not do</b> it” (Jonah 3:10). |
| Proverbs 10:2 | “And charity will save from death” | Shabbat 156b:3 | <b>Ablet stood up, threw down</b> the person’s <b>burden, and inside he found a snake cut and cast in two pieces. Shmuel said to him: What did you do</b> to merit being saved from death? The person <b>said to him: Every day we all take bread</b> together <b>and eat</b> from the bread. <b>Today, there was one of us who did not have bread,</b> and when it came time to gather the bread, <b>he was embarrassed</b> because he did not have any to give. <b>I said to</b> the others: <b>I will go and take</b> the bread. <b>When I came to</b> the person who did not have bread, <b>I rendered myself as one who was taking from him so that he would not be embarrassed.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: You performed a mitzva. Shmuel went out and taught</b> based on this incident that even though it is written: <b>“And charity will save from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2), it does <b>not</b> only mean that it will save a person <b>from an unusual death but</b> even <b>from death itself.</b> |
| Proverbs 10:2 | “And charity will save from death” | Shabbat 156b:5 | <b>Her father</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: What did you do</b> to merit being saved from the snake? She told him: <b>In the evening a poor person came and knocked on the door, and everyone was preoccupied with the feast and nobody heard him. I stood</b> and <b>took the portion that you had given me</b> and <b>gave it to him.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: You performed a mitzva,</b> and you were saved in its merit. <b>Rabbi Akiva went out and taught</b> based on this incident that even though it is written: <b>“And charity will save from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2), it does <b>not</b> mean that it will save a person only <b>from an unusual death, but</b> even <b>from death itself.</b> |
| Proverbs 10:5 | from here: “A wise son gathers [ oger ] in the summer” | Sanhedrin 7a:16 | The Gemara returns to analyzing the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> expression: <b>“You shall not be afraid [<i>taguru</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17), <b>is a term for gathering in,</b> so that the term may be interpreted to mean that a judge may not keep his ruling to himself? <b>Rav Naḥman said: The verse states:</b> “You shalt plant vineyards and dress them, <b>but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather [<i>te’egor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:39). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “She provides her bread in the summer, and gathers [<i>agra</i>] her food in the harvest”</b> (Proverbs 6:8). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> it is derived <b>from here: “A wise son gathers [<i>oger</i>] in the summer”</b> (Proverbs 10:5). |
| Proverbs 10:7 | says: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” | Taanit 28a:12 | <b>And about these</b> families who provided these donations <b>and</b> others <b>like them,</b> the verse <b>says: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7), as they are remembered for the good throughout the generations. <b>And about Jeroboam, son of Nevat, and his ilk, it is stated: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7). |
| Proverbs 10:7 | “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” | Yoma 37a:3 | § The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the priests and the people who were in the courtyard <b>respond after he</b> recites the name of God: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“When I call out the name of the Lord, give glory to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3). <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: When I mention the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, you give</b> Him <b>glory</b> and recite praises in his honor. <b>Ḥananya, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, says</b> that proof for the practice is from a different source: <b>“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7). <b>The prophet,</b> Solomon, <b>said to the Jewish people: When I mention the Righteous One of all worlds, you accord Him a blessing.</b> |
| Proverbs 10:7 | it is stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” | Yoma 38a:6 | Also, <b>Hugras ben Levi knew a chapter</b> in the art of <b>music,</b> as will be explained, <b>and he did not want to teach</b> it to others. And the scribe <b>ben Kamtzar did not want to teach</b> a special <b>act of writing.</b> He was expert at writing all four letters of a four-letter name simultaneously. <b>About the first</b> ones, who were mentioned favorably, <b>it is stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7); <b>and about these</b> who were concerned only for themselves <b>it is stated: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7). |
| Proverbs 10:7 | it is stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” | Yoma 38b:3 | <b>The Sages taught: Ben Kamtzar did not want to teach</b> others a special <b>technique of writing.</b> What was that technique? <b>They said about him that he would take four quills between his fingers, and if there was a word</b> consisting <b>of four letters</b> that he wanted to write, <b>he could write it simultaneously. They said to him: What did you see that</b> led you <b>not to teach</b> that technique? <b>All the</b> others with unique skills <b>came up</b> with <b>a response to</b> questions about the <b>matter</b> of <b>their</b> conduct, claiming that they sought to prevent their technique from being used in idol worship. However, <b>ben Kamtzar did not come up</b> with <b>a response to</b> questions about the <b>matter</b> of <b>his</b> conduct, and it was clear that his only motivation in preventing his skill from being disseminated was his own personal honor. <b>With regard to the first</b> people listed, <b>it is stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7); <b>and about ben Kamtzar and his counterparts it is stated: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7). |
| Proverbs 10:8 | mitzvot, as it is stated: “The wise in heart will take mitzvot” | Sotah 13a:13 | § It states further in the mishna: <b>Who, to us,</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Joseph,</b> as it was none other than Moses who involved himself in transporting his coffin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (4:6–7): <b>Come and see how beloved mitzvot are to Moses our teacher. As,</b> at the time of the Exodus, <b>all the Jewish people were involved in</b> taking <b>the plunder</b> from Egypt, <b>and he was involved in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot, as it is stated: “The wise in heart will take mitzvot”</b> (Proverbs 10:8). |
| Proverbs 10:18 | “And he who utters slander is a fool” | Pesachim 3b:13 | The Gemara relates another incident in praise of one who is careful to refrain from improper or negative language. <b>Rav Kahana fell ill, and the Sages sent Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi,</b> as their emissary to him. <b>They said to him: Go</b> and <b>assess what is</b> Rav Kahana’s <b>condition</b> at present. Rabbi Yehoshua, son <b>of</b> Rav Idi, <b>went and found that</b> Rav Kahana <b>had passed away. He rent his garment and turned</b> his garment around so <b>the tear</b> would be <b>behind him</b> and would not be immediately apparent, <b>and he was crying</b> as he <b>was coming. They said to him: Did</b> Rav Kahana <b>pass away? He said to them: I did not say</b> that, as the verse states: <b>“And he who utters slander is a fool”</b> (Proverbs 10:18). This verse indicates that it is undesirable to be a bearer of bad tidings, and if one must inform others of the unfortunate news, he should do so in an indirect manner. |
| Proverbs 10:25 | on one pillar and a righteous person is its name, as it is stated: “But a righteous person is the foundation of the world” | Chagigah 12b:3 | And the Rabbis say: The earth <b>stands on twelve pillars, as it is stated: “He set the borders of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:8). Just as the children of Israel, i.e., the sons of Jacob, are twelve in number, so does the world rest on twelve pillars. <b>And some say:</b> There are <b>seven pillars, as it is stated: “She has hewn out her seven pillars”</b> (Proverbs 9:1). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says:</b> The earth rests <b>on one pillar and a righteous person is its name, as it is stated: “But a righteous person is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). |
| Proverbs 10:25 | “And a righteous man is the foundation of the world” | Gittin 61a:4 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana was</b> once <b>walking to</b> the city of <b>Huzal</b> when <b>he saw a certain man who was throwing sticks</b> at a palm tree <b>and dates were falling</b> to the ground. Rav Kahana <b>went, gathered</b> up some of the dates, <b>and ate</b> them. That man <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>See, Master, that I threw them</b> down <b>with my hand,</b> i.e., the dates were already in my hand, and therefore they are legally mine. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: You are from the place of Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> who was a great Sage in the city of Huzal. For that reason, you are knowledgeable in <i>halakha</i>. Rav Kahana <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Yoshiya: <b>“And a righteous man is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). Even after his death, Rabbi Yoshiya left a foundation for the world, as his city continued to be a center of Torah study. |
| Proverbs 10:25 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even for one righteous person the world exists, as it is stated: “But the righteous is the foundation of the world” | Yoma 38b:14 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even for one righteous person the world exists, as it is stated: “But the righteous is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya himself said:</b> The proof is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“He will keep the feet of His pious ones”</b> (I Samuel 2:9), meaning that God maintains the world due to the pious people. The Gemara questions this proof; <b>“pious ones” indicates many</b> rather than a single righteous person. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Although the text is vocalized in the plural, it <b>is written</b> in the singular: “<b>His pious one”;</b> God maintains the world even for a single pious individual. |
| Proverbs 10:26 | “as vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes” | Kiddushin 45b:11 | The Gemara cites another case: If a minor <b>became betrothed without the consent of her father, and married without</b> his <b>consent, and her father is here, Rav Huna said: She may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: She may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Ulla said: This</b> opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> that in this case she may partake of <i>teruma</i>, is irritating <b>“as vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes”</b> (Proverbs 10:26), as it contradicts his earlier ruling. <b>Now</b> consider: <b>And what</b> about <b>there,</b> i.e., in a case where her betrothal was with her father’s consent, <b>when</b> there is at least <b>betrothal by Torah law, you said she may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> in case he did not consent to the marriage. Is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that <b>here,</b> i.e., where even the betrothal was performed without her father’s consent, she should not be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>? |
| Proverbs 10:26 | vinegar is beneficial for teeth? Isn’t it written: “Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, | Shabbat 111a:4 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Aḥa Arikha,</b> so named for his height as the word <i>arikha</i> literally means long in Aramaic, <b>who is</b> also known as <b>Rav Aha bar Pappa, raised a contradiction before Rabbi Abbahu: We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>one who is concerned</b> about pain <b>in his teeth may not sip vinegar through</b> them on Shabbat. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>vinegar is beneficial for teeth? Isn’t it written: “Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes,</b> so is the lazy one to those who send him” (Proverbs 10:26)? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is a distinction. <b>This</b> verse, which indicates that vinegar is harmful for teeth, is referring <b>to fruit vinegar. The</b> mishna, which indicates that vinegar is beneficial for teeth, is referring <b>to</b> wine <b>vinegar. And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this and that</b> are referring <b>to</b> wine <b>vinegar.</b> In that case, the distinction is as follows: <b>The</b> mishna, which states that vinegar is beneficial for teeth, is referring to a situation in which <b>there is a wound</b> in the teeth. <b>That</b> verse, which indicates that it is harmful for teeth, is referring to a situation in which <b>there is not a wound</b> in the teeth. The Gemara explains: Where <b>there is a wound,</b> vinegar <b>heals</b>; where <b>there is not a wound,</b> it <b>weakens</b> the teeth. |
| Proverbs 10:26 | “as vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes” | Taanit 4b:5 | The Gemara raises a difficulty against this answer. <b>Ulla said: That which Rav Ḥisda</b> said is as <b>difficult</b> to accept <b>“as vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes”</b> (Proverbs 10:26). He elaborates: <b>If when one does not</b> yet <b>request</b> rain, at the beginning of the rainy season, one nevertheless <b>mentions</b> rain; <b>in a case when one requests rain,</b> i.e., during Passover, according to this explanation, <b>is it not right that one should</b> also <b>mention</b> rain? |
| Proverbs 10:27 | which is written: “The fear of the Lord prolongs days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened” | Yoma 9a:4 | § Apropos the Second Temple period, when High Priests were frequently replaced, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The fear of the Lord prolongs days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened”</b> (Proverbs 10:27)? <b>The fear of the Lord prolongs days; that</b> is a reference to the <b>First Temple, which stood</b> for <b>four hundred and ten years and in</b> which <b>only eighteen High Priests served,</b> as is written in the lists of the genealogy of the priests in the Bible. |
| Proverbs 11:3 | “The integrity of the upright shall guide them” | Bava Metzia35a:7 | The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> so that the <b>debtor trusts the creditor</b> that the collateral is not in his possession, <b>and what is different</b> that the <b>creditor does not trust the debtor</b> to accurately assess the value of the collateral? The Gemara answers: The <b>debtor</b> sees <b>in the creditor fulfillment</b> of the verse: <b>“The integrity of the upright shall guide them”</b> (Proverbs 11:3). He believes that God blesses the creditor with wealth to lend because he is an upright person. The <b>creditor</b> sees <b>in the debtor fulfillment</b> of the end of that verse: <b>“But the perverseness of the faithless shall destroy them”</b> (Proverbs 11:3). The creditor believes that God made the debtor poor because he is a deceitful person. |
| Proverbs 11:3 | it is written: “The integrity of the upright will guide them” | Shabbat 88b:1 | <b>who proceed wholeheartedly</b> and with integrity, <b>it is written: “The integrity of the upright will guide them”</b> (Proverbs 11:3), whereas <b>about those people who walk in deceit, it is written</b> at the end of the same verse: <b>“And the perverseness of the faithless will destroy them.”</b> |
| Proverbs 11:4 | it is written: “Riches profit not on the day of wrath, but charity delivers from death” | Bava Batra10a:16 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a contradiction</b> between two texts. In one place <b>it is written: “Riches profit not on the day of wrath, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 11:4), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2). <b>Why</b> is it necessary to have <b>these two</b> verses about <b>charity,</b> that it delivers from death? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba continues: <b>One</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from an unnatural death</b> in this world, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> in the World-to-Come. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> of the verses <b>is that</b> charity <b>which delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> mentioned? It is in <b>that</b> verse <b>in which “wrath” is written, as</b> with regard to the day of judgment <b>it is written: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). <b>And which</b> type of charity <b>is that which delivers from an unnatural death?</b> |
| Proverbs 11:8 | “The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead” | Sanhedrin 39a:1 | And they are the parables concerning the following verses: <b>“The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge”</b> (Ezekiel 18:2); <b>“Just balances, just weights</b>…shall you have” (Leviticus 19:36); and <b>“The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead”</b> (Proverbs 11:8). |
| Proverbs 11:10 | is eliminated from the world, good comes into the world, as it is stated: “And when the wicked perish there is jubilation” | Sanhedrin 113b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach”</b> (Proverbs 18:3). When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>is eliminated from the world, good comes into the world, as it is stated: “And when the wicked perish there is jubilation”</b> (Proverbs 11:10). When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>passes from the world, evil comes into the world, as it is stated: “The righteous perishes and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken, none understand that due to the evil the righteous is taken”</b> (Isaiah 57:1) When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>comes into the world, good comes into the world</b> with him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“This is one who shall comfort us for our work and the toil of our hands”</b> (Genesis 5:29). |
| Proverbs 11:10 | is it not already stated: “When the wicked perish, there is song” | Sanhedrin 37b:1 | <b>Why would we</b> want <b>this trouble?</b> Perhaps it would be better not to testify at all. <b>But</b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: “And he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it,</b> then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1)? It is a transgression not to testify when one can do so. <b>And perhaps you will say: Why would we</b> want <b>to be responsible for the blood of this</b> person? <b>But</b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: “When the wicked perish, there is song”</b> (Proverbs 11:10)? |
| Proverbs 11:10 | each and every | Sanhedrin 39b:3 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Therefore,</b> since all humanity descends from one person, <b>each and every</b> person is obligated to say: The world was created for me. The mishna then teaches that the court says to the witnesses: And perhaps you will say: Why would we want to be responsible for the blood of this person? But be aware, as is it not already stated: “When the wicked perish, there is song” (Proverbs 11:10)? The Gemara teaches: A separate verse relates that after the evil king Ahab was killed: <b>“And the song went throughout the camp”</b> (I Kings 22:36). <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says:</b> The fact that the verse states “the song,” and not a song, indicates that it is referring to a song mentioned elsewhere. Accordingly, the verse: <b>“When the wicked perish, there is song,”</b> alludes to this episode: <b>When Ahab ben Omri perished,</b> there was <b>song.</b> |
| Proverbs 11:13 | is stated: “He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; | Bava Kamma99b:20 | <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>when</b> a judge <b>leaves</b> the courthouse, <b>he should not say</b> to the litigant: <b>I found you innocent and my colleagues found you liable, but what can I do, since my colleagues outnumber me? And</b> it is <b>concerning</b> a circumstance such as <b>this</b> that it <b>is stated: “He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets;</b> but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13). |
| Proverbs 11:13 | and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets, | Sanhedrin 29a:18 | <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves</b> the courtroom <b>he may not say: I deemed</b> you <b>exempt and my colleagues deemed</b> you <b>liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me</b> and consequently you were deemed liable? <b>About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16), <b>and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,</b> but one who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13). |
| Proverbs 11:13 | and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets” | Sanhedrin 31a:10 | § The mishna teaches: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves</b> the courtroom, he should not say: I deemed you exempt and my colleagues deemed you liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me and consequently you were deemed liable? About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people” (Leviticus 19:16), and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets, but one who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves he should not say: I deemed</b> you <b>exempt and my colleagues deemed</b> you <b>liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me</b> and consequently you were deemed liable? <b>The verse states: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16), <b>and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets”</b> (Proverbs 11:13). |
| Proverbs 11:14 | in much counsel” | Yevamot 121a:14 | In light of this response, <b>Shmuel recited</b> this verse <b>about Rav: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21). Since the righteous Rav waited and did not excommunicate Rav Sheila, he was prevented from causing him injustice. Rav Sheila had been mistaken and had not intentionally violated the decree of the Sages prohibiting a woman from remarrying on the basis of her husband having disappeared into an endless body of water. <b>Rav recited</b> this verse <b>about Shmuel: “But salvation</b> lies <b>in much counsel”</b> (Proverbs 11:14), since it was Shmuel’s advice that caused Rav to wait. |
| Proverbs 11:15 | which is written: “He who serves as a guarantor for a stranger shall suffer evil; | Yevamot 109b:3 | <b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who serves as a guarantor for a stranger shall suffer evil;</b> but he who hates those who shake hands is secure” (Proverbs 11:15)? This means: <b>Evil after evil will befall those who accept converts, and Sheltziyyon guarantors, and one who confounds himself in matters of <i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara clarifies. Evil will befall <b>those who accept converts: This is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo. As Rabbi Ḥelbo says: Converts are difficult for the Jewish people like a leprous sore on the skin.</b> |
| Proverbs 11:17 | called pious, as it is stated: “The pious man does good [ gomel ] to his own soul; but he who troubles his own flesh | Taanit 11b:2 | <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One who fasts is <b>called pious, as it is stated: “The pious man does good [<i>gomel</i>] to his own soul; but he who troubles his own flesh</b> is cruel” (Proverbs 11:17). The verb <i>gomel</i> can also mean weaning, or abstaining from unnecessary pleasure. Accordingly, Reish Lakish derives from this verse that one who abstains from food is called pious. Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet said: This student of a Torah academy who sits in</b> observance of <b>a fast</b> has <b>let a dog eat his portion.</b> Since his fast weakens him and prevents him from studying Torah, it is considered as though a dog ate his meal, as the student derived no benefit from it. |
| Proverbs 11:21 | The Sages taught: One who counts money for a woman from his hand to her hand in order to look upon her, even if he has accumulated Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished” | Berakhot 61a:21 | <b>The Sages taught: One who counts money for a woman from his hand to her hand in order to look upon her, even if he has accumulated Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 11:21); one who hands money from his hand to her hand, even if he received the Torah from God’s hand to his own, like Moses, <b>he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna,</b> which is called evil. |
| Proverbs 11:21 | he is like Moses our teacher, who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna. The verse says about him: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not go unpunished” | Eruvin 18b:4 | <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who counts out money for a woman from his hand into her hand or from her hand into his hand, in order to look upon her, even if</b> in other matters <b>he is like Moses our teacher, who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna.

One who hands money from his hand to her hand, even if he received the Torah from God’s hand to his own, like Moses, <b>he will not be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna,</b> which is called evil. |
| Proverbs 11:24 | And if you see a generation for whom Torah is beloved, disseminate, as it is stated: “There is who scatters, and yet increases” | Berakhot 63a:10 | With regard to this verse, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Hillel the Elder says: At the time of gathering,</b> if the Sages of the generation see to it that the Torah remains the purview of the few, <b>disseminate</b> it to the public at large. <b>At the time of dissemination, gather,</b> and leave it to others to disseminate the Torah. <b>And if you see a generation for whom Torah is beloved, disseminate, as it is stated: “There is who scatters, and yet increases”</b> (Proverbs 11:24). However, <b>if you see a generation for whom Torah is not beloved, gather;</b> do not cause the Torah to be disgraced, <b>as it is stated: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah.”</b> Preventing Torah study in that situation is a manifestation of work for the Lord. |
| Proverbs 11:25 | Rav Sheshet says: Anyone who teaches Torah in this world is privileged and teaches it in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And he who satisfies abundantly [ umarveh ] shall be satisfied himself [ yoreh ]” | Sanhedrin 92a:4 | <b>Rav Sheshet says: Anyone who teaches Torah in this world is privileged and teaches it in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And he who satisfies abundantly [<i>umarveh</i>] shall be satisfied himself [<i>yoreh</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 11:25). Rav Sheshet interprets the verse homiletically: By transposing the letters of the word <i>marveh</i>: <i>Mem</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>, one arrives at the word <i>moreh</i>, meaning teaches. The verse means that one who teaches [<i>moreh</i>] will teach [<i>yoreh</i>] in the future as well. |
| Proverbs 11:26 | the people [ leom ] shall curse him [ yikkevuhu ], | Sanhedrin 92a:1 | <b>the people [<i>leom</i>] shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>],</b> but blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides” (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And</b> the term <b><i>leom</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than fetuses, as it is stated:</b> “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your bowels; <b>and the one <i>leom</i> shall overcome the other <i>leom</i>”</b> (Genesis 25:23). <b>And <i>kabbo</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than curse, as it is stated</b> in the statement of Balaam: <b>“How can I curse one who is not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>] by God?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>bar</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Pay homage to <i>bar</i> lest He be angry”</b> (Psalms 2:12), i.e., observe the Torah to avoid God’s wrath. |
| Proverbs 11:26 | the people yikkevuhu ” | Sanhedrin 92a:2 | <b>Ulla bar Yishmael says: One perforates like a sieve</b> a person who withholds <i>halakha</i> from a student. <b>It is written here:</b> “He who withholds <i>bar</i>, <b>the people <i>yikkevuhu</i>”</b> (Proverbs 11:26), <b>and it is written there: “And he bored [<i>vayyikkov</i>] a hole in its lid of it”</b> (II Kings 12:10). <b>And Abaye says:</b> One perforates him <b>like a launderers’ utensil</b> used for sprinkling water on garments. |
| Proverbs 11:26 | “But blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides [ mashbir ]” | Sanhedrin 92a:3 | <b>And if one teaches</b> the student <i>halakha</i> rather than withholding it, <b>what is his reward? Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says: He is privileged</b> to receive <b>blessings like Joseph, as it is stated</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“But blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides [<i>mashbir</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And <i>mashbir</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>other than Joseph, as it is stated: “And Joseph was the governor of the land, and he was the provider [<i>hamashbir</i>] to all the people of the land”</b> (Genesis 42:6). |
| Proverbs 11:30 | My ancestors stored up treasures of money, whereas I am storing up treasures of souls, as it is stated: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise” | Bava Batra11a:4 | <b>My ancestors stored up something that does not generate profit,</b> as money sitting in a treasury does not increase, <b>whereas I am storing up something that generates profit, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous, that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>My ancestors stored up treasures of money, whereas I am storing up treasures of souls, as it is stated: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise”</b> (Proverbs 11:30). <b>My ancestors stored up for others,</b> for their sons and heirs, when they themselves would pass from this world, <b>whereas I am storing up for myself, as it is stated: “And it shall be as righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>My ancestors stored up for this world, whereas I am storing up for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard”</b> (Isaiah 58:8). |
| Proverbs 11:30 | about him: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that is wise wins souls” | Bava Metzia85a:11 | Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about him: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that is wise wins souls”</b> (Proverbs 11:30). The Gemara explains, with regard to the phrase <b>“the fruit of the righteous,”</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who was the son of a righteous individual and became a great scholar in his own right. When the verse states: <b>“And he that is wise wins souls,” this</b> is referring to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Isi ben Lakonya,</b> who successfully helped Rabbi Yosei reach his potential. |
| Proverbs 12:10 | She said to them: “A righteous man understands the life of his beast” | Ketubot 63a:1 | <b>will you lead</b> the life of a <b>widow of a living man,</b> living alone while your husband is in another place? <b>She said to him: If he</b> would <b>listen to me, he would sit</b> and study <b>for another twelve years.</b> When Rabbi Akiva heard this <b>he said: I have permission to do</b> this. <b>He went back and sat for another twelve years in the study hall. When he came</b> back <b>he brought twenty-four thousand students with him. His wife heard and went out</b> toward him <b>to greet him. Her neighbors said: Borrow some clothes and wear them,</b> as your current apparel is not appropriate to meet an important person. <b>She said to them: “A righteous man understands the life of his beast”</b> (Proverbs 12:10). <b>When she came to him she fell on her face and kissed his feet.

| Proverbs 12:10 | She said to him: “A righteous man regards the life of his beast” | Nedarim 50a:5 | Eventually <b>he came</b> back accompanied <b>by 24,000 pairs of students. Everyone went out to</b> greet <b>him,</b> as he was by then a renowned teacher, <b>and she too arose to go out to</b> greet <b>him. That wicked person said to her: And to where are you</b> going? As she was excessively poor, she was not dressed in a grand manner, as fit for the wife of one so esteemed. <b>She said to him: “A righteous man regards the life of his beast”</b> (Proverbs 12:10); he knows that I am in this state as a result of my dedication to him. <b>She came to present herself before</b> Rabbi Akiva, but <b>the Sages</b> tried to <b>fend her off,</b> as they were unaware of her identity. <b>He said to them: Leave her.</b> Both <b>my</b> Torah knowledge <b>and yours are hers.</b> When <b>bar Kalba Savua heard</b> that the famous man was his son-in-law, <b>he came</b> before halakhic authorities <b>and requested the dissolution of his vow, and it was dissolved.</b> |
| Proverbs 12:11 | which is written: “One who works [ oved ] his land shall have plenty of bread” | Sanhedrin 58b:24 | <b>And</b> in connection with that statement, the Gemara notes that <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “One who works [<i>oved</i>] his land shall have plenty of bread”</b> (Proverbs 12:11)? <b>If a person makes himself like a slave [<i>ke’eved</i>] to the land,</b> devoting his efforts to it, <b>he will have plenty of bread, but if not, he will not have plenty of bread.</b> |
| Proverbs 12:18 | “There is one who utters like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of the wise is health” | Eruvin 64b:18 | <b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With <b>what did Rabban Gamliel open</b> the possibility for dissolving his vow <b>for that man,</b> i.e., what opening did he find for him? Rabban Gamliel cited the verse: <b>“There is one who utters like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of the wise is health”</b> (Proverbs 12:18) and explained it as follows: <b>Whoever utters</b> a vow <b>deserves to be pierced by a sword,</b> as he might fail to fulfill it. Therefore, one should not vow at all. Had you known that whoever vows is liable to be executed, would you have vowed? <b>Rather, it is the tongue of the wise that heals,</b> as when a Sage dissolves a vow, he dissolves it retroactively, and it is as though one had never taken the vow. |
| Proverbs 12:18 | “There is one who speaks like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health” | Nedarim 22a:4 | <b>And we</b> also <b>do not broach</b> dissolution <b>in this other</b> way, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> type of dissolution <b>did Rabban Gamliel broach for a certain elderly man</b> who had taken a vow and came before him for dissolution? He informed him that it is written: <b>“There is one who speaks like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health”</b> (Proverbs 12:18), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Anyone who verbally expresses</b> the language of a vow, it is <b>appropriate to pierce him with a sword, but</b> he has another option: <b>“The tongue of the wise is health,”</b> since the Sages can release him from his vow. Quoting this verse with its interpretation is also not an acceptable method of broaching dissolution. |
| Proverbs 12:21 | about himself: “No sin shall befall the righteous” | Avodah Zarah39a:11 | Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>said</b> to himself: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that he called it <i>batei</i>,</b> I can <b>conclude from</b> here that <b>there is a non-kosher substance in</b> the <i>tzaḥanta</i>. And <b>he did not eat from it</b> that night. <b>In the morning, he examined</b> the dish and in fact <b>found a non-kosher substance in it. He read</b> the following verse <b>about himself: “No sin shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21). |
| Proverbs 12:21 | and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous” | Berakhot 7b:21 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that this,</b> which says not to confront <b>and that,</b> which says to confront, are both referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling,</b> but the question of whether one is permitted to confront him depends on who is confronting him. <b>And</b> nevertheless, this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to a completely righteous person, while this,</b> which says that one may not confront the wicked, is referring <b>to one who is not completely righteous, as Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he?”</b> (Habakkuk 1:13). This verse is difficult to understand. <b>Do the wicked swallow the righteous? Isn’t it written:</b> “The wicked looks to the righteous and seeks to kill him; <b>the Lord will not leave him in his hand,</b> nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged” (Psalms 37:32–33), <b>and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21)? <b>Rather,</b> in light of these verses, the verse: “The wicked swallows the man more righteous than he” means: <b>The</b> man who is <b>more righteous than he,</b> but not completely righteous, <b>he swallows. The completely righteous he does not swallow.</b> |
| Proverbs 12:21 | “There shall no mischief befall the righteous” | Chullin 59a:5 | Rav <b>said to him: What is the rectification</b> for such an uncertainty? Shmuel said to him: <b>We shall set it in a</b> hot <b>oven, as it will</b> then <b>inspect itself.</b> Shmuel <b>set it</b> in the oven on a spit, and the meat <b>fell</b> off the bone <b>bit by bit,</b> a sign that a snake had bitten the young deer. <b>Shmuel recited about Rav</b> the verse: <b>“There shall no mischief befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21), since he was saved due to his righteousness. <b>Rav recited about Shmuel</b> the verse: “And <b>no secret causes you trouble”</b> (Daniel 4:6), since he was learned even with regard to such matters. |
| Proverbs 12:21 | about Rav: “No mishap shall befall the righteous” | Niddah 65a:9 | <b>Before</b> Minyamin reached Shmuel’s place, <b>he passed away on the road,</b> and he never completed the journey. Upon hearing this, <b>Shmuel recited</b> this verse <b>about Rav: “No mishap shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21), i.e., God does not allow prohibited acts to come from the statements of the righteous. In this case, Minyamin ruled incorrectly, based on a misunderstanding of Rav’s statement. |
| Proverbs 12:21 | about Rav: “No mischief shall befall the righteous” | Yevamot 121a:14 | In light of this response, <b>Shmuel recited</b> this verse <b>about Rav: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21). Since the righteous Rav waited and did not excommunicate Rav Sheila, he was prevented from causing him injustice. Rav Sheila had been mistaken and had not intentionally violated the decree of the Sages prohibiting a woman from remarrying on the basis of her husband having disappeared into an endless body of water. <b>Rav recited</b> this verse <b>about Shmuel: “But salvation</b> lies <b>in much counsel”</b> (Proverbs 11:14), since it was Shmuel’s advice that caused Rav to wait. |
| Proverbs 12:25 | “Anxiety in a man’s heart dejects him [ yashḥena ]” | Sanhedrin 100b:6 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps the book poses a difficulty <b>because it is written</b> there: <b>Do not introduce anxiety into your heart, as anxiety has killed mighty men</b> (Ben Sira 14:1; 30:29). <b>Didn’t Solomon</b> already <b>say it</b> in the verse: <b>“Anxiety in a man’s heart dejects him [<i>yashḥena</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 12:25)? <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> interpret the term homiletically and read it as <i>yesiḥenna</i>. <b>One says</b> that it means: <b>He shall remove it [<i>yesiḥenna</i>] from his mind,</b> and that will ease his anxiety. <b>And one says: He shall tell it [<i>yesiḥenna</i>] to others,</b> and that will ease his anxiety. Both agree with the statement of ben Sira. |
| Proverbs 12:25 | “If there is a care in the heart of a man, let him bend it [ yashḥena ]” | Sotah 42b:14 | In a similar vein, one is urged to relieve his distress. The verse states: <b>“If there is a care in the heart of a man, let him bend it [<i>yashḥena</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 12:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: He should force it [<i>yasḥena</i>] out of his mind.</b> He should remove his worries from his thoughts. <b>And one said:</b> It means <b>he should tell [<i>yesiḥena</i>]</b> his troubles <b>to others,</b> which will relieve his anxiety. |
| Proverbs 12:25 | “If there is care in a man’s heart, let him quash it [ yashḥena ]” | Yoma 75a:2 | § The Gemara explains another verse in Proverbs: <b>“If there is care in a man’s heart, let him quash it [<i>yashḥena</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 12:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: He should forcefully push it [<i>yasḥena</i>] out of his mind.</b> One who worries should banish his concerns from his thoughts. <b>And one said:</b> It means <b>he should tell [<i>yesiḥena</i>] others his</b> concerns, which will lower his anxiety. |
| Proverbs 12:27 | which is written: “The slothful man [ remiyya ] will not roast [ yaḥarokh ] his prey” | Avodah Zarah19a:16 | <b>Rav Sheizvi said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The slothful man [<i>remiyya</i>] will not roast [<i>yaḥarokh</i>] his prey”</b> (Proverbs 12:27)? <b>The deceitful [<i>harammai</i>] hunter,</b> i.e., one who tricks people into believing that he has acquired vast stores of knowledge by studying new material without reviewing that which he has already learned, <b>will not live [<i>yiḥye</i>] a long [<i>ya’arikh</i>] life.</b> According to this interpretation, <i>yaḥarokh</i> is a combination of the words <i>yiḥye</i> and <i>ya’arikh</i>. |
| Proverbs 12:27 | that which is written: “The slothful man [ remiyya ] will not roast [ yaḥarokh ] his catch” | Eruvin 54b:6 | The Gemara continues with this topic: <b>Rav Sheizvi said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The slothful man [<i>remiyya</i>] will not roast [<i>yaḥarokh</i>] his catch”</b> (Proverbs 12:27)? <b>The deceitful [<i>rammai</i>] hunter will not live [<i>yiḥyeh</i>] a long life [<i>ya’arikh</i>].</b> A deceitful hunter continues to hunt more and more animals without holding on to the animals he has already caught. Similarly, someone who continues to study new material without reviewing what he has already learned will not be successful. |
| Proverbs 13:7 | is stated: “There is one who seems to be rich, yet has nothing; there is one who seems to be poor, yet has great wealth” | Menachot 85b:18 | <b>When</b> the messenger finally <b>reached his city, the people of his city came out to praise him [<i>lekaleso</i>]</b> for achieving this tremendous feat. The messenger <b>said to them: Do not praise me.

| Proverbs 13:9 | When the light saw that it had been concealed for the righteous, it rejoiced, as it is stated: “The light for the righteous shall rejoice” | Chagigah 12a:11 | <b>When the light saw that it had been concealed for the righteous, it rejoiced, as it is stated: “The light for the righteous shall rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 13:9). |
| Proverbs 13:11 | which is written: “Wealth gotten through vanity [ mehevel ] shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase” | Avodah Zarah19a:14 | The Gemara cites other statements relating to Torah study. <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Wealth gotten through vanity [<i>mehevel</i>] shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase”</b> (Proverbs 13:11)? <b>If a person turns his Torah into many bundles [<i>ḥavilot</i>],</b> by studying large amounts in a short period of time without reviewing, his Torah <b>will diminish. But if he gathers</b> his knowledge <b>little by little,</b> by studying slowly and reviewing, his knowledge <b>shall increase.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:11 | shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase” | Eruvin 54b:9 | Similarly, <b>Rabba said that Rav Seḥora said that Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Wealth gotten through vanity</b> [<b><i>hevel</i></b>] <b>shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase”</b> (Proverbs 13:11)? <b>If a person turns his Torah into bundles</b> [<b><i>ḥavilot</i>,</b> derived from the word <i>hevel</i> by replacing the <i>heh</i> with a <i>ḥet</i>], studying large amounts at the same time, his Torah <b>will diminish. And if not,</b> i.e., if he learns little by little and reviews what he has learned, <b>he that gathers little by little shall increase.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:12 | As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick” | Berakhot 32b:9 | The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:12 | will ultimately come to heartache, as it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick” | Berakhot 55a:1 | <b>Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it</b> to be answered, <b>will ultimately come to heartache, as it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins, and they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting or standing next to an <b>inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse, <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of his status and merit, <b>and passing a case against another to Heaven,</b> as praying for Heaven to pass judgment on another person causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of that other person. This proves that prolonging prayer is a fault. |
| Proverbs 13:16 | that which is written: “In everything a prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool unfolds his folly” | Megillah 12b:14 | The verse describes Ahasuerus’s search for a new wife by stating: <b>“And let the king appoint officers</b> in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle” (Esther 2:3). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “In everything a prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool unfolds his folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16)? The verse highlights the difference between two kings’ approaches to finding a wife. |
| Proverbs 13:16 | “But a fool unfolds his folly” | Megillah 12b:15 | <b>“In everything a prudent man acts with knowledge”; this</b> statement is referring to <b>David,</b> who also sought a wife for himself, <b>as it is written: “And his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin”</b> (I Kings 1:2). Since he sought one maiden, <b>whoever had a daughter brought her to him,</b> for everyone wanted his daughter to be the king’s wife. With regard to the continuation of the verse: <b>“But a fool unfolds his folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16), <b>this</b> statement <b>is</b> referring to <b>Ahasuerus, as it is written: “And let the king appoint officers”</b> to seek out many maidens. Since it became clear that the king would have relations with all of them, but in the end he would choose only one as his bride, <b>whoever had a daughter hid her from him.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:16 | and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly” | Nedarim 22b:2 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Anyone who gets angry,</b> at that moment <b>even the Divine Presence is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God”</b> (Psalms 10:4). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> Anyone who gets angry <b>forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:9), <b>and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to one who gets angry, <b>it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in transgression”</b> (Proverbs 29:22). |
| Proverbs 13:22 | and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous” | Bava Kamma119a:8 | The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda had a certain sharecropper who would weigh</b> the field’s produce <b>and give</b> Rav Ḥisda his portion, and <b>weigh</b> the produce <b>and take</b> his own portion. Rav Ḥisda <b>dismissed him,</b> and <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him:</b> “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children; <b>and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 13:22). |
| Proverbs 13:23 | When Rav Yosef reached this verse, he cried: “But there are those swept away without justice” | Chagigah 4b:11 | <b>When Rav Yosef reached this verse, he cried: “But there are those swept away without justice”</b> (Proverbs 13:23). <b>He said: Is there one who goes before his time</b> and dies for no reason? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, like this</b> incident of <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye, who would be frequented</b> by the company of <b>the Angel of Death</b> and would see how people died at the hands of this angel. The Angel of Death <b>said to his agent: Go</b> and <b>bring me,</b> i.e., kill, <b>Miriam</b> the <b>raiser,</b> i.e., braider, of <b>women’s hair. He went,</b> but instead <b>brought him Miriam,</b> the <b>raiser of babies.</b> |
| Proverbs 13:23 | not written: “But there are those swept away without justice” | Chagigah 5a:2 | <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said to</b> the Angel of Death: Do <b>you have the right to act in this</b> manner, to take someone before his time? The Angel of Death <b>said to him: And</b> is it <b>not written: “But there are those swept away without justice”</b> (Proverbs 13:23)? Rav Beivai <b>said to him: And isn’t it written: “One generation passes away, and another generation comes”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:4), which indicates that there is a predetermined amount of time for the life of every generation. |
| Proverbs 14:1 | which is written: “The wisdom of women builds her house” | Sanhedrin 110a:3 | She said to him: <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to that <b>which he said to you, to prepare sky-blue dye</b> for your ritual fringes, one could respond to him: <b>If it enters your mind,</b> Moses, that using <b>sky-blue dye is considered a mitzva, take out robes</b> that are made entirely <b>of</b> material colored with <b>sky-blue dye, and dress all</b> the students <b>of your academy</b> in sky-blue robes without ritual fringes; why could one not fulfill the mitzva in that manner? Clearly, Moses is fabricating all this. <b>This is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The wisdom of women builds her house”</b> (Proverbs 14:1); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the wife of On, son of Peleth.</b> And: <b>“Folly plucks it down with her hands”</b> (Proverbs 14:1); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the wife of Korah.</b> |
| Proverbs 14:4 | “And much produce comes by the strength of the ox” | Sanhedrin 42a:6 | The Gemara presents another statement, citing Rabbi Aḥa, citing Rabbi Asi, citing Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: <b>“For by wise advice you shall make your war”</b> (Proverbs 24:6). <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In whom do you find the war,</b> i.e., the ability to engage in disputes, <b>of Torah? In one who has in his possession bundles,</b> i.e., vast knowledge, <b>of Mishna.</b> One must first learn the primary sources before engaging in disputes of Torah. <b>Rav Yosef would read concerning himself</b> the verse: <b>“And much produce comes by the strength of the ox”</b> (Proverbs 14:4), i.e., one with great strength can bring a large yield. Rav Yosef was known to be particularly well-versed in tannaitic statements. |
| Proverbs 14:10 | there were no experts there at all; we feed him based on his opinion, as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” | Yoma 83a:10 | <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> an ill person himself says he needs to eat and <b>there are no experts present, one feeds him according to his own opinion.</b> This implies that <b>the reason</b> one feeds him <b>is</b> because <b>there are no experts</b> present. One may infer from this that if <b>there were experts</b> present, <b>no,</b> one would not feed the ill person based on his own opinion but would instead listen to the advice of the experts. The Gemara rejects this: <b>This is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one follows the opinion of the experts <b>said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the ill person <b>said: I do not need</b> to eat. <b>However,</b> if <b>he said: I do need</b> to eat, it is considered as if <b>there were no experts there at all; we feed him based on his opinion, as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul”</b> (Proverbs 14:10). All the experts are ignored in the face of the ill person’s own sensitivities. |
| Proverbs 14:10 | “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” | Yoma 83a:2 | § It was taught in the mishna: If a person is <b>ill</b> and requires food due to potential danger, <b>one feeds him according to</b> the advice of medical <b>experts. Rabbi Yannai said:</b> If <b>an ill person says</b> he <b>needs</b> to eat, <b>and a doctor says he does not need</b> to eat, <b>one listens to the ill person. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is because the verse states: <b>“The heart knows the bitterness of its soul”</b> (Proverbs 14:10), meaning an ill person knows the intensity of his pain and weakness, and doctors cannot say otherwise. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that a person knows himself better than anyone else does. Why does this need to be stated explicitly? The Gemara answers: It is <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the doctor is more certain</b> because he has had more experience with this condition. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that even so, it is the ill person who knows his own suffering better than anyone else. |
| Proverbs 14:10 | as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” | Yoma 83a:9 | <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Any</b> instance <b>where</b> an ill person <b>says: I need</b> to eat, <b>even if there are one hundred</b> expert doctors <b>who say</b> that <b>he does not need</b> to eat, <b>we listen to his own</b> opinion and feed him, <b>as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul”</b> (Proverbs 14:10). |
| Proverbs 14:12 | as it is stated: “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end are the ways of death” | Kiddushin 40b:7 | <b>And to what are the wicked in this world compared? To a tree that stands entirely in an impure place and whose branches hang over a pure place.</b> If <b>its branches are cut off, it stands entirely in an impure place. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, bestows good upon the wicked in this world</b> for the few mitzvot they have performed, <b>in order to expel them and banish them to the lowest level</b> of Gehenna in the future, <b>as it is stated: “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end are the ways of death”</b> (Proverbs 14:12). |
| Proverbs 14:15 | as it is written: “The thoughtless one [ peti ] believes every word” | Keritot 9a:21 | The Gemara objects: <b>Let the verse write</b> simply: <b>“Suddenly [<i>pitom</i>],” as</b> this term <b>indicates unwitting</b> transgression, <b>and</b> it also <b>indicates intentional</b> transgression, <b>and</b> it also <b>indicates</b> transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control.</b> The Gemara elaborates: “Suddenly” indicates <b>intentional</b> transgression <b>and</b> transgression due to <b>circumstances beyond his control, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said</b> in the <i>baraitot</i> earlier; <b>and it also indicates unwitting</b> transgression, <b>as it is written: “The thoughtless one [<i>peti</i>] believes every word”</b> (Proverbs 14:15), and because he is misinformed, his transgression is unwitting. <b>And</b> if so, <b>let the verse not write: Unexpected [<i>peta</i>].</b> |
| Proverbs 14:23 | Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira. He saw that Rabbi Yirmeya was excessively joyful. He said to him: It is written: “In all sorrow there is profit” | Berakhot 30b:23 | Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira. He saw that Rabbi Yirmeya was excessively joyful. He said to him: It is written: “In all sorrow there is profit”</b> (Proverbs 14:23); sorrow is appropriate, not excessive joy. |
| Proverbs 14:24 | when Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya died, the crowns of wisdom ceased, as “the crown of the wise is their riches” | Sotah 49b:17 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya died, the crowns of wisdom ceased, as “the crown of the wise is their riches”</b> (Proverbs 14:24), and he was both a great Torah scholar and a very wealthy man. <b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa died, the men of</b> wondrous <b>deeds ceased. From</b> the time <b>when Abba Yosei ben Katonta died, the pious men ceased. And why was he called Abba Yosei ben Katonta? Because he was among the diminished [<i>miktanei</i>] of the pious people,</b> i.e., he lived in an era when the pious had become few. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people” | Berakhot 53a:23 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>People were seated in the study hall and they brought fire before them</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say: Each and every individual recites a blessing for himself; and Beit Hillel say: One recites a blessing on behalf of everyone</b> and the others answer amen. Beit Hillel’s reasoning is <b>as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). When everyone joins together to hear the blessing, the name of God is glorified. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “In the multitude of people is the king’s glory” | Megillah 27b:4 | <b>And the Rabbis,</b> how could they respond to Rabbi Meir’s claim? <b>If there is</b> cause <b>to be concerned</b> about the decrease in the number of people who will use the object when it is transferred from a community to an individual, then <b>in a case like this as well,</b> where the object is transferred to a smaller community, <b>there</b> should be cause <b>to be concerned</b> about this <b>due to</b> the principle expressed in the verse: <b>“In the multitude of people is the king’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). The verse teaches that the larger the assembly involved in a mitzva, the greater the honor to God. However, it is apparent that this principle does not prevent the sale of a synagogue to a smaller community, and therefore it should not prevent the selling of a synagogue to an individual. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | because it is written: “In the multitude of people is the King’s glory” | Menachot 62a:6 | The Gemara adds: <b>And this teaches us that we require three priests</b> to perform this service: One to bring the parts from the slaughtering area, one to wave them, and a third to burn them upon the altar. The reason why all three acts cannot be performed by a single priest is <b>because it is written: “In the multitude of people is the King’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). If a larger number of priests are involved in the Temple service, this represents greater glory for God. Therefore, it is preferable for the service to be carried out by three priests rather than one. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “in the multitude of people is the king’s glory” | Pesachim 64b:15 | It was also taught in the mishna that the priest would <b>pass</b> the bowl of blood <b>to another</b> priest. The Gemara suggests: <b>Learn from this that carrying without walking,</b> i.e., transporting the blood to the altar by passing it from hand to hand without actually walking with it to the altar, <b>is</b> considered a valid act of <b>carrying</b> the blood of a sacrifice to the altar, one of the four rites involved in the offering of a sacrifice. This would resolve the same unanswered question in tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the priest <b>would move a little</b> with his feet as he passed the bowl to the next priest, in order to fulfill the requirement to walk with the blood to the altar. <b>Rather, what does this</b> account of how they transported the blood to the altar <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us</b> that the priests were arranged in rows in order to increase the number of people involved in the rite and fulfill the principle that <b>“in the multitude of people is the king’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). |
| Proverbs 14:28 | that: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people” | Rosh Hashanah32b:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the <b>second</b> prayer leader, that he <b>sounds</b> the <i>shofar</i> during the additional prayer? Is it <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28)? In other words, is the <i>shofar</i> sounded during the additional prayer because all of the congregants will have arrived by then? <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b><i>hallel</i> too, let us say</b> that it should be read <b>by the second</b> prayer leader, <b>due to</b> the principle <b>that “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people.”</b> |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “In the multitude of people is the King’s glory” | Sukkah 52b:15 | One of the Sages <b>taught: And these</b> young priests who held the pitchers <b>were superior</b> in strength <b>to the son of Marta, daughter of Baitos,</b> who was a priest renowned for his might. <b>They said about the son of Marta, daughter of Baitos, that he would take two thighs of a large bull</b> that was so large <b>that</b> it would be <b>purchased for one thousand <i>zuz</i>, and walk</b> up the ramp in small steps, <b>heel to toe,</b> without hurrying, due to his strength. However, <b>his brethren the priests would not allow him do so, due to</b> the principle: <b>“In the multitude of people is the King’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). The more priests engaged in the Temple service, the greater glory for God. Therefore, it is preferable for the thighs to be carried to the altar by multiple priests. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “In the multitude of people is the king’s glory” | Yoma 26a:13 | The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? One Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna discussed here, <b>holds</b> that it is proper to follow the verse: <b>“In the multitude of people is the king’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). It is a glorification of God for many priests to participate in the service, so different priests were assigned the task of taking the limbs to the ramp, and others were tasked with carrying them up the ramp to the altar. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <b>holds</b> that it is <b>not proper conduct</b> in <b>the place of the Divine Presence</b> to have two sets of priests for these tasks, as it gives the appearance that the first set does not want to be bothered to take the limbs up to the altar. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “The king’s glory is in the multitude of people” | Yoma 70a:10 | The Gemara clarifies why this principle might have applied here. <b>And what mitzva</b> is there in hearing the reading of the High Priest? It is a fulfillment of the principle expressed in the verse: <b>“The king’s glory is in the multitude of people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). Having a large assembly involved in a mitzva gives honor to God. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the problem with seeing both events was only a practical one. |
| Proverbs 14:28 | “In the multitude of people is the king’s glory” | Zevachim 14b:18 | The Gemara answers: <b>There, too,</b> the priests <b>would move a bit</b> with their feet while passing the blood forward. The Gemara asks: <b>But what is</b> the mishna <b>teaching us</b> in this description, if not that the blood need not be conveyed by foot? The Gemara answers: It teaches that: <b>“In the multitude of people is the king’s glory”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). It honors God when the Temple service is performed by a multitude of priests. |
| Proverbs 14:30 | but envy is the rotting of the bones” | Shabbat 152b:10 | Rav Aḥai <b>said to him: Whoever taught you</b> the book of <b>Ecclesiastes did not teach you</b> the book of <b>Proverbs, for it is written</b> in Proverbs: “A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh, <b>but envy is the rotting of the bones”</b> (Proverbs 14:30). This means that <b>anyone who has envy in his heart</b> during his lifetime, <b>his bones rot</b> in the grave, and <b>anyone who does not have envy in his heart, his bones do not rot.</b> |
| Proverbs 14:31 | but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him” | Berakhot 18a:12 | <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who sees the deceased</b> taken to burial <b>and does not escort him has committed a transgression due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord,</b> and the Lord will repay him” (Proverbs 19:17), and: “He who oppresses the poor blasphemes his Creator, <b>but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him”</b> (Proverbs 14:31). |
| Proverbs 14:33 | which is written: “In the heart of him that has discernment wisdom rests; but in the inward part of fools it makes itself known” | Bava Metzia85b:2 | <b>Rav Ḥama says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the heart of him that has discernment wisdom rests; but in the inward part of fools it makes itself known”</b> (Proverbs 14:33)? <b>“In the heart of him who has discernment wisdom rests”; this</b> is <b>a Torah scholar, son of a Torah scholar. “But in the inward part of fools it makes itself known”; this</b> is <b>a Torah scholar, son of an ignoramus,</b> as his wisdom stands out in contrast to the foolishness of the rest of his family. <b>Ulla said: This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say:</b> A small <b>coin in</b> an empty <b>barrel calls: <i>Kish</i>, <i>kish</i>,</b> i.e., it rattles loudly, whereas a coin in a barrel full of coins is not heard. |
| Proverbs 14:34 | that which the verse states: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but the kindness of the peoples is sin” | Bava Batra10b:7 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: My sons, what is</b> the meaning of <b>that which the verse states: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> (Proverbs 14:34)? <b>Rabbi Eliezer answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth?”</b> (I Chronicles 17:21). <b>“But the kindness of the peoples is sin,”</b> meaning that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform are</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only to elevate themselves</b> in prestige, <b>as it is stated: “That they may sacrifice offerings of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons”</b> (Ezra 6:10). Even though they donated offerings, they did so only for their own benefit. |
| Proverbs 15:1 | “A soft answer turns away wrath” | Berakhot 17a:9 | <b>Abaye was wont to say:</b> <b>One must always be shrewd</b> and utilize every strategy <b>in</b> order to achieve <b>fear</b> of Heaven and performance of mitzvot. One must fulfill the verse: <b>“A soft answer turns away wrath”</b> (Proverbs 15:1) and take steps to <b>increase peace with one’s brethren and with one’s relatives,</b> <b>and with all people, even with a non-Jew in the marketplace,</b> despite the fact that he is of no importance to him and does not know him at all (<i>Me’iri</i>), <b>so that he will be loved above</b> in God’s eyes, <b>pleasant below</b> in the eyes of the people, <b>and acceptable to all</b> of God’s <b>creatures.</b> |
| Proverbs 15:4 | study Torah, as it is stated: “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, | Arakhin 15b:16 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says: What is the remedy for those who speak malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah, as it is stated: “A soothing tongue is a tree of life,</b> but its perverseness is a broken spirit” (Proverbs 15:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tongue”</b> means <b>nothing other than malicious speech, as it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow;</b> it speaks deceit” (Jeremiah 9:7). <b>And</b> the word <b>“tree”</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them that lay hold of it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18). <b>And if he is an ignoramus,</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated: “Its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). In other words, one who perverts his tongue with malicious speech should remedy his behavior by cultivating a broken and humble spirit. |
| Proverbs 15:4 | but its perverseness is a broken spirit” | Arakhin 15b:17 | <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> If one has already <b>spoken</b> malicious speech, <b>he has no remedy, as</b> King <b>David,</b> inspired <b>by Divine Spirit, has already</b> cut him off with the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, as it is stated: “May the Lord cut off [<i>yakhret</i>] all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks great things”</b> (Psalms 12:4). <b>Rather, what is his remedy</b> beforehand, <b>so that he does not come to</b> speak <b>malicious speech? If he is a Torah scholar,</b> let him <b>study Torah; and if he is an ignoramus</b> let him <b>humble his mind, as it is stated:</b> “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, <b>but its perverseness is a broken spirit”</b> (Proverbs 15:4). One who is humble will not come to speak badly about another. |
| Proverbs 15:15 | which is written: “All the days of the poor are terrible; | Bava Batra145b:9 | <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “All the days of the poor are terrible;</b> and for the good-hearted it is always a feast” (Proverbs 15:15)? “All the days of the poor are terrible”; <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>master of Talmud,</b> who is wearied by the difficulty of his Talmud study. <b>“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to the <b>master of Mishna,</b> who recites the <i>mishnayot</i> by rote and is not wearied thereby. |
| Proverbs 15:15 | “All the days of the poor are terrible” | Sanhedrin 100b:11 | The verse states: <b>“All the days of the poor are terrible”</b> (Proverbs 15:15). The book of <b>ben Sira says: Also the nights</b> are terrible, as then the poor person worries. The poor person’s <b>roof is among the lowest roofs</b> in the city, <b>and in the elevation of the hills is his vineyard,</b> at the highest point, as those are of the lowest quality and consequently the least expensive places for each. <b>From the rain on the roofs</b> of the entire city, water will flow down <b>to his roof</b> and dampen it, <b>and the soil of his vineyard</b> is eroded by the rain and swept down <b>to</b> other <b>vineyards.</b> |
| Proverbs 15:15 | which is written: | Sanhedrin 100b:13 | <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “All the days of the poor are terrible, and for the good-hearted it is always a feast” (Proverbs 15:15)? <b>“All the days of the poor are terrible”; these are masters of the Talmud,</b> who invest constant effort in their study and encounter endless difficulties and questions. <b>“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; these are masters of the Mishna,</b> who study only halakhic conclusions and encounter no difficulties. |
| Proverbs 15:23 | from here: “A man has joy in the answer of his mouth; and a word in due season, how good it is” | Eruvin 54a:10 | <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “A man has joy in the answer of his mouth; and a word in due season, how good it is”</b> (Proverbs 15:23). <b>When does a man have joy? When an answer</b> related to Torah study <b>is in his mouth. Another version: When does a man have joy in the answer of his mouth? When</b> he experiences the fulfillment of: <b>A word in due season, how good it is,</b> i.e., when he knows when and how to address each issue. |
| Proverbs 15:23 | introduces good into the world, as it is stated: “And a word in its season, how good is it” | Sanhedrin 101a:3 | The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>says to</b> the Torah: <b>My daughter, during the time that they are eating and drinking, in what should they be engaged?</b> The Torah <b>says before Him: Master of the Universe, if they are masters of the Bible, let them engage in</b> the study of the <b>Torah, Prophets, and Writings. If they are masters of the Mishna, let them engage in</b> the study of <b>the Mishna, in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i>, and in</b> the study of <b><i>aggada</i>.

| Proverbs 15:25 | the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “The Lord will destroy the house of the proud, | Berakhot 58b:1 | <b>The Sages taught: One who sees the houses of Israel inhabited</b> and tranquil <b>recites: Blessed…Who establishes the border of the widow.</b> One who sees them <b>in ruins he recites: Blessed…the true Judge.</b> One who sees <b>the houses of the nations of the world inhabited recites: “The Lord will destroy the house of the proud,</b> but He will establish the border of the widow” (Proverbs 15:25). <b>And</b> if he sees them <b>in ruins he recites: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance, shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1). |
| Proverbs 15:27 | as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live” | Bava Batra13b:4 | The Gemara rejects this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should <b>actually</b> be understood exactly <b>as it is taught. And with regard to what you said: What is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s reasoning?</b> Why can’t one of the parties say that they should divide the property and he will settle for less? It is <b>because</b> the second one <b>can say to him: If</b> you want me to compensate you with <b>money</b> for the difference between my share and your share, <b>I have no money to give you.</b> And if you wish to give it to me as <b>a gift, I am not at ease</b> with that, <b>as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27). The <i>baraita</i> indicates that there is a <i>halakha</i> of: Either you set a price or I will set a price, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yehuda. |
| Proverbs 15:27 | “He that hates gifts shall live” | Chullin 44b:10 | The Gemara cites an aphorism: <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Who is a Torah scholar? This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> In other words, when the status of his own animal is uncertain, he deems it prohibited without concern for his own monetary loss. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Who is</b> referred to by the verse: <b>“He that hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27)? <b>This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> He is careful to avoid deriving benefit from that which is not his own, and even from items that are his concerning which it is questionable whether or not they are permitted. |
| Proverbs 15:27 | as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live” | Kiddushin 59a:8 | <b>Rav Giddel did not descend to</b> claim this plot of land, <b>as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27), and therefore he did not wish to accept the land as a gift. <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>did not descend to it, because Rav Giddel</b> was already <b>engaging in</b> the acquisition of <b>it</b> when he acquired the land. In this manner, <b>this Sage did not descend to</b> take the plot of land, <b>and that Sage did not descend to</b> take care of <b>it, and it was called the land of the Sages.</b> |
| Proverbs 15:27 | say to them: Is it not pleasing to you that I should live, as it is written: “He that hates gifts shall live” | Megillah 28a:13 | The Gemara explains: <b>I never accepted gifts;</b> this is referring to conduct <b>such as that of Rabbi Elazar. When they would send him gifts from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not take</b> them, <b>and when they would invite him, he would not go</b> there, as he considered hospitality to be a type of gift. <b>He</b> would <b>say to them: Is it not pleasing to you that I should live, as it is written: “He that hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27)? In contrast, it was reported about <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> that <b>when they would send him</b> gifts <b>from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not accept</b> them, <b>but when they would invite him, he would go</b> there. <b>He said: They are honored by my</b> presence; therefore my visiting is not considered like I am taking a gift from them. |
| Proverbs 15:27 | when those who accept gifts proliferated, the days decreased and the years shortened, as it is written: “And he who hates gifts lives” | Sotah 47b:22 | <b>From</b> the time <b>when</b> women with <b>“stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes”</b> (Isaiah 3:16) <b>proliferated, the bitter waters</b> of a <i>sota</i> <b>proliferated,</b> as more people were suspected of committing adultery; <b>but they</b> eventually <b>ceased</b> when licentiousness became too widespread. <b>From</b> the time <b>when those who accept gifts proliferated, the days decreased and the years shortened, as it is written: “And he who hates gifts lives”</b> (Proverbs 15:27). <b>From</b> the time <b>when those with boastful [<i>zeḥuḥei</i>] hearts proliferated, dispute proliferated in Israel. From</b> the time <b>when the students of Shammai and Hillel who did not serve</b> their Rabbis <b>sufficiently proliferated, dispute proliferated in Israel, and the Torah became like two Torahs. From</b> the time <b>when those who accept charity from gentiles proliferated, the Jewish people were above and they below; the Jewish people ahead and they behind.</b> This last statement is a euphemism; it was the Jewish people that were below and behind, but the Gemara did not want to say so explicitly. |
| Proverbs 15:30 | good tidings have reached you, as it is written: “Good tidings make the bone fat” | Gittin 56b:4 | Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Be not distressed</b> or troubled, for <b>good tidings have reached you, as it is written: “Good tidings make the bone fat”</b> (Proverbs 15:30), and your feet have grown fatter out of joy and satisfaction. Vespasian said to him: <b>But what is the remedy?</b> What must I do in order to put on my shoe? Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Have someone with whom you are displeased come and pass before you, as it is written: “A broken spirit dries the bones”</b> (Proverbs 17:22). <b>He did this, and</b> his shoe <b>went on</b> his foot. Vespasian <b>said to him: Since you are so wise, why didn’t you come to</b> see <b>me until now?</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: But didn’t I</b> already <b>tell you?</b> Vespasian <b>said to him: I also told you</b> what I had to say. |
| Proverbs 16:4 | is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose and even the wicked for the day of evil” | Nedarim 22a:9 | § Apropos the verse “There the wicked cease from troubling,” the Gemara cites a related statement: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who gets angry, all kinds of Gehenna rule over him,</b> because anger causes him to transgress all kinds of severe sins, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore remove vexation from your heart and put away evil from your flesh”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:10), <b>and the evil</b> mentioned <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), which is interpreted to mean that ultimately the day of the evildoer in Gehenna will arrive. |
| Proverbs 16:4 | Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord made everything for His own purpose, and even the wicked for the day of evil” | Nedarim 40a:4 | <b>Rav said: Anyone who visits the ill is spared from the judgment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is he that considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the day of evil”</b> (Psalms 41:2). In this verse, the term <b>poor [<i>dal</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>ill, as it is stated</b> in the prayer of Hezekiah when he was ill: <b>“He will cut me off from the illness [<i>middalla</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 38:12). <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be derived <b>from this verse</b> in which Jonadab asked his sick friend Amnon, son of King David: “<b>Why, son of the king, are you so sick [<i>dal</i>] from morning to morning?”</b> (II Samuel 13:4). <b>And</b> the term <b>evil means nothing other</b> than <b>Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord made everything for His own purpose, and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), and the ultimate punishment of the evildoer is Gehenna. |
| Proverbs 16:4 | Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states, “All that the Lord has made is for His sake” | Shabbat 116b:7 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> Apropos the mishna, the Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nissan <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> and the Paschal lamb is offered but not roasted until Shabbat ends, <b>one flays the Paschal</b> lamb <b>up to the breast</b> to enable removal of the parts of the animal that are offered on the altar on Shabbat. One flays the rest of the animal after Shabbat. Further skinning is only to facilitate eating the animal, therefore, it does not override Shabbat; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And the Rabbis say: One flays it in its entirety.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who said one may flay only part of the animal, the <i>halakha</i> is understandable. <b>Since it has</b> already <b>been used for its divine purpose</b> of having its blood sprinkled on the altar, the animal no longer should be flayed. <b>But according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> for their opinion? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states, “All that the Lord has made is for His sake”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), meaning that a prohibited action is only permitted if its performance honors God. The Gemara asks: <b>And here, what</b> manifestation of <b>for His sake is there</b> in flaying the remaining hide from the Paschal lamb? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The Rabbis permitted removing the entire hide so <b>that</b> the sacrifice <b>will not putrefy. Rava said:</b> The Rabbis permitted removing the entire hide so <b>that the sacred sacrifices will not be left</b> in disgrace <b>like</b> a half-stripped <b>animal carcass</b> left unattended. |
| Proverbs 16:4 | his Maker, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose” | Shabbat 50b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> Ameimar and Rav Ashi, who permit use of <i>berada</i>, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold?</b> They hold <b>in accordance with that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person must wash his face, his hands, and his feet every day for</b> the sake of <b>his Maker, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose”</b> (Proverbs 16:4). Every beautiful thing that exists in the world sings the praise of God Who created beautiful things. Therefore, it is appropriate for one to beautify himself in praise of God. |
| Proverbs 16:4 | When the Sages heard of the matter, they said: Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as it is stated: “God made everything for His sake” | Yoma 38a:11 | <b>When the Sages heard of the matter, they said: Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as it is stated: “God made everything for His sake”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), <b>and</b> they let <b>the House of Avtinas return to their</b> original <b>station. The Sages sent for</b> the members of the House of Avtinas to reassume their previous position, <b>and they did not come. They doubled their wages and they came. Each day</b> until then <b>they would take</b> wages of <b>twelve <i>maneh</i>, and today</b> they take wages of <b>twenty-four <i>maneh</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Each day</b> they took <b>twenty-four</b> <i>maneh</i>, <b>and today</b> they take <b>forty-eight.</b> |
| Proverbs 16:5 | it is written here: “Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord” | Sotah 4b:10 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Any person who has arrogance within him</b> is considered <b>as if he were an idol worshipper,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there</b> concerning the destruction of idols: <b>“And you shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26). |
| Proverbs 16:5 | it is written here: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord” | Sotah 4b:12 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says:</b> Any person who has arrogance within him is considered <b>as if he engaged in sexual intercourse with all</b> of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5), <b>and it is written there,</b> at the end of the passage concerning forbidden sexual relationships: <b>“For all these abominations</b> have the men of the land done” (Leviticus 18:27). |
| Proverbs 16:5 | “Hand to hand, he shall not be unpunished” | Sotah 4b:14 | Having interpreted the phrase: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 16:5), the Gemara interprets the continuation of the verse. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Hand to hand, he shall not be unpunished”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)? <b>Rav says: Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse with an adulteress, even</b> if <b>he</b> were to have <b>attributed possession of heaven and earth to the Holy One, Blessed be He, just as Abraham our forefather</b> did, <b>that it is written with regard to him: “I have lifted up my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth”</b> (Genesis 14:22), <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b> Abraham is described as one whose hands were lifted to declare the glory of God, yet this verse declares that even if one who engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse were to use his hands in the same way, still, due to his sin, the verse says: “He shall not be unpunished.” |
| Proverbs 16:5 | “Everyone that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord” | Sotah 5a:17 | <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Even a Torah scholar <b>should not have any</b> arrogance <b>or any part of</b> arrogance, i.e., not even one-eighth of one-eighth. He explains why arrogance should be avoided entirely by asking: <b>Is it a small</b> matter <b>that it is written with regard to</b> arrogance: <b>“Everyone that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)? |
| Proverbs 16:6 | as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated” | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 16:7 | “When a man’s ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him” | Moed Katan16b:5 | <b>In the end</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>came</b> on that same day. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>asked him: Why have you come?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>responded: Because</b> you, <b>Master, sent</b> me a message that <b>I should come.</b> He said to him: <b>But I sent</b> you a second message <b>that you should not come. He responded: This</b> messenger that you sent, i.e., the first one, <b>I saw</b> him and I did as he said, <b>but that</b> messenger, i.e., the second one, <b>I did not see.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>“When a man’s ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him”</b> (Proverbs 16:7), as it was clear to him that Rabbi Ḥiyya had merited divine assistance. |
| Proverbs 16:10 | For it is stated: “A divine sentence is on the lips of the king” | Chagigah 14a:10 | <b>“Every support of bread”; these are masters of Talmud, as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled”</b> (Proverbs 9:5). <b>“And every support of water”; these are the masters of <i>aggada</i>, who draw people’s hearts like water by</b> means of <b><i>aggada</i>. “The mighty man”; this is the master of halakhic tradition,</b> one who masters the <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to him from his rabbis. <b>“And the man of war”; this is one who knows how to engage in the discourse of Torah,</b> generating novel teachings <b>in the war of Torah. “A judge”; this is a judge who judges a true judgment truthfully. “A prophet”; as it literally indicates. “A diviner”; this is a king.</b> Why is he called a diviner? <b>For it is stated: “A divine sentence is on the lips of the king”</b> (Proverbs 16:10). <b>“An elder”; this is one fit for</b> the position of head of <b>an academy.</b> |
| Proverbs 16:14 | as it is stated: “The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it” | Bava Batra116a:15 | The Gemara presents the third homiletic interpretation: <b>Rabbi Pineḥas bar Ḥama interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: Anyone who has a sick person in his home should go to a sage, and</b> the sage will <b>ask</b> for <b>mercy on</b> the sick person’s behalf, <b>as it is stated: “The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it”</b> (Proverbs 16:14). |
| Proverbs 16:18 | “Pride goes before destruction” | Megillah 15b:16 | <b>Rabba says:</b> Esther invited Haman to her banquet in order to fulfill that which is stated: <b>“Pride goes before destruction”</b> (Proverbs 16:18), which indicates that in order to destroy the wicked, one must first bring them to pride. It can be understood according to <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say</b> that she invited Haman in order to fulfill the verse: <b>“When they are heated, I will make feasts for them,</b> and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep” (Jeremiah 51:39). The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Avuh</b> once <b>happened upon Elijah</b> the Prophet and <b>said to him: In accordance with whose understanding did Esther see</b> fit to <b>act in this manner?</b> What was the true reason behind her invitation? <b>He,</b> Elijah, <b>said to him:</b> Esther was motivated by all the reasons previously mentioned and did so <b>for all</b> the reasons previously stated by <b>the <i>tanna’im</i> and all</b> the reasons stated by <b>the <i>amora’im</i>.</b> |
| Proverbs 16:26 | as it is stated: “The hunger of the laborer labors for him; for his mouth presses upon him” | Sanhedrin 99b:1 | <b>Sing every day, sing every day,</b> i.e., review your studies like a song that one sings over and over. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says:</b> From <b>what verse</b> is this derived? It is <b>as it is stated: “The hunger of the laborer labors for him; for his mouth presses upon him”</b> (Proverbs 16:26), i.e., he exhausts his mouth through constant review and study. <b>He labors</b> in Torah <b>in this place,</b> this world, <b>and his Torah labors for him in another place,</b> the World-to-Come. |
| Proverbs 16:26 | states: “For his mouth presses upon him” | Sanhedrin 99b:2 | <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Every man was created for labor, as it is stated: “Man is born for toil”</b> (Job 5:7). Based on this verse, <b>I do not know whether he was created for toil of the mouth,</b> speech, or <b>whether he was created for the toil of labor. When</b> the verse <b>states: “For his mouth presses upon him”</b> (Proverbs 16:26), <b>you must say</b> that <b>he was created for toil of the mouth. And still I do not know</b> with regard to the toil of the mouth <b>whether it is for the toil of Torah or for the toil of conversation. When</b> the verse <b>states: “This Torah scroll shall not depart from your mouth”</b> (Joshua 1:8), <b>you must say</b> that <b>he was created for the toil of Torah. And that is</b> the meaning of <b>what Rava said: All bodies are like receptacles</b> to store items until use. <b>Happy is one who is privileged, who is a receptacle for Torah.</b> |
| Proverbs 17:5 | “He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator” | Berakhot 18a:6 | The Gemara further challenges: We concluded that, in both cases, if it is <b>his deceased</b> relative or if he was <b>watching over</b> the unrelated deceased, <b>he is</b> exempt from mitzvot. <b>However, one walking in a cemetery is not</b> exempt. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head and a Torah scroll in his arm and read</b> from it? <b>If one does so he commits</b> a transgression <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). As the deceased is incapable of fulfilling mitzvot, fulfilling a mitzva in his presence is seen as mocking him. |
| Proverbs 17:5 | “Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker” | Menachot 41a:18 | The Gemara comments: <b>At that time,</b> i.e., a person’s burial, <b>we certainly affix</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> the shroud, <b>because</b> otherwise it would be a violation of: <b>“Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). If we did not place them, it would be mocking the deceased, as if to taunt him that now he is no longer obligated in mitzvot. |
| Proverbs 17:5 | “Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker” | Sotah 43b:15 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: A corpse occupies four cubits</b> with regard <b>to</b> the exemption from <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> so that it is prohibited to recite <i>Shema</i> within this space, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). Because the deceased cannot perform mitzvot, one who performs a mitzva in front of them is considered to be mocking them. |
| Proverbs 17:10 | preferable to one hundred lashes, as it is stated: “A rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes to a fool” | Berakhot 7a:22 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: A single regret</b> or pang of guilt <b>in one’s heart is preferable to many lashes</b> administered by others that cause only physical pain, <b>as it is stated: “And she chases her lovers,</b> but she does not overtake them; she seeks them, but she will not find them; <b>and she will say ‘I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better for me then than now’”</b> (Hosea 2:9). Remorse is more effective than any externally imposed punishment listed in the verses that follow (Hosea 2:11–19). <b>And Reish Lakish said</b> that in the Bible, it seems that such remorse is <b>preferable to one hundred lashes, as it is stated: “A rebuke enters deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred lashes to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 17:10). |
| Proverbs 17:13 | “who rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house” | Ketubot 53a:12 | <b>Ravin bar Ḥanina sat before Rav Ḥisda, and he sat and said</b> the following <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: One who forgoes her</b> right to collect her <b>marriage contract</b> from <b>her husband does not</b> receive her <b>sustenance</b> from him. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Had you not said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to me in the name of a great man, I would have said to you</b> that this is an injustice, in accordance with the verse <b>“who rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house”</b> (Proverbs 17:13). After she relinquishes to her husband her right to her marriage contract, which was a favor to her husband, she loses her sustenance as well. |
| Proverbs 17:14 | Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says: The beginning of a person’s judgment is only concerning matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The beginning of judgment is as one lets out water” | Kiddushin 40b:11 | <b>And just as study</b> comes <b>before action,</b> i.e., the mitzva of Torah study takes precedence over other mitzvot, <b>so too,</b> the <b>judgment</b> concerning Torah study <b>precedes</b> the judgment for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says: The beginning of a person’s judgment is only concerning matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The beginning of judgment is as one lets out water”</b> (Proverbs 17:14). This is understood to refer to the sin of neglecting Torah, as the Torah is compared to water, which brings life to the world. |
| Proverbs 17:14 | after you hear their statements and you know where the judgment is leaning, you are not permitted to say to them: Go out and mediate, as it is stated: “The beginning of strife is as when one releases water; therefore leave off contention before the quarrel breaks out” | Sanhedrin 6b:11 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> If <b>two</b> litigants <b>come before you for a judgment, before you hear their</b> respective <b>statements</b> and claims; <b>or after you hear their statements but you do not</b> yet <b>know where the judgment is leaning,</b> meaning that it is not yet clear to the judge which party is in the right, <b>you</b> are <b>permitted to say to them: Go out and mediate.</b> But <b>after you hear their statements and you know where the judgment is leaning, you are not permitted to say to them: Go out and mediate, as it is stated: “The beginning of strife is as when one releases water; therefore leave off contention before the quarrel breaks out”</b> (Proverbs 17:14). Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya interprets the verse to mean: <b>Before</b> the resolution of <b>the contention is revealed, you can cast it off. Once</b> the resolution of <b>the contention is revealed, you cannot cast it off.</b> |
| Proverbs 17:14 | “The beginning of strife is as when one releases water” | Sanhedrin 7a:5 | <b>And</b> with regard to <b>those <i>tanna’im</i></b> who did not interpret the verse: <b>“The beginning of strife is as when one releases water”</b> (Proverbs 17:14), with regard to compromise, <b>what do they derive from</b> this verse? They understand the verse <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says: The beginning of a person’s judgment</b> after he dies is that he is <b>judged only concerning matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The beginning of strife is as when one releases water.”</b> Based on this verse, <b>Rav Huna says: This quarrel</b> between people is <b>comparable to</b> a split in <b>a hose</b> caused by <b>a burst of water,</b> emptying into a field; <b>once</b> the split in the hose <b>widens, it widens</b> even more and can no longer be repaired. To save the field, the hose must be repaired as soon as it splits. The same is true with regard to a quarrel; it must be stopped as soon as it begins. |
| Proverbs 17:14 | “The beginning of strife is as when one releases water” | Sanhedrin 7a:8 | There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was saying as he walked: It is good</b> for a person <b>who hears</b> statements said against him <b>and</b> yet <b>remains silent,</b> as <b>a hundred misfortunes pass him by</b> as a result. Upon hearing this, <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: A verse</b> is <b>written</b> that conveys the message of this aphorism: <b>“The beginning of strife is as when one releases water”</b> (Proverbs 17:14). The words “beginning [<i>poter</i>] of strife [<i>reishit madon</i>]” allude to: <b>The beginning of one hundred litigations [<i>reish me’a dinei</i>].</b> Troubles are avoided if one overlooks and excuses [<i>poter</i>] an offense. |
| Proverbs 17:16 | which is written: “Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, as he has no heart?” | Yoma 72b:11 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, as he has no heart?”</b> (Proverbs 17:16)? This expresses the following sentiment: <b>Woe to them, haters of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for the Torah scholars themselves, <b>who immerse themselves in Torah and have no fear of Heaven.</b> They are fools; they try to acquire the wisdom of Torah, but since they have no fear of Heaven in their hearts they lack the ability to do so. |
| Proverbs 17:17 | a brother to Heaven, as it is written: “And a brother is born for adversity” | Sanhedrin 102b:5 | § The Gemara proceeds to discuss the second king enumerated in the mishna, Ahab. <b>Ahab [<i>Aḥav</i>],</b> although he was <b>a brother [<i>aḥ</i>] to Heaven,</b> he was <b>a father [<i>av</i>] for idol worship.</b> He was <b>a brother to Heaven, as it is written: “And a brother is born for adversity”</b> (Proverbs 17:17), and in desperate times, he turned to Heaven. He was <b>a father for idolatry.</b> This is the highest level of attachment, <b>as it is written: “As a father has compassion for his children”</b> (Psalms 103:13). |
| Proverbs 17:22 | said to him: Have someone with whom you are displeased come and pass before you, as it is written: “A broken spirit dries the bones” | Gittin 56b:4 | Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Be not distressed</b> or troubled, for <b>good tidings have reached you, as it is written: “Good tidings make the bone fat”</b> (Proverbs 15:30), and your feet have grown fatter out of joy and satisfaction. Vespasian said to him: <b>But what is the remedy?</b> What must I do in order to put on my shoe? Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Have someone with whom you are displeased come and pass before you, as it is written: “A broken spirit dries the bones”</b> (Proverbs 17:22). <b>He did this, and</b> his shoe <b>went on</b> his foot. Vespasian <b>said to him: Since you are so wise, why didn’t you come to</b> see <b>me until now?</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: But didn’t I</b> already <b>tell you?</b> Vespasian <b>said to him: I also told you</b> what I had to say. |
| Proverbs 17:26 | it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good” | Avodah Zarah4b:9 | Upon awakening, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said:</b> I can <b>conclude from</b> the fact that I fell asleep that it is <b>not proper conduct to do this,</b> to curse people, even if they are wicked, as the verse: <b>“And His tender mercies are over all His works”</b> (Psalms 145:9) <b>is written</b> even with regard to sinners. <b>And</b> moreover, it is inappropriate to cause the punishment of another, as <b>it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good”</b> (Proverbs 17:26). Even for a righteous person, it is improper to punish another. |
| Proverbs 17:26 | it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good” | Berakhot 7a:20 | Moreover, it is inappropriate to cause the punishment of another, as <b>it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good”</b> (Proverbs 17:26), even for a righteous person, it is improper to punish another. |
| Proverbs 17:26 | as it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good” | Sanhedrin 105b:9 | The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain heretic who was in Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s neighborhood who would upset him</b> by incessantly challenging the legitimacy of biblical verses. <b>One day,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>took a rooster and tied it by its legs and sat</b> and waited. <b>He said: When that moment</b> of God’s wrath <b>arrives, I will curse him. When that moment</b> of God’s wrath <b>arrived,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>dozed off.</b> When he awakened, <b>he said: Conclude from</b> the fact that I dozed off that it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to curse even the wicked, <b>as it is written: “Punishment, even for the righteous, is not good”</b> (Proverbs 17:26). <b>Even with regard to heretics,</b> a righteous person <b>should not state</b> a curse in order to punish them. |
| Proverbs 17:26 | from here: “Punishment is also not good for the righteous” | Shabbat 149b:9 | <b>Rather,</b> the basis for this idea is <b>from here: “Punishment is also not good for the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 17:26), meaning that it is not good for a righteous person to issue punishment. <b>There is no</b> meaning of <b>not good other than evil. And it says: “For You are not a God that desires wickedness, evil will not dwell with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), meaning that <b>You, God, are righteous and evil shall not dwell</b> with You <b>in Your place of dwelling.</b> Even a righteous person who punishes someone and is called evil and cannot dwell within God’s partition. |
| Proverbs 17:28 | a fool, when he holds his peace, is considered wise; | Pesachim 99a:1 | <b>From here the Sages stated: Silence is fitting for the wise,</b> and <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> the same is true <b>for fools.</b> In the case under discussion, had neither side appointed the other to slaughter the Paschal lamb on its behalf, both offerings would be valid and would be consumed. When each side appointed the other to slaughter the Paschal lamb on its behalf, only the first one slaughtered may be eaten while the second one must be burned. This is <b>as it is stated:</b> “Even <b>a fool, when he holds his peace, is considered wise;</b> and he that shuts his lips is esteemed as a man of understanding” (Proverbs 17:28). |
| Proverbs 18:1 | which is written: “He that separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom” | Horayot 10b:14 | <b>Rava taught, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who taught: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 18:1)? <b>“He that separates himself seeks his own desire”; that is Lot, who separated from Abraham</b> to pursue his lust. <b>“And snarls [<i>yitgalla</i>] against all sound wisdom”; his shame was revealed [<i>shenitgalla</i>] in synagogues and study halls,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> concerning his offspring is taught; <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 76a): <b>An Ammonite and a Moabite,</b> descendants of Lot, <b>are forbidden</b> with <b>a permanent prohibition.</b> |
| Proverbs 18:1 | which is written: “He who separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom” | Nazir 23b:2 | On the same issue, <b>Rava expounded</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 18:1)? <b>“He who separates himself seeks his own desire,” this is Lot,</b> who separated from Abraham. <b>“And snarls [<i>yitgala</i>] against all sound wisdom,”</b> this too describes Lot, <b>as his shame was</b> eventually <b>revealed [<i>nitgala</i>] in the synagogues,</b> when his actions recorded in the Torah are read in public, <b>and in the study halls,</b> where the <i>halakhot</i> of his descendants are taught. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An Ammonite and a Moabite are prohibited</b> from entering the congregation by marrying a Jewish woman, <b>and their prohibition is permanent.</b> |
| Proverbs 18:3 | comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach” | Sanhedrin 113b:3 | <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach”</b> (Proverbs 18:3). When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>is eliminated from the world, good comes into the world, as it is stated: “And when the wicked perish there is jubilation”</b> (Proverbs 11:10). When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>passes from the world, evil comes into the world, as it is stated: “The righteous perishes and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken, none understand that due to the evil the righteous is taken”</b> (Isaiah 57:1) When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>comes into the world, good comes into the world</b> with him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“This is one who shall comfort us for our work and the toil of our hands”</b> (Genesis 5:29). |
| Proverbs 18:5 | from here: “It is not good to raise the face of the wicked” | Megillah 28a:18 | According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, Abimelech’s curse was the cause of Isaac’s blindness, and it was not, as Rabbi Elazar suggested, the fact he gazed at Esau. The Gemara explains: Both <b>this and that</b> jointly <b>caused it. Rava said:</b> The prohibition against gazing at the likeness of a wicked person is derived <b>from here: “It is not good to raise the face of the wicked”</b> (Proverbs 18:5). |
| Proverbs 18:5 | “It is not good to respect the person of the wicked” | Yoma 87a:2 | § It was further taught: <b>“It is not good to respect the person of the wicked”</b> (Proverbs 18:5), meaning, <b>it is not good for wicked people when they are respected in this world</b> and are not punished for their sins. For example, <b>it</b> was <b>not good for Ahab to be respected in this world, as it is stated: “Because he humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days”</b> (I Kings 21:29), and Ahab thereby lost his share in the World-to-Come. |
| Proverbs 18:5 | to turn aside the righteous in judgment” | Yoma 87a:3 | The opposite is also true. The complete verse states: “It is not good to respect the person of the wicked, <b>to turn aside the righteous in judgment”</b> (Proverbs 18:5), meaning: <b>It is good for the righteous when they are not respected in this world</b> and are punished in this world for their sins. For example, <b>it</b> was <b>good for Moses that he was not respected in this world, as it is stated: “Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me”</b> (Numbers 20:12). The Gemara analyzes this: <b>Had you believed in Me, your time still would not have come to depart the world.</b> |
| Proverbs 18:13 | as it is written in the book of ben Sira: I have weighed everything in the pan of a balance scale and I have not found anything inferior to bran; but inferior to bran is a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house; and inferior to a son-in-law is a guest who brings in a guest; and inferior to a guest is one who answers a matter before he listens. As it is stated: “He that gives an answer before he listens, it is folly for him and a disgrace” | Bava Batra98b:6 | Support for this is <b>as it is written in the book of ben Sira: I have weighed everything in the pan of a balance scale and I have not found anything inferior to bran; but inferior to bran is a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house; and inferior to a son-in-law is a guest who brings in a guest; and inferior to a guest is one who answers a matter before he listens. As it is stated: “He that gives an answer before he listens, it is folly for him and a disgrace”</b> (Proverbs 18:13). |
| Proverbs 18:19 | which is written: “A brother betrayed a strong city, and their contentions are like the bars of a castle” | Horayot 10b:13 | Apropos Lot, <b>Rabba taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A brother betrayed a strong city, and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother betrayed a strong city”; that is Lot, who parted from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> is stated <b>because he,</b> i.e., Lot, <b>introduced contention between Israel and Ammon, as it is stated: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4). |
| Proverbs 18:19 | and their contentions are like the bars of a castle” | Nazir 23b:1 | <b>and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city,” this is Lot,</b> called Abraham’s brother (see Genesis 14:14), <b>who separated from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle,”</b> this is <b>because</b> Lot <b>brought contention</b> between the Jewish people and his own descendants <b>like bars,</b> which lock the gates of <b>a castle.</b> Just as no one can enter a locked castle, so too Lot’s descendants, Ammon and Moab, were prevented from joining the Jewish people, as it states: <b>“An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4). |
| Proverbs 18:20 | about himself: “A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth” | Chullin 59b:6 | <b>And this is the uncertainty</b> that arose concerning the <b><i>karkoz</i> goat,</b> i.e., whether it is considered a domesticated animal. As there was <b>a certain <i>karkoz</i> goat that was in the house of the Exilarch, from which</b> they <b>removed a full basket of fat</b> after slaughtering it. <b>Rav Aḥai deemed</b> the fat <b>forbidden,</b> because he considered it a domesticated animal. But <b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu, ate of it. He read</b> the verse <b>about himself: “A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth”</b> (Proverbs 18:20). In other words, due to his learning, he knew it was permitted to eat the fat of the <i>karkoz</i> goat. |
| Proverbs 18:21 | tongue” | Arakhin 15b:22 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Death and life are in the hand of</b> the <b>tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21). <b>Does the tongue have a hand?</b> Rather the verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a hand can kill, so too a tongue can kill. If</b> you were to claim that <b>just as the hand kills only from close by, so too the tongue kills only from close by,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). The tongue kills like an arrow that is fired from a bow, at a great distance. |
| Proverbs 18:21 | “Death and life are in the hand of the tongue” | Arakhin 15b:25 | The Gemara further asks: <b>But since it is written: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Death and life are in the hand of the tongue”</b> (Proverbs 18:21), which merely teaches that a tongue can kill? The Gemara answers: This verse is necessary <b>for</b> a statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: One who wants life</b> can attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> which he can use for speaking appropriately and studying Torah. <b>One who wants death</b> can also attain it <b>by</b> means of <b>his tongue,</b> by using it for inappropriate and malicious speech. |
| Proverbs 18:22 | As it is said: “He who finds [ matza ] a wife finds [ matza ] good | Berakhot 8a:9 | Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22). |
| Proverbs 18:22 | Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Once a man marries a woman his iniquities crumble [ mitpakekin ], as it is stated: “Whoever finds a wife finds good, and obtains [ veyafek ] favor of the Lord” | Yevamot 63b:4 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Once a man marries a woman his iniquities crumble [<i>mitpakekin</i>], as it is stated: “Whoever finds a wife finds good, and obtains [<i>veyafek</i>] favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 18:22). <b>In the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>when a man married a woman they would say to him as follows: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motze</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom if the appropriate passage for his wife is that verse, which begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: Whoever finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds good,</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motze</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motze</i>] more bitter than death the woman”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). |
| Proverbs 18:23 | which is written: “The poor man speaks entreaties, but the rich man answers with impudence” | Sanhedrin 44a:13 | <b>Rav Naḥman says that Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The poor man speaks entreaties, but the rich man answers with impudence”</b> (Proverbs 18:23)? <b>“The poor man speaks entreaties”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Moses,</b> who addressed God in a tone of supplication and appeasement. <b>“But the rich man answers with impudence”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Joshua,</b> who spoke to God in a belligerent manner. |
| Proverbs 18:24 | as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own hurt” | Berakhot 63a:15 | Several ethical tenets and guidelines for life <b>were taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One should never have too many friends in his house,</b> i.e., people should not become accustomed to being overly intimate in his house, <b>as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own hurt”</b> (Proverbs 18:24); one with friends of that kind will ultimately come to quarrel. |
| Proverbs 18:24 | says: A person should never have many friends inside his house, as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own detriment” | Sanhedrin 100b:7 | <b>Rather,</b> perhaps the book poses a difficulty <b>because it is written</b> there: <b>Prevent the multitudes from inside your house, and do not bring everyone into your house</b> (Ben Sira 11:37). <b>But didn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also say it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A person should never have many friends inside his house, as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own detriment”</b> (Proverbs 18:24), as through his association with them he will become weak and be ruined. |
| Proverbs 19:2 | as it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins” | Eruvin 100b:14 | The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> derived from the verse mentioned in the previous discussion. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: It is prohibited for a man to force his wife in the</b> conjugal <b>mitzva,</b> i.e., sexual relations, <b>as it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). The term his feet is understood here as a euphemism for intercourse. |
| Proverbs 19:2 | “Also, that the soul without knowledge is not good” | Eruvin 100b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anyone who forces his wife to</b> perform <b>the</b> conjugal <b>mitzva will have unworthy children</b> as a consequence. <b>Rav Ika bar Ḥinnana said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Also, that the soul without knowledge is not good”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). If intercourse takes place without the woman’s knowledge, i.e., consent, the soul of the offspring will not be good. |
| Proverbs 19:2 | that it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins” | Eruvin 100b:7 | <b>Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: It is prohibited for a person to walk on grass on Shabbat, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). This verse teaches that mere walking occasionally involves a sin, e.g., on Shabbat, when one might uproot the grass on which he walks. |
| Proverbs 19:3 | “The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart frets against the Lord” | Taanit 9a:5 | The Gemara relates another story about the precociousness of this child. <b>And furthermore,</b> on a different occasion <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found</b> the <b>young son of Reish Lakish, when he was sitting</b> and studying <b>and</b> he was <b>reciting</b> the verse: <b>“The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart frets against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 19:3). This verse means that when someone sins and every manner of mishap befalls him, he complains and wonders why these things are happening to him. |
| Proverbs 19:10 | and it is written: “Luxury is not seemly for a fool” | Chullin 133a:16 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who teaches</b> Torah <b>to an unworthy student</b> is considered <b>like one who throws a stone to Markulis, as it is stated: “As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that gives honor to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 26:8), <b>and it is written: “Luxury is not seemly for a fool”</b> (Proverbs 19:10). |
| Proverbs 19:14 | From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord” | Moed Katan18b:15 | <b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili as follows: From the Torah, and from the Prophets, and from the Writings;</b> it implies that the decree that a specific <b>woman</b> is destined to be married <b>to</b> a specific <b>man</b> is <b>from God.</b> From where is this derived? It is <b>from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord,</b> we cannot speak to you either bad or good” (Genesis 24:50). <b>From the Prophets, as it is written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord”</b> (Judges 14:4). <b>From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 19:14). |
| Proverbs 19:16 | from here: “But he who despises his ways shall die” | Niddah 16b:11 | § <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day. Rav Hamnuna says: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is stated: “Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night on which it was said: Conceived is a man-child”</b> (Job 3:3). It is derived from here that <b>nighttime is meant for conception, but daytime is not meant for conception. Reish Lakish says</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “But he who despises his ways shall die”</b> (Proverbs 19:16). One might see something unpleasing in his wife in the daylight and come to despise her. |
| Proverbs 19:17 | which is written: “He that graciously gives to the poor makes a loan to the Lord, | Bava Batra10a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that graciously gives to the poor makes a loan to the Lord,</b> and that which he has given, He will pay him back” (Proverbs 19:17)? How can it be that one is considered to have granted a loan to God? <b>Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> that somebody who is gracious to a poor person is seen as lending to God. It would be impertinent, since <b>“the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), <b>as it were.</b> |
| Proverbs 19:17 | “He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord, | Berakhot 18a:12 | <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who sees the deceased</b> taken to burial <b>and does not escort him has committed a transgression due to</b> the verse: <b>“He who mocks the poor blasphemes his Creator.” (Proverbs 17:5) And if he does escort him, what is his reward? Rav Asi said: The verse says about him: “He who gives to the poor gives a loan to the Lord,</b> and the Lord will repay him” (Proverbs 19:17), and: “He who oppresses the poor blasphemes his Creator, <b>but he who is gracious to the poor honors Him”</b> (Proverbs 14:31). |
| Proverbs 19:21 | is not effective; as it is stated: “There are many devices in a man’s heart; but the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand” | Sanhedrin 26b:10 | <b>Rabba says: If</b> people <b>engage</b> in Torah study <b>for its own sake,</b> concern <b>is not effective; as it is stated: “There are many devices in a man’s heart; but the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand”</b> (Proverbs 19:21). Rabba interprets this to mean that <b>a counsel that has in it the statement of the Lord shall rise forever</b> and cannot be disturbed. |
| Proverbs 19:23 | Rabbi Zeira said: One who goes seven nights without a dream, is called evil, as it is stated: “He who has it will abide satisfied [ save’a ], he will not be visited by evil” | Berakhot 14a:18 | Having mentioned his name, the Gemara tangentially cites what <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: One who goes seven nights without a dream, is called evil, as it is stated: “He who has it will abide satisfied [<i>save’a</i>], he will not be visited by evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). Rabbi Yona reinterprets the verse: <b>Do not read <i>save’a</i>, satisfied, but <i>sheva</i>, seven.</b> One who sleeps for seven nights without being visited by a dream, is called evil. |
| Proverbs 19:23 | as it is stated: “And he that has it shall lie satisfied [ vesave’a ], he shall not be visited with evil” | Berakhot 55b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>And when he does not see</b> a dream, <b>is</b> that <b>a virtue? Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say: Anyone who sleeps seven days without a dream is called evil,</b> as it indicates that God does not wish to appear to him even in that indirect manner. Allusion to this is, <b>as it is stated: “And he that has it shall lie satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], he shall not be visited with evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). The Sages said: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], rather</b> read it as <b>seven [<i>vesheva</i>],</b> which is an allusion to the fact that one who sleeps seven times and does not experience a dream is considered evil. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that David saw dreams <b>and the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>says as follows:</b> David certainly <b>saw</b> dreams, <b>but he did not understand what he saw.</b> |
| Proverbs 20:1 | it is written: “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whosoever wallows in it is not wise” | Gittin 68a:11 | <b>When</b> Ashmedai <b>came he checked his seal, opened</b> the pit, and <b>found it</b> to be filled with <b>wine. He said</b> that <b>it is written: “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whosoever wallows in it is not wise”</b> (Proverbs 20:1), <b>and it is written: “Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart”</b> (Hosea 4:11). He concluded: <b>I will not drink</b> this wine. Eventually, <b>when he became thirsty, he was unable to</b> resist the wine and <b>he drank, became intoxicated, and fell asleep.</b> |
| Proverbs 20:5 | but a man of understanding will draw it out” | Pesachim 54a:1 | <b>but a man of understanding will draw it out”</b> (Proverbs 20:5). <b>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; that is</b> a reference to <b>Ulla,</b> who had a thought but did not articulate it. <b>But a man of understanding will draw it out; that is</b> a reference to <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> who understood the allusion even though it was not articulated. The Gemara asks: <b>And in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do</b> Ulla and Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>hold,</b> leading them to reject Rabbi Abba’s statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion? The Gemara answers: They hold <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites the blessing over fire both at the conclusion of Shabbat and at the conclusion of Yom Kippur. And that is</b> how <b>the people act.</b> |
| Proverbs 20:14 | because it is written: “It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer; | Bava Batra84a:4 | It is necessary to teach this, <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this is not a case of exploitation <b>because it is written: “It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer;</b> but when he is gone his way, then he boasts” (Proverbs 20:14). In other words, it is the usual manner of sellers to praise their merchandise, while buyers disparage it. Therefore, the mishna teaches that the buyer can renege on the sale if the item was found to be bad, and the seller can change his mind if it was found to be good. |
| Proverbs 20:16 | from here: “Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman” | Bava Batra173b:11 | <b>Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman”</b> (Proverbs 20:16). The verse advises a creditor to take the garment of the debtor’s guarantor as payment for the loan. |
| Proverbs 20:16 | And similarly it states: “Take his garment that is a surety for a stranger” | Bava Metzia115a:4 | § <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). This verse indicates that <b>you may not enter his house, but you</b> may <b>enter the house of a guarantor</b> to take collateral from him. <b>And similarly it states: “Take his garment that is a surety for a stranger”</b> (Proverbs 20:16). |
| Proverbs 20:25 | “And after vows to make inquiry” | Nedarim 22a:3 | <b>Rabbi Abba said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that taking a vow leads to one’s deeds being examined? It is <b>“And after vows to make inquiry”</b> (Proverbs 20:25). This is interpreted to mean that after one takes a vow, his actions are reviewed in heaven. The Gemara comments: <b>And although Rabbi Yannai broached</b> dissolution <b>with him</b> in this way, <b>we do not broach</b> dissolution <b>in this</b> manner <b>for</b> one who vows, by asking if he regrets it because his actions will be examined in heaven. This is because one might be embarrassed, upon hearing such a question, to say that he does not have regret, and he will claim untruthfully that he is regretful. |
| Proverbs 20:25 | as though he slapped the cheek of the Divine Presence; as it is stated: “It is a snare [ mokesh ] for a man to rashly say [ yala ]: Holy” | Sanhedrin 58b:18 | <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: One who slaps the cheek of a Jew</b> is considered <b>as though he slapped the cheek of the Divine Presence; as it is stated: “It is a snare [<i>mokesh</i>] for a man to rashly say [<i>yala</i>]: Holy”</b> (Proverbs 20:25). The verse is interpreted homiletically to mean: One who strikes [<i>nokesh</i>] a Jew is considered as though he hurt the cheek [<i>lo’a</i>] of the Holy One. |
| Proverbs 20:27 | as it is written: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts” | Pesachim 7b:15 | <b>And searching</b> is derived <b>from lamps</b> by means of juxtaposition, <b>as it is written:</b> “And it shall come to pass that <b>at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps”</b> (Zephaniah 1:12). <b>And</b> finally, the word <b>lamps</b> is derived <b>from lamp</b> by means of juxtaposition, <b>as it is written: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts”</b> (Proverbs 20:27). Together these verses indicate that the search for leaven must be conducted by the light of the lamp. |
| Proverbs 20:27 | and it says: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts” | Pesachim 8a:1 | <b>because the light of a lamp is effective for searching. And even though there is no proof for</b> this <b>matter, there is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter, as it is stated: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it says: “And he searched, starting with the eldest,</b> and ending with the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s sack…” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And it says: “At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps”</b> (Zephaniah 1:12), <b>and it says: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts”</b> (Proverbs 20:27). |
| Proverbs 20:27 | called ner , | Shabbat 30b:2 | Since David died in the garden, <b>Solomon sent</b> the following question <b>to the study hall: Father died and is lying in the sun, and the dogs of father’s house are hungry.</b> There is room for concern lest the dogs come and harm his body. What shall I do? <b>They sent</b> an answer <b>to him: Cut up an</b> animal <b>carcass and place it before the dogs.</b> Since the dogs are hungry, handling the animal carcass to feed them is permitted. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>your father,</b> it is prohibited to move his body directly. <b>Place a loaf</b> of bread <b>or an infant on top of him, and</b> you can <b>move him</b> into the shade due to the bread or the infant. <b>And</b> is it <b>not appropriate</b> what <b>Solomon said: “</b>F<b>or a living dog is better than a dead lion.”</b> The ultimate conclusion of this discussion is that life is preferable to death. <b>And</b> now, <b>with regard to the question that I asked before you;</b> Rav Tanḥum spoke modestly, as, actually, they had asked him the question. <b>A lamp is called <i>ner</i> and a person’s soul is</b> also <b>called <i>ner</i>,</b> as it is written: “The spirit of man is the lamp [<i>ner</i>] of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27). <b>It is preferable</b> that <b>the lamp of</b> a being of <b>flesh and blood,</b> an actual lamp, <b>will be extinguished in favor of the lamp of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a person’s soul. Therefore, one is permitted to extinguish a flame for the sake of a sick person. |
| Proverbs 20:27 | The soul that I have placed in you is called ner : | Shabbat 32a:1 | <b>I called you first,</b> as it is stated: “Israel is the Lord’s hallowed portion, His first fruits of the increase” (Jeremiah 2:3) <b>and I warned you about matters of the first:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart <i>ḥalla</i> for a gift” (Numbers 15:20). <b>The soul that I have placed in you is called <i>ner</i>:</b> “The spirit of man is the lamp [<i>ner</i>] of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27), and <b>I warned you about matters of the</b> Shabbat <b>lamp. If you fulfill these</b> mitzvot, <b>fine, and if not, then I will take your soul.</b> |
| Proverbs 20:30 | a sin, wounds and bruises emerge on him, as it is stated: “Sharp wounds for one devoted to evil | Shabbat 33a:10 | And in a similar vein, <b>Rav Oshaya said: Anyone who</b> prepares <b>himself to</b> commit <b>a sin, wounds and bruises emerge on him, as it is stated: “Sharp wounds for one devoted to evil</b>; so do stripes that reach the inward parts” (Proverbs 20:30). <b>And not only that, but</b> he <b>is sentenced to</b> suffer from the disease of <b>edema [<i>hidrokan</i>], as it is stated: So do stripes that reach the inward parts. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: A sign</b> indicating one who <b>committed</b> a sin is the disease <b><i>hidrokan</i>,</b> which afflicts the inner parts. |
| Proverbs 21:1 | A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses: | Berakhot 55a:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: Three</b> matters <b>require</b> a plea for <b>mercy</b> to bring them about: <b>A good king, a good year, and a good dream.</b> These three, kings, years, and dreams, are all bestowed by God and one must pray that they should be positive and constructive. The Gemara enumerates the sources for these cases: <b>A good king, as it is written: “The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the watercourses:</b> He turns it whithersoever He will” (Proverbs 21:1). A <b>good year, as it is written: “The eyes of the Lord, thy God, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). And a <b>good dream, as it is written:</b> “O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore <b>You will recover me [<i>vataḥlimeni</i>], and make me to live”</b> (Isaiah 38:16). Due to their apparent etymological similarity, the word <i>taḥlimeni</i> is interpreted as deriving from the word <i>ḥalom</i>, dream. |
| Proverbs 21:3 | offerings, as it is stated: “To perform charity and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than an offering” | Sukkah 49b:9 | § <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who performs</b> acts of <b>charity is greater than</b> one who sacrifices <b>all</b> types of <b>offerings, as it is stated: “To perform charity and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than an offering”</b> (Proverbs 21:3), including all types of offerings. <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Acts of kindness,</b> assisting someone in need, <b>are greater than charity, as it is stated: “Sow to yourselves according to charity, and reap according to kindness”</b> (Hosea 10:12). This means: <b>If a person sows,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>he</b> will <b>eat or</b> whether <b>he</b> will <b>not eat,</b> since much can go wrong before the seed becomes food. However, if <b>a person reaps, he certainly eats.</b> In this verse, charity is likened to sowing, while acts of kindness are likened to reaping. |
| Proverbs 21:9 | And from the altar to the roof, as it is written: “It is better to dwell in a corner of the roof | Rosh Hashanah31a:16 | <b>And from the threshold</b> of the Sanctuary the Divine Presence went <b>to the courtyard, as it is written: “And the House was filled with the cloud and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory”</b> (Ezekiel 10:4). <b>From the courtyard to the altar, as it is written: “I saw the Lord standing on the altar”</b> (Amos 9:1). <b>And from the altar to the roof, as it is written: “It is better to dwell in a corner of the roof</b> than in a house together with a contentious woman” (Proverbs 21:9). <b>From the roof to the wall, as it is written: “And behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb line”</b> (Amos 7:7). <b>From the wall to the city, as it is written: “The Lord’s voice cries to the city”</b> (Micah 6:9). |
| Proverbs 21:13 | “Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard” | Shabbat 55a:2 | The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yehuda was sitting before Shmuel</b> when <b>this woman came</b> and <b>cried before</b> Shmuel about an injustice that had been committed against her, <b>and</b> Shmuel <b>paid no attention to her.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Shmuel: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with the verse: <b>“Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard”</b> (Proverbs 21:13)? He <b>said to him: Big-toothed one, your superior</b>, i.e., I, your teacher, <b>will be</b> punished <b>in cold water. The superior of your superior will be</b> punished <b>in hot water. Mar Ukva, who sits as president of the court,</b> is responsible for those matters. |
| Proverbs 21:14 | charity it is written: “A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a present in the bosom fierce wrath” | Bava Batra9b:7 | § The Gemara resumes its discussion of the virtues of giving charity. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who performs</b> acts of <b>charity in secret is greater than Moses, our teacher. Whereas with regard to Moses, our teacher, it is written: “For I was afraid of the anger and the wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19), <b>with regard to one who performs</b> acts of <b>charity it is written: “A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a present in the bosom fierce wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14). The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> A secret gift <b>pacifies anger,</b> but it <b>does not pacify wrath, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom fierce wrath,”</b> meaning that <b>although a present is in the bosom,</b> i.e., even if one gives charity in secret, nevertheless <b>fierce wrath</b> can still harm him. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> as follows: <b>Any judge who accepts a bribe brings fierce wrath upon the world, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom</b> fierce wrath.” |
| Proverbs 21:14 | “A gift in secret pacifies wrath” | Sotah 5a:1 | <b>Even</b> if the one who committed adultery <b>performs charitable</b> deeds <b>secretly,</b> as alluded to in the phrase “hand to hand,” and even if one might think that one who does so will go unpunished, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to charity of this kind: <b>“A gift in secret pacifies wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14), nevertheless, <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:16 | Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who separates himself from the matters of Torah falls into Gehenna. As it is stated: “The man who strays out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the spirits” | Bava Batra79a:3 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who separates himself from the matters of Torah falls into Gehenna. As it is stated: “The man who strays out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the spirits”</b> (Proverbs 21:16). “The way of understanding” is the way of the Torah. <b>And</b> one who departs from the Torah arrives in the place of the <b>spirits,</b> which <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “But he does not know that the spirits are there; that those whom she has called are in the depths of the netherworld”</b> (Proverbs 9:18). |
| Proverbs 21:19 | And from the mountain to the wilderness, as it is written: “It is better to live in the wilderness | Rosh Hashanah31a:17 | <b>And from the city</b> the Divine Presence arose <b>to the mountain</b> nearest the Sanctuary, i.e., the Mount of Olives, <b>as it is written: “And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain, which is on the east side of the city”</b> (Ezekiel 11:23). <b>And from the mountain to the wilderness, as it is written: “It is better to live in the wilderness</b> than with a contentious and fretful woman” (Proverbs 21:19). <b>And from the wilderness it ascended and rested in its place</b> in Heaven, <b>as it is written: “I will go and return to My place</b> until they acknowledge their guilt” (Hosea 5:15). |
| Proverbs 21:21 | finds life” | Bava Batra10a:1 | “He who pursues charity and mercy, <b>finds life”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), and with regard to wisdom it is written: “He who finds Me, finds life” (Proverbs 8:35). <b>Masters of wealth, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy finds <b>charity,”</b> meaning he will be able to give charity. <b>Masters of <i>aggada</i>, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy, finds <b>honor.”</b> And how do we know that this refers to masters of <i>aggada</i>? <b>It is written here “honor,” and it is written there: “The wise shall inherit honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:35). |
| Proverbs 21:21 | which is written: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity, and honor” | Bava Batra9b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21)? Is this to say that <b>because one has pursued charity, he</b> himself <b>shall find charity?</b> That is, shall the reward of one who has always given charity be that he will eventually become poor and other people will act charitably toward him? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who pursues charity,</b> giving to the poor and leading others to do so, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, furnishes him with money with which to perform</b> his acts of <b>charity.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:21 | mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor” | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 21:21 | With regard to acts of loving kindness it is written: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness shall find life, prosperity, and honor” | Kiddushin 40a:5 | Rava cites the source for each of these assertions. <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16), which indicates that one is rewarded in this world. <b>With regard to acts of loving kindness it is written: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness shall find life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), all of which apply in this world. |
| Proverbs 21:21 | and it is written there: “He who pursues righteousness and mercy finds life, prosperity, and honor” | Yevamot 109b:1 | <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said: It is derived</b> by verbal analogy from the terms <b>pursuit</b> and <b>pursuit. It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15) <b>and it is written there: “He who pursues righteousness and mercy finds life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), indicating that pursuing peace is a mitzva, just as pursuing righteousness and mercy is. As <b>for the nullification of vows, this is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who vows, it is as if he built</b> a personal <b>altar</b> when it is prohibited to build an altar outside the Temple. <b>And one who fulfills that</b> vow, <b>it is as if he sacrificed an offering on this</b> personal altar, thereby doubling his sin. Therefore, it is preferable that he ask a halakhic authority to dissolve the vow. |
| Proverbs 21:23 | about him: “Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue, keeps his soul from troubles” | Bava Metzia83b:10 | <b>After his mind settled,</b> i.e., when his anger abated, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, regretted his hasty decision. <b>He went after</b> the laundryman in order <b>to ransom him</b> and save him from execution, <b>but he was unable</b> to do so. <b>He read</b> the verse <b>about him: “Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue, keeps his soul from troubles”</b> (Proverbs 21:23), i.e., had the laundryman not issued his derogatory comment he would have been spared this fate. Ultimately, <b>they hanged</b> the laundryman. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>stood beneath the gallows and wept.</b> Those who were present <b>said to him: Our teacher, let it not be bad in your eyes</b> that you caused his death, as this laundryman was a wholly wicked person; you should know <b>that he and his son</b> both <b>engaged in intercourse with a betrothed young woman on Yom Kippur.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:24 | Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Anyone who scoffs falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he acts in arrogant wrath” | Avodah Zarah18b:14 | <b>Rav Ketina says:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who scoffs, his sustenance is lessened, as it is stated: “He stretches out his hand with scorners”</b> (Hosea 7:5), meaning that God withdraws His providence from scoffers and does not provide for them. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Anyone who scoffs falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he acts in arrogant wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:24). <b>And wrath</b> means <b>nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Day of Judgment: <b>“That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). |
| Proverbs 21:24 | Anyone who is haughty falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he acts in arrogant wrath” | Avodah Zarah18b:15 | <b>Rabbi Oshaya says,</b> based on the same verse: <b>Anyone who is haughty falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, he acts in arrogant wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:24). <b>And wrath means nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). <b>Rabbi Ḥanilai bar Ḥanilai says: Anyone who scoffs causes extermination</b> to be wrought <b>upon the world, as it is stated: “Now therefore do not be scoffers, lest your suffering be made strong; for an extermination wholly determined have I heard</b> from the Lord, the God of hosts, upon the whole land” (Isaiah 28:22). |
| Proverbs 21:24 | a sin for them, since they perform them only in order to act haughtily through them, and whoever acts haughtily falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “The proud and haughty one, scorner is his name, acts in arrogant wrath” | Bava Batra10b:10 | <b>Rabban Gamliel answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel,</b> one nation on the earth.” <b>“But the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> means that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only in order to act haughtily through them, and whoever acts haughtily falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “The proud and haughty one, scorner is his name, acts in arrogant wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:24). <b>And wrath means nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). |
| Proverbs 21:27 | “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, | Berakhot 22b:17 | The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who was praying and</b> later <b>found feces in the place</b> where he prayed, <b>Rabba said: Although he committed a transgression</b> in his failure to examine that venue to determine if it was worthy of prayer (<i>Tosafot</i>), <b>his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer</b> and he fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rava strongly objects to his</b> statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it stated: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,</b> the more so as he offers it in depravity” (Proverbs 21:27), from which we derive that a mitzva performed inappropriately is no mitzva at all? Consequently, the fact that he did not pay proper attention invalidates his prayer. <b>Rather, Rava said: Because</b> this person <b>committed a transgression, although he prayed, his prayer is an abomination</b> and he must pray again. |
| Proverbs 21:27 | “The offering of the wicked is an abomination” | Sanhedrin 112b:3 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> They shall die, as it is written: <b>“The offering of the wicked is an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 21:27), and it is unacceptable for sacrifice on the altar. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> They shall die because the animal <b>is the property of its owner</b> and is not exclusively consecrated property. <b>And</b> the reason it is considered the property of the owner is that <b>here,</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring <b>to offerings</b> with regard to <b>which one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for their</b> replacement. That responsibility renders the status of these consecrated animals like that of his property. <b>And</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> An offering with regard to which one bears financial responsibility for its replacement <b>is the property of</b> its <b>owner.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:27 | “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination” | Shevuot 12b:11 | The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this positive mitzva</b> in the mishna? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he did not repent,</b> the offering cannot atone for him, as the verse states: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 21:27). <b>If he did repent,</b> then why is the mishna referring to Yom Kippur? He will achieve atonement on <b>any</b> other <b>day as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one transgressed a positive mitzva and repented, he does not move from there until he is forgiven.</b> |
| Proverbs 21:27 | “the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination” | Zevachim 7b:7 | <b>And Rava says: A burnt offering is a gift [<i>doron</i>]</b> to God; its essential purpose is not atonement. Rava supports his assertion: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which a burnt offering atones for violating a positive mitzva? <b>If</b> one brings a burnt offering <b>without repentance</b> for his transgression, he may not sacrifice it at all, as <b>“the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 21:27). <b>And if there is repentance, isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one <b>violates a positive mitzva and repents,</b> God <b>forgives him before he</b> even <b>moves from</b> his place? If so, why is he required to bring an offering? <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that a burnt offering <b>is a gift</b> that one brings in order to appease God even after he is forgiven. |
| Proverbs 21:29 | as it is stated: “A wicked man makes his face insolent” | Taanit 7b:9 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>any man who is insolent, it is permitted to call him wicked</b> to his face, <b>as it is stated: “A wicked man makes his face insolent”</b> (Proverbs 21:29). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “And the insolence of his face is changed”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“Is changed [<i>yeshunne</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Is hated [<i>yissane</i>],</b> as the two words are spelled the same way in Hebrew, albeit with different vocalization and pronunciation. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord” | Berakhot 19b:2 | We learned that some who come to console the bereaved are exempt from <i>Shema</i> as a means of honoring the deceased. The Gemara expands the discussion to raise the general question: To what degree does preserving human dignity take precedence over mitzvot enumerated in the Torah? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who discovers diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>],</b> i.e., a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>in his garment, must remove them even in the</b> public <b>marketplace.</b> He may not wait until he reaches home. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? As it is stated: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). From here, the general principle: <b>Anywhere that there is desecration of the Lord’s name, one does not show respect to the teacher,</b> is derived. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is no wisdom or understanding or council against the Lord” | Eruvin 63a:13 | Afterward, Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: Behavior <b>such as this,</b> the way I acted in your presence just now, <b>does</b> it <b>appear like irreverent</b> behavior? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> With regard to this it is stated: <b>“There is no wisdom or understanding or council against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). The Sages expounded this verse as follows: <b>Wherever a desecration of</b> God’s <b>name is involved, no respect is paid</b> even <b>to a teacher,</b> i.e., in such a situation one should disregard the respect due to his teacher’s wisdom and understanding and object to the inappropriate behavior. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is no wisdom or understanding or counsel against the Lord” | Moed Katan17a:2 | The Gemara clarifies the case: <b>For what</b> reason was he ostracized? <b>If</b> it was <b>for a matter relating to Heaven,</b> i.e., because he sinned, then why, if he was ostracized by the student, should he not be considered ostracized with regard to the teacher? Doesn’t the verse state: <b>“There is no wisdom or understanding or counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30)? This means that when a sin is committed and God’s name is desecrated, all other considerations are ignored, even the eminence and knowledge of the teacher, and therefore he too must treat the offender as ostracized. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the Gemara is referring to a case where the student ostracized the other person due to an insult <b>to his</b> own <b>dignity?</b> Therefore, it is apparent that his decree of ostracism is valid and binding upon all, with the exception of his teacher. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord” | Sanhedrin 82a:14 | <b>And Shmuel says:</b> Pinehas <b>saw</b> and considered the meaning of the verse: <b>“There is neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30), which the Sages interpreted to mean: <b>Anywhere that there is desecration of the Lord’s name, one does not show respect to the teacher.</b> In those situations, one need not consult his teacher, but must immediately proceed to right the wrong that is transpiring. Therefore, he took the spear and took immediate action. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> says that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He saw that an angel came and destroyed among the people</b> in punishment for the sin of Zimri, and he realized that he must take immediate action to ameliorate the situation. |
| Proverbs 21:30 | “There is neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord” | Shevuot 30b:10 | The Gemara notes: <b>This matter</b> applies only <b>with regard to</b> cases involving <b>monetary matters; but in</b> cases involving <b>ritual matters,</b> the dignity of the Torah scholar is not a consideration, as it is written: <b>“There is neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30), from which it is derived: <b>Wherever there is desecration of the name of the Lord, one does not show deference to the teacher.</b> Rather, the Torah scholar forgoes the honor due him in order to avoid violation of any prohibition that would desecrate the name of God. |
| Proverbs 22:2 | “the rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all” | Temurah 16a:17 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say</b> likewise with regard to the following verse: <b>“The poor man and the oppressor [<i>tekhakhim</i>] meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them”</b> (Proverbs 29:13). <b>When the student,</b> who is poor in his knowledge, <b>goes to his teacher,</b> i.e., one who knows enough to teach but requires further enlightenment himself, as he is a man between [<i>tokh</i>] the levels of a Sage and a commoner, <b>and says to him: Teach me Torah, if</b> the teacher agrees to <b>teach him,</b> then <b>the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them,</b> as they both become greater as a result. <b>But if</b> the teacher will <b>not</b> teach the student, then <b>“the rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all”</b> (Proverbs 22:2). This verse teaches that He <b>Who made this one wise</b> now <b>makes him foolish,</b> and He Who made <b>that one foolish</b> now <b>makes him wise. This is the exposition of Rabbi Natan.</b> |
| Proverbs 22:2 | “The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all” | Temurah 16a:19 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say</b> an interpretation with regard to the verse: <b>“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them”</b> (Proverbs 29:13). <b>When a poor</b> person <b>goes to a homeowner and says: Provide for me, if he provides for him,</b> that is <b>good. But if not,</b> then it is stated: <b>“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all”</b> (Proverbs 22:2). This verse indicates that He <b>Who made this one wealthy</b> now <b>makes him poor,</b> and He Who made <b>that one poor</b> now <b>makes him wealthy.</b> |
| Proverbs 22:3 | states: “A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself; but the thoughtless pass on, and are punished” | Keritot 9a:20 | It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Suddenly”; this</b> is referring to <b>an intentional</b> transgression, <b>and similarly</b> the verse <b>states: “A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself; but the thoughtless pass on, and are punished”</b> (Proverbs 22:3). The <i>tanna</i> interprets the expression “the thoughtless [<i>peta’im</i>]” as related to the word “suddenly [<i>pitom</i>],” and one can be punished, as the thoughtless are punished in the verse, but only for an intentional transgression. |
| Proverbs 22:5 | is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them” | Avodah Zarah3b:17 | The Gemara clarifies: <b>If you wish, say</b> that this applies <b>in this world, and if you wish, say</b> instead that it applies <b>to the World-to-Come. If you wish, say</b> that it applies <b>in this world, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina. As Rabbi Ḥanina says: All</b> occurrences that befall man <b>are in the hands of Heaven except for colds</b> and <b>obstacles [<i>paḥim</i>],</b> from which one is able to protect himself, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5). This indicates that cold and, conversely, heat, are forms of harm from which one must protect himself, which teaches that being exposed to excessive heat can cause death. |
| Proverbs 22:5 | is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them” | Bava Batra144b:6 | § The mishna teaches: If one of the brothers <b>became sick and sought treatment, the</b> cost of the <b>treatment is</b> paid <b>from his own</b> resources. <b>Ravin sent</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Ela: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he became ill through negligence. But</b> if he became ill <b>through circumstances beyond his control,</b> the cost of <b>the treatment is</b> paid <b>from the middle,</b> i.e., from the common inheritance. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances in</b> which it is considered <b>negligence?</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: All</b> occurrences that befall man <b>are in the hand of Heaven except for colds</b> and <b>obstacles [<i>paḥim</i>],</b> from which one is able to protect himself, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5). |
| Proverbs 22:5 | heat, as it is stated: “Cold and heat are on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them” | Bava Metzia107b:4 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: This</b> phrase: “All sickness,” refers to <b>the cold, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: All</b> occurrences that befall man are <b>at the hands of Heaven, except for</b> excess <b>cold</b> and <b>heat, as it is stated: “Cold and heat are on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5). This indicates that cold and heat are forms of harm caused by man, from which one can protect himself. |
| Proverbs 22:5 | heat are on the path of the crooked, he who guards his soul shall keep far from them” | Ketubot 30a:8 | The Gemara asks: <b>And are cold</b> and <b>heat at the hand of Heaven? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> matters are <b>at the hand of Heaven except for cold</b> and <b>heat, as it is stated: “Cold</b> and <b>heat are on the path of the crooked, he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5)? This indicates that cold and heat are forms of harm caused by man, from which one can protect himself. <b>And furthermore, are a lion and thieves</b> forms of harm <b>at the hands of man? But didn’t Rav Yosef say, and similarly,</b> didn’t <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the day that the Temple was destroyed, although the Sanhedrin was abolished</b> the <b>four death</b> penalties <b>were not abolished?</b> The Gemara asks: Were they <b>not abolished?</b> It is clear <b>that they were abolished,</b> as today there is neither Sanhedrin nor capital punishment. <b>Rather,</b> it means that although there are no court-imposed executions, |
| Proverbs 22:6 | “Train a child in the way that he should go” | Kiddushin 30a:2 | The Gemara notes that this is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> based on the verse: <b>“Train a child in the way that he should go”</b> (Proverbs 22:6). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagreed about the age in which the verse instructs the parent to educate his child: <b>One said</b> that the verse is referring to the ages <b>from sixteen until twenty-two, and one said</b> it is referring to the ages <b>from eighteen until twenty-four.</b> The dispute concerning the correct age for marriage and the dispute about educating a child are the same, as while a father still has a large measure of influence over his son, he must both teach him and find him a wife. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | “the borrower is servant to the lender” | Bava Batra10a:15 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that graciously gives to the poor makes a loan to the Lord,</b> and that which he has given, He will pay him back” (Proverbs 19:17)? How can it be that one is considered to have granted a loan to God? <b>Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> that somebody who is gracious to a poor person is seen as lending to God. It would be impertinent, since <b>“the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), <b>as it were.</b> |
| Proverbs 22:7 | “The borrower is a servant to the lender” | Bava Batra171b:10 | <b>Abaye objects to this</b> line of reasoning: <b>Rather, what</b> should the <i>halakha</i> be, that one <b>writes a receipt</b> when the creditor cannot find the promissory note? If <b>the receipt of</b> the debtor <b>is lost, should this</b> creditor <b>eat and rejoice?</b> Once the debtor has lost his receipt, there is nothing to prevent the creditor from collecting the debt a second time. This, too, is unfair. In either case, whether a receipt is written or not, an injustice could result. Why should it be preferred that the potential of suffering an injustice should be borne by the debtor rather than the creditor? <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> it is preferable, because, as it is written: <b>“The borrower is a servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). The debtor’s interests are subordinated to those of the creditor. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | the borrower is servant to the lender” | Bava Batra51a:11 | The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <b>as</b> it is <b>uncomfortable for him to make</b> applicable to <b>himself</b> the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <b>the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | the borrower is servant to the lender” | Bava Batra51b:3 | The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <b>as</b> it is <b>uncomfortable for a person to be</b> described by the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <b>the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | “The borrower is a slave to the lender” | Gittin 14a:18 | <b>Ultimately, he escaped them</b> and did not perform the act of acquisition. <b>When</b> Rav Yosef <b>came before</b> Rav Sheshet and told him what had occurred, Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: You did well, as you did not render yourself</b> the subject of the verse: <b>“The borrower is a slave to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), by obligating yourself for no reason. In <b>another version</b> of this incident Rav Sheshet said to Rav Yosef: <b>You did well,</b> as the verse states: <b>“The borrower is a slave to the lender,”</b> i.e., the merchants who borrowed from me must bear responsibility to ensure that the money will reach me. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | “The borrower is servant to the lender” | Rosh Hashanah31b:5 | Ameimar <b>said to him: This applies only to testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month,</b> for which it is necessary to have a fixed place. The reason is <b>that if so,</b> if the witnesses come to court when the head of the court is absent and they will have to go to another place, <b>consequently you will be obstructing them for future</b> occasions, as they will consider it too much trouble and perhaps they will not come the next time. Therefore, the Sages said that these witnesses should go to the regular place where the Great Sanhedrin meets. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to monetary claims, the verse states: <b>“The borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), i.e., the defendant must act as is convenient to the claimant and the court. |
| Proverbs 22:7 | “The borrower is servant to the lender” | Sanhedrin 31b:16 | <b>Ameimar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that if one litigant wants to go to the place of the Assembly and the other does not, the latter <b>is compelled to go to the place of the Assembly. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>he is compelled</b> to appear and <b>be judged</b> in a court that presides <b>in his</b> own <b>city?</b> Ameimar answered: <b>This statement</b> applies in a case <b>where the borrower said to the lender:</b> Let us go to the place of the Assembly; in that case, the debtor is compelled to be judged in his city. <b>But</b> if the <b>lender</b> requests to go to the place of the Assembly, his request is accepted, as it is stated: <b>“The borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). |
| Proverbs 22:9 | with generosity and gave it to the Jewish people. And about him, the verse says: “He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed, | Nedarim 38a:4 | <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The Torah was given</b> initially <b>only to Moses and his descendants, as it is stated: “Write for you”</b> (Exodus 34:27), and it is also stated: <b>“Hew for you”</b> (Exodus 34:1), meaning: <b>Just as their waste is yours, so too their writing is yours.</b> However, <b>Moses treated</b> the Torah <b>with generosity and gave it to the Jewish people. And about him, the verse says: “He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed,</b> as he gives of his bread to the poor” (Proverbs 22:9). |
| Proverbs 22:9 | as it is stated: “One who has a good eye will be blessed [ yevorakh ], for he gives of his bread to the poor” | Sotah 38b:10 | <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One may give a cup of blessing to recite the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals <b>only to</b> someone with <b>a good eye,</b> i.e., a generous person, <b>as it is stated: “One who has a good eye will be blessed [<i>yevorakh</i>], for he gives of his bread to the poor”</b> (Proverbs 22:9). <b>Do not read</b> it: “<b>Will be blessed.” Rather,</b> read it: <b>Will bless [<i>yevarekh</i>].</b> |
| Proverbs 22:10 | Rava said: It is a mitzva to divorce a bad wife, as it is written: “Cast out the scorner and contention will depart; strife and shame will cease” | Yevamot 63b:5 | <b>Rava said: It is a mitzva to divorce a bad wife, as it is written: “Cast out the scorner and contention will depart; strife and shame will cease”</b> (Proverbs 22:10). <b>And Rava said: A bad wife whose marriage contract</b> settlement <b>is</b> too <b>large</b> for her husband to pay in the event of a divorce, <b>her rival wife is at her side.</b> In other words, the only way for him to improve matters is to take another wife. <b>As people say</b> in the well-known adage: The way to trouble a woman is <b>with her peer and not with a thorn. And Rava said: A bad wife is as troublesome as a day of heavy rain, as it is stated: “A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike”</b> (Proverbs 27:15). |
| Proverbs 22:14 | ” | Shabbat 33a:9 | The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>But His hand is stretched out still? Rabbi Ḥanan bar Rava said: Everybody knows why the bride enters the wedding canopy.</b> There is no secret revealed. <b>Nevertheless, anyone who speaks vulgarly</b> about it, <b>even if they,</b> on High, <b>sealed for him a decree of seventy years of good</b> fortune<b>, they will reverse it to bad</b> fortune because of this sin. And <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Anyone who speaks vulgarly, they deepen Gehenna for him, as it is stated: “The mouth that speaks perversity is a deep pit</b>: he that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein<b>”</b> (Proverbs 22:14), i.e., Gehenna is deepened for one who speaks vulgarly. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even</b> one <b>who hears</b> vulgar speech <b>and is silent</b> is punished, <b>as it is stated: “He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein,”</b> even if he himself does not speak at all. |
| Proverbs 22:17 | Reish Lakish said: Rabbi Meir found a verse and interpreted it homiletically: “Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to My knowledge” | Chagigah 15b:7 | <b>Reish Lakish said: Rabbi Meir found a verse and interpreted it homiletically: “Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to My knowledge”</b> (Proverbs 22:17). <b>It does not state “to their knowledge,” but “to My knowledge.”</b> In other words, one must listen to the words of <b>the Sages,</b> despite their flaws, provided that their opinion concurs with that of God. |
| Proverbs 22:18 | that which is written: “For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; let them be firmly attached together to your lips” | Eruvin 54a:9 | The Gemara continues with praise for Torah study and knowledge. <b>Rav Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; let them be firmly attached together to your lips”</b> (Proverbs 22:18)? <b>When are words of Torah pleasant? When you keep them within you</b> and know them. <b>And when will you keep them within you? When they will be attached together to your lips,</b> i.e., when you articulate them audibly and expound them. |
| Proverbs 22:18 | “For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within your belly; let them be established on your lips” | Sanhedrin 99b:3 | The verse states: <b>“He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding”</b> (Proverbs 6:32). <b>Reish Lakish says: This is</b> a reference to <b>one who studies Torah intermittently,</b> who is like an adulterer, who sins with the other woman intermittently, <b>as it is stated</b> about words of Torah: <b>“For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within your belly; let them be established on your lips”</b> (Proverbs 22:18) and keep the Torah always available. |
| Proverbs 22:20 | “Have I not written for you three times” | Megillah 7a:4 | It was related that <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rav Ḥaviva taught</b> the statement cited below. The Gemara comments: <b>Throughout the order of <i>Moed</i>, wherever this</b> latter <b>pair</b> of Sages is mentioned, <b>exchange Rabbi Yoḥanan and insert Rabbi Yonatan</b> in his place. They said: <b>Esther sent to the Sages: Write me for</b> future <b>generations</b> and canonize my book as part of the Bible. <b>They sent to her</b> that it is written: <b>“Have I not written for you three times”</b> (Proverbs 22:20), indicating that Israel’s battle with Amalek is to be mentioned <b>three times</b> in the Bible <b>and not four times?</b> Since it is already mentioned three times (Exodus 17:8–16; Deuteronomy 25:17–19; I Samuel 15), there is no need to add a fourth source. |
| Proverbs 22:22 | as it is written: “Do not rob from the weak because he is weak, nor crush the poor in the gate” | Bava Metzia112a:3 | The Gemara cites proof for these two opinions. <b>The one who says</b> it is referring to <b>the soul of the robber</b> bases his opinion on a verse, <b>as it is written: “Do not rob from the weak because he is weak, nor crush the poor in the gate”</b> (Proverbs 22:22), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those who spoil them”</b> (Proverbs 22:23). This indicates that God will take the soul of one who steals from a poor person. <b>And the one who says</b> it is referring to <b>the soul of the robbery victim</b> bases his opinion on a verse, <b>as it is written: “So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; it takes away the life of its owners”</b> (Proverbs 1:19). A robber is considered as if he removed the very soul of his victim. |
| Proverbs 22:23 | “For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those who spoil them” | Bava Metzia112a:3 | The Gemara cites proof for these two opinions. <b>The one who says</b> it is referring to <b>the soul of the robber</b> bases his opinion on a verse, <b>as it is written: “Do not rob from the weak because he is weak, nor crush the poor in the gate”</b> (Proverbs 22:22), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those who spoil them”</b> (Proverbs 22:23).

A robber is considered as if he removed the very soul of his victim. |
| Proverbs 22:27 | “If you have nothing with which to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?” | Rosh Hashanah6a:4 | It was necessary to say that the lateness is not imputed to the other members of one’s household for the following reason: <b>It might enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> who said: <b>A person’s wife dies only because</b> others <b>demand of him money and he does not have</b> means with which to pay, <b>as it is stated</b> about one who commits himself to guarantee a loan: <b>“If you have nothing with which to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27). The verse warns one who takes a loan that incurring debt may result in one losing the very sheets that he sleeps on to his creditor. The Gemara understands this homiletically: Why should you cause God to take away your wife, i.e., she who shares your bed, so that she dies? Consequently, you might <b>say that</b> one’s <b>wife also dies for this transgression</b> of the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> in that one fails to fulfill his commitment. Therefore, <b>the verse teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, this sin is imputed to him alone. |
| Proverbs 22:27 | as it is stated: “If you do not have with what to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?” | Sanhedrin 22a:17 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, and some say Rabbi Elazar, says: A man’s wife does not die unless</b> his creditors <b>ask him for money</b> that he owes <b>and he does not have</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “If you do not have with what to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27). The bed mentioned in the verse alludes to one’s wife. |
| Proverbs 22:27 | as it is stated: “If you have not the wherewithal to pay, why should He take away your bed from under you?” | Shabbat 32b:2 | <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: Due to the sin of vows</b> unfulfilled <b>a person’s wife dies.</b> The allusion is <b>as it is stated: “If you have not the wherewithal to pay, why should He take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Due to the sin of vows</b> unfulfilled, <b>children die when they are young, as it is stated:</b> “Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay. <b>Suffer not your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt, neither say you before the messenger that it was an error; wherefore should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:4–5). <b>What is the work of a person’s hands? You must say</b> that it is <b>a person’s sons and daughters.</b> |
| Proverbs 22:27 | as it is stated: “If you do not have with what to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?” | Zevachim 29b:5 | The Gemara responds: <b>Ben Azzai requires that</b> verse to teach a different <i>halakha</i>: The phrase <b>“and it will be sin in you”</b> indicates that there will be sin in you, <b>but</b> there will <b>not</b> be <b>sin in your wife.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Elazar said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>A man’s wife does not die unless</b> his creditors <b>ask him for money</b> that he owes <b>and he does not have</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “If you do not have with what to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27); therefore, one’s wife <b>also dies for this transgression of</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> since one has failed to fulfill his commitment. Consequently, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the sin is imputed to him alone. |
| Proverbs 22:29 | “Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall stand not before obscure men” | Sanhedrin 104b:14 | <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to</b> the members of the Great Assembly: <b>“Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall stand not before obscure men”</b> (Proverbs 22:29). See the greatness of Solomon, <b>who preceded</b> construction of <b>My House,</b> the Temple, <b>to</b> the construction of <b>his house. Moreover, My House he built</b> quickly, <b>in</b> just <b>seven years, and his house he constructed in thirteen years.</b> Therefore, <b>“he shall stand before kings; he shall stand not before obscure men,”</b> and it is inappropriate to enumerate him among the wicked. <b>And they paid it no heed. A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Shall His recompense be as you will it? For you loathe it, so that you must choose, and not I?</b> Therefore, speak what you know” (Job 34:33). Only God, and not the people, determines who has a share in the World-to-Come. |
| Proverbs 23:2 | said to him: “And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite” | Chullin 6a:2 | § The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages,</b> Rabban Gamliel and his court, <b>issued a decree</b> rendering it prohibited to eat from the slaughter of Samaritans? The Gemara answers: It is <b>like that</b> case <b>involving Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> in which <b>Rabbi Meir dispatched him to bring wine from the area of the Samaritans. A certain elder found him</b> and <b>said to him: “And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite”</b> (Proverbs 23:2),as a warning to distance himself from them and not to drink their wine, because they were not reliable. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar went and related</b> those <b>matters before Rabbi Meir, and</b> Rabbi Meir <b>issued a decree against them.</b> |
| Proverbs 23:5 | as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone; | Berakhot 5a:5 | <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> upon his bed, demons stay away from him.</b> This is alluded to, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But man is born into trouble, <b>and the sparks [<i>reshef</i> ] fly [<i>uf</i> ] upward”</b> (Job 5:7). The verse is explained: The word <b>fly [<i>uf</i> ]</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah,</b> as Torah is difficult to grasp and easy to lose, like something that floats away, <b>as it is stated: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone;</b> for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies into the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5). The word <b>“sparks”</b> means <b>nothing other than demons, as it is stated: “Wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the sparks [<i>reshef</i>] and bitter destruction [<i>ketev meriri</i>],</b> and the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of the dust” (Deuteronomy 32:24). Here we see <i>reshef</i> listed along with <i>ketev meriri</i>, both of which are understood by the Sages to be names of demons. |
| Proverbs 23:5 | hata’if ] your eyes upon it? It is gone” | Chagigah 13b:9 | The Gemara asks: <b>Which of</b> the wings <b>were diminished? Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Those with which they recite song.</b> The proof is that <b>it is written here: “And with two it flew</b> [<b><i>yeofef</i></b>]. <b>And one called to the other and said”</b> (Isaiah 6:2–3), <b>and it is written: “Will you set</b> [<b><i>hata’if</i>] your eyes upon it? It is gone”</b> (Proverbs 23:5), implying that the flight of these wings had ceased. |
| Proverbs 23:5 | with your eyes? It is already gone” | Megillah 18b:14 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Rabbi Meir is different, as in him is fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“And let your eyelids look straight before you”</b> (Proverbs 4:25), and with regard to this verse, <b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti: What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“and let your eyelids</b> [<b><i>afapekha</i>],”</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>“look straight</b> [<b><i>yaishiru</i></b>] <b>before you”? He said to him: This is referring to the words of the Torah,</b> which are difficult to remember exactly, <b>and with regard to which it is written: “Will you glance upon it fleetingly</b> [<b><i>hata’if</i> ],</b> from the root <i>a-p-p</i>, <b>with your eyes? It is already gone”</b> (Proverbs 23:5), <b>but nevertheless they remain exact</b> [<b><i>meyusharin</i></b>] in the memory of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> since he knows them all by heart. |
| Proverbs 23:5 | that it is written: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone” | Sotah 35a:22 | <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Matters of Torah</b> are so difficult and demanding <b>that it is written: “Will you set your eyes upon it? It is gone”</b> (Proverbs 23:5), i.e., one whose eyes stray from the Torah even for a moment will forget it, and <b>you call</b> them <b>songs?</b> For this reason <b>I will cause you to stumble in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written</b> with regard to the wagons brought to the Tabernacle: <b>“And to the descendants of Kohath he did not give, because the service of the holy things</b> belongs to them; they carry them upon their shoulders” (Numbers 7:9). <b>And</b> although the Ark clearly must be carried on people’s shoulders, David erred and <b>brought it in a wagon.</b> |
| Proverbs 23:15 | “My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine” | Berakhot 4a:13 | <b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 23:15 | “My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will be glad, even Mine” | Eruvin 21b:16 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that</b> King <b>Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards <b>and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, which are added safeguards to the words of the Torah, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will be glad, even Mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15). <b>And it states</b> with regard to him: <b>“My son, be wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond to he who taunts Me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 23:15 | “My son, if your heart is wise my heart will be glad, even mine” | Shabbat 14b:7 | The Gemara asks further: <b>Still,</b> the matter is not clear, as the decree of hands was <b>issued</b> by King <b>Solomon. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i> and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), and so too: <b>“My son, be wise and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27: 11). The Gemara responds: <b>Came</b> |
| Proverbs 23:17 | And it says: “One shall not envy the unjust, but be in fear of the Lord all the day” | Berakhot 7b:17 | The Gemara cites proof from another verse. <b>And it says: “One shall not envy the unjust, but be in fear of the Lord all the day”</b> (Proverbs 23:17). In this context, to envy means to seek to emulate the unjust. |
| Proverbs 23:17 | “Let not your heart envy sinners, | Megillah 6b:7 | <b>Rather,</b> the true meaning of that verse is: <b>“Contend not with evildoers,” to be like the evildoers; “nor be envious against the workers of iniquity,” to be like the workers of iniquity. And it says</b> elsewhere: <b>“Let not your heart envy sinners,</b> but be in the fear of the Lord all the day” (Proverbs 23:17). In this context, to be envious of sinners means to desire to be like them. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Dostai indicate that one is permitted to provoke the wicked, against the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak. |
| Proverbs 23:20 | as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers [ besovei ], among gluttonous eaters [ bezolelei ] of meat” | Sanhedrin 70a:4 | The mishna summarizes: If <b>he ate an item that</b> involves performing <b>a mitzva or an item that</b> involves committing <b>a transgression,</b> or if <b>he ate any food</b> in the world <b>but did not eat meat,</b> or if he <b>drank any beverage but did not drink wine, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son, unless he</b> actually <b>eats meat and</b> actually <b>drinks wine, as it is stated:</b> “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not listen to our voice; he…<b>is a glutton [<i>zolel</i>] and a drunkard [<i>vesovei</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:20). One is not called a glutton and a drunkard unless he eats meat and drinks wine. <b>And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof to the matter</b> that the reference in the Torah is to meat and wine, <b>there is an allusion to the matter</b> in another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers [<i>besovei</i>], among gluttonous eaters [<i>bezolelei</i>] of meat”</b> (Proverbs 23:20). |
| Proverbs 23:20 | as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers, among gluttonous eaters of meat” | Sanhedrin 71a:3 | <b>And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof to the matter,</b> there is <b>an allusion to the matter</b> in another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers, among gluttonous eaters of meat”</b> (Proverbs 23:20). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags”</b> (Proverbs 23:21). That is to say, a person who is a glutton and a drunkard, and sleeps a lot due to his excessive eating and drinking, will end up poor and dressed in rags. <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> expounds the same verse and <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who sleeps in the study hall, his Torah shall become tattered, as it is stated: “And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.”</b> |
| Proverbs 23:21 | states: “For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags” | Sanhedrin 71a:3 | <b>And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof to the matter,</b> there is <b>an allusion to the matter</b> in another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Be not among wine drinkers, among gluttonous eaters of meat”</b> (Proverbs 23:20). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags”</b> (Proverbs 23:21). That is to say, a person who is a glutton and a drunkard, and sleeps a lot due to his excessive eating and drinking, will end up poor and dressed in rags. <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> expounds the same verse and <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who sleeps in the study hall, his Torah shall become tattered, as it is stated: “And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.”</b> |
| Proverbs 23:22 | And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old” | Berakhot 54a:9 | The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah. |
| Proverbs 23:22 | “And despise not your mother when she is old” | Berakhot 63a:7 | The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say: Boaz said this on his own,</b> and it proves nothing with regard to normative practice, <b>come and hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it was an angel who said</b> this <b>to Gideon,</b> that perhaps this verse was the angel informing Gideon that the Lord is with him, but it is not the standard formula of a greeting, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the verse: <b>“And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22); the customs of the nation’s elders are an adequate source from which to derive <i>halakha</i>. |
| Proverbs 23:23 | Torah, with regard to which it is written: Truth, as it is written: “Buy the truth, and sell it not” | Avodah Zarah4b:13 | <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the order. Rather, this is the reason that an individual should not recite the additional prayer during the first three hours of the day when God is engaged in Torah study: In the case of the <b>Torah, with regard to which it is written: Truth, as it is written: “Buy the truth, and sell it not”</b> (Proverbs 23:23), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not act</b> in a manner that is <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b> But with regard to <b>judgment, with regard to which it is not written: Truth,</b> but it is a process that involves mercy and compromise, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> can <b>act</b> in a manner that is <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b> |
| Proverbs 23:23 | payment? The verse states: “Buy the truth, | Bekhorot 29a:8 | <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, <b>as the Lord my God commanded me”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:5). <b>Just as I</b> learned from God <b>for free, so too, you</b> learned from me <b>for free. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>cannot find</b> someone to teach him <b>for free that he should learn</b> even <b>by</b> giving <b>payment? The verse states: “Buy the truth,</b> and do not sell it; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one <b>should not say: Just as I learned by</b> giving <b>payment, so too, I will teach it by</b> receiving <b>payment? The verse states: “Buy the truth, and do not sell it.”</b> |
| Proverbs 23:23 | And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it; | Berakhot 5b:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> What is your source for this? <b>Granted,</b> if one engages in <b>Torah and acts of charity,</b> his transgressions are forgiven, <b>as it is written: “With mercy and truth, iniquity is expiated”</b> (Proverbs 16:6); <b>mercy refers to acts of charity, as it is stated: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), mercy and charity are listed together. <b>And truth refers to Torah, as it is stated: “Buy truth and do not sell it;</b> also wisdom, guidance and understanding” (Proverbs 23:23). <b>However, from where is it derived</b> that the transgressions of <b>one who buries his sons</b> are also forgiven? |
| Proverbs 23:25 | About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice” | Berakhot 19a:11 | <b>What is</b> the source for the third case, <b>one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven?</b> The mishna relates that Ḥoni HaMe’aggel, the circle-drawer, drew a circle and stood inside it, and said that he would not leave the circle until it rained, and he went so far as to make demands in terms of the manner in which he wanted the rain to fall. After it rained, <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, relayed to <b>Ḥoni HaMe’aggel:</b> Actually, <b>you should be ostracized</b> for what you said, <b>and if you were not Ḥoni, I would have decreed ostracism upon you, but what can I do? You nag God and He does your bidding, like a son who nags his father and</b> his father <b>does his bidding</b> without reprimand. After all, the rain fell as you requested. <b>About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25). Apparently, one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven would ordinarily merit excommunication. |
| Proverbs 23:25 | About you, the verse states: “Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her who bore you rejoice” | Taanit 19a:9 | <b>Shimon ben Shetaḥ,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin at the time, <b>relayed to</b> Ḥoni HaMe’aggel: <b>Were you not Ḥoni, I would have decreed that you be ostracized, but what can I do to you?

After all, rain fell as you requested. <b>About you, the verse states: “Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her who bore you rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25). |
| Proverbs 23:25 | gives him. About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice” | Taanit 23a:10 | <b>However, what can I do to you, as you nag God and He does your bidding, like a son who nags his father and</b> his father <b>does his bidding. And</b> the son <b>says to</b> his father: <b>Father, take me to be bathed in hot water; wash me with cold water; give me nuts, almonds, peaches, and pomegranates. And</b> his father <b>gives him. About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25). |
| Proverbs 23:27 | as it is written: “For a zona is a deep pit” | Bava Kamma16b:21 | The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a <i>zona</i>, this is</b> because the word “pit” is used as a metaphor for a <i>zona</i>, <b>as it is written: “For a <i>zona</i> is a deep pit”</b> (Proverbs 23:27). <b>But according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him</b> of engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman,</b> for <b>what</b> reason did Jeremiah use the word <b>“pit”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Due to</b> the fact that she is <b>a married woman, should she be excluded from the category of a <i>zona</i>?</b> If she commits adultery she is also termed a <i>zona</i>, and the term “pit” can justifiably be applied to her. |
| Proverbs 23:31 | “Do not look upon the wine when it is red, | Bava Batra97b:10 | <b>Rav Kahana, father-in-law of Rav Mesharshiyya, asked Rava:</b> With regard to using <b>white wine</b> for libations and for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him</b> in response that the verse states: <b>“Do not look upon the wine when it is red,</b> when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly” (Proverbs 23:31), which indicates that red wine is considered to be of a superior quality. |
| Proverbs 23:31 | “Look not upon the wine when it is red” | Menachot 87a:8 | <b>Rather, Rava said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse exhorting a person not to be enticed by fine wines: <b>“Look not upon the wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). Evidently, the redness of wine is indicative of its quality. After a year, wine begins to lose its redness and so it should not be used, <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, it is still of a sufficient quality to be acceptable, after the fact. |
| Proverbs 23:31 | of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “Look not upon wine when it is red” | Pesachim 108b:7 | The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the cup from which one drinks <b>must have</b> the <b>taste and appearance</b> of wine. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “Look not upon wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). This verse proves that the appearance of wine and not only its taste is important. |
| Proverbs 23:31 | which is written: “Look not upon wine when it is red” | Sanhedrin 70a:13 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Look not upon wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31)? <b>Look not upon wine that reddens the faces of the wicked in this world</b> when they drink it, <b>and whitens their faces,</b> i.e., embarrasses them, <b>in the World-to-Come. Rava says</b> that this is how the verse should be understood: <b>“Look not upon wine that reddens [<i>yitaddam</i>]”</b> means: <b>Look not upon wine, as it leads to bloodshed [<i>dam</i>],</b> indicating that one who drinks wine will end up committing an act of killing or will be killed because of it. |
| Proverbs 23:31 | when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly [ bemeisharim ]” | Yoma 74b:16 | § Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the Gemara continues with another dispute they had with regard to the correct interpretation of a verse. It is stated: “Do not look upon the wine when it is red, <b>when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly [<i>bemeisharim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagreed. <b>One said: Whoever casts</b> |
| Proverbs 24:4 | And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person in whom there is knowledge ultimately becomes wealthy, as it is stated: “And by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant riches” | Sanhedrin 92a:11 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person in whom there is knowledge ultimately becomes wealthy, as it is stated: “And by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant riches”</b> (Proverbs 24:4). |
| Proverbs 24:6 | “For by wise advice you shall make your war” | Sanhedrin 42a:6 | The Gemara presents another statement, citing Rabbi Aḥa, citing Rabbi Asi, citing Rabbi Yoḥanan. The verse states: <b>“For by wise advice you shall make your war”</b> (Proverbs 24:6). <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In whom do you find the war,</b> i.e., the ability to engage in disputes, <b>of Torah? In one who has in his possession bundles,</b> i.e., vast knowledge, <b>of Mishna.</b> One must first learn the primary sources before engaging in disputes of Torah. <b>Rav Yosef would read concerning himself</b> the verse: <b>“And much produce comes by the strength of the ox”</b> (Proverbs 14:4), i.e., one with great strength can bring a large yield. Rav Yosef was known to be particularly well-versed in tannaitic statements. |
| Proverbs 24:10 | lack the strength to stand on a day of adversity, as it is stated: “If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed” | Berakhot 63a:22 | <b>Rabbi Tavi said in the name of Rabbi Yoshiya: Anyone who is lax in his</b> study of <b>matters of Torah will</b> ultimately <b>lack the strength to stand on a day of adversity, as it is stated: “If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed”</b> (Proverbs 24:10). <b>Rav Ami bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: And even</b> if he was lax in the performance of <b>a single</b> mitzva, <b>as it is stated: If you faint;</b> this applies <b>in any case,</b> even in the case of a single mitzva. |
| Proverbs 24:17 | said to him: Is it not written for you: “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls” | Megillah 16a:10 | <b>After</b> Haman <b>trimmed his hair,</b> Haman <b>dressed</b> Mordecai in <b>the</b> royal <b>garments.</b> Haman then <b>said to him: Mount</b> the horse <b>and ride.</b> Mordecai <b>said to him: I am unable, as my strength has waned from the days of fasting</b> that I observed. Haman then <b>stooped down</b> before him <b>and</b> Mordecai <b>ascended</b> on him. <b>As he was ascending</b> the horse, Mordecai <b>gave</b> Haman <b>a kick.</b> Haman <b>said to him: Is it not written for you: “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls”</b> (Proverbs 24:17)? Mordecai <b>said to him: This</b> statement <b>applies</b> only to <b>Jews, but with regard to you it is written: “And you shall tread upon their high places”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:29). |
| Proverbs 24:21 | “My son, fear the Lord and the king; and meddle not with those who are repeating” | Sotah 22a:6 | The verse states: <b>“My son, fear the Lord and the king; and meddle not with those who are repeating”</b> (Proverbs 24:21). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: These are</b> individuals <b>who repeatedly learn</b> the <b><i>halakhot</i></b> but do not know the reasons behind them. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> How else could the verse be understood? The Gemara answers: He states this <b>lest you say</b> that the verse is referring to individuals who <b>repeatedly</b> commit <b>sins, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the words of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: Once a person committed a transgression and repeated it,</b> in his eyes <b>it became permitted for him.</b> Since the verse could be interpreted in this manner, Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>teaches us</b> that the verse is referring to those who learn without understanding. |
| Proverbs 24:24 | And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him, even fetuses in their mothers’ wombs curse him, as it is stated: “He who says to the wicked: You are righteous, peoples shall curse him [ yikkevuhu ], nations [ leummim ] shall execrate him” | Sotah 41b:13 | <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person who has flattery in him, even fetuses in their mothers’ wombs curse him, as it is stated: “He who says to the wicked: You are righteous, peoples shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>], nations [<i>leummim</i>] shall execrate him”</b> (Proverbs 24:24); <b>and <i>kov</i>,</b> the linguistic root of the word <i>yikkevuhu</i>, means <b>only a curse, as it is stated:</b> Balaam explained that he did not curse the Jewish people, as he said: “How can I curse [<i>ekkov</i>] <b>whom God has not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>]?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>le’om</i></b> is homiletically interpreted to mean <b>only fetuses, as it is stated</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau, when they were still in Rebecca’s womb: <b>“And one people [<i>le’om</i>] shall be stronger than the other people [<i>le’om</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:23). |
| Proverbs 24:25 | in the world, pleasantness comes into the world, goodness and blessing come into the world, and evil departs from the world, as it is stated: “But to those who admonish shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them” | Tamid 28a:3 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Which</b> way of life <b>is an upright path that a person should select for himself;</b> what should be his guiding principle? One <b>should love admonition, for as long as</b> statements of <b>admonition</b> from the wise are heard <b>in the world, pleasantness comes into the world, goodness and blessing come into the world, and evil departs from the world, as it is stated: “But to those who admonish shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them”</b> (Proverbs 24:25). <b>And some say:</b> The path one <b>should</b> select is to <b>adhere to utmost faithfulness</b> in business and interpersonal relations, <b>as it is stated: “My eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me;</b> he who walks in a way of integrity, he shall serve Me” (Psalms 101:6). |
| Proverbs 24:26 | before Rabbi Yosei, he recited this verse about him: “He kisses the lips that give the right answer” | Gittin 9a:2 | The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Even though Rabbi Yosei praised</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> with regard to this issue, <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> in that mishna. The Gemara elaborates how Rabbi Yosei bestowed praise. <b>As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:13): <b>When</b> these <b>matters were said</b> by the Sages <b>before Rabbi Yosei, he recited this verse about him: “He kisses the lips that give the right answer”</b> (Proverbs 24:26). Despite this praise, the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. |
| Proverbs 24:27 | Solomon said in his wisdom: “Prepare your work outside, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterward build your house” | Sotah 44a:6 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:20-21): The Torah states: “What man is there <b>that has built”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:5), and then <b>“that has planted”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6), and finally <b>“that has betrothed”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). <b>The Torah</b> has <b>taught</b> a person <b>the desired mode of behavior: A person should build a house,</b> then <b>plant a vineyard, and afterward marry a woman. And even</b> King <b>Solomon said in his wisdom: “Prepare your work outside, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterward build your house”</b> (Proverbs 24:27). The Sages explained: <b>“Prepare your work outside”; this</b> is <b>a house. “And make it fit for yourself in the field”; this</b> is <b>a vineyard. “And afterward you shall build your house”; this</b> is <b>a wife.</b> |
| Proverbs 25:1 | “These too are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judea, copied” | Sanhedrin 101b:1 | <b>“These too are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judea, copied”</b> (Proverbs 25:1), indicating that Hezekiah taught Torah and disseminated it to the multitudes. <b>And</b> is it conceivable that <b>Hezekiah, king of Judea, taught Torah to the entire world and to Manasseh his son he did not teach Torah? Rather,</b> Hezekiah certainly taught Manasseh much Torah; nevertheless, <b>from all his exertion to</b> teach <b>him and from all his toil to</b> teach <b>him,</b> it was <b>only afflictions</b> that <b>elevated him to</b> the path of <b>good, as it is stated: “And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people but they would not heed. And the Lord brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, and bound him with chains, and carried him to Babylonia”</b> (II Chronicles 33:10–11). |
| Proverbs 25:2 | “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter” | Shabbat 153b:4 | The Gemara asks: If <b>there is neither a gentile nor a donkey nor a deaf-mute nor an imbecile nor a minor there, what</b> should one do? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was another manner</b> of dealing with this situation, <b>and the Sages did not want to reveal it.</b> The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> was Rabbi Yitzḥak referring when he said: <b>There was another manner?</b> The Gemara answers: The alternative is to <b>move</b> the pouch in increments, <b>each less than four cubits,</b> and thereby carry the object in the public domain without violating a Torah prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>Why didn’t the Sages want to reveal this</b> alternative? The Gemara answers that it is <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter”</b> (Proverbs 25:2). <b>And here, what glory of God is there</b> in concealing this option? The Gemara answers: If one were to move the pouch in this manner, there is concern <b>lest</b> he <b>come to carry</b> the object <b>four cubits in the public domain.</b> |
| Proverbs 25:3 | “The Heavens on High and the land to the depth and the heart of kings are unsearchable” | Shabbat 11a:5 | <b>And Rava bar Meḥasseya said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Even <b>if all the seas would be ink, and</b> the reeds that grow near <b>swamps</b> would be <b>quills, and</b> the <b>heavens</b> would be <b>parchment</b> upon which the words would be written, <b>and all the people</b> would be <b>scribes;</b> all of these <b>are insufficient to write the</b> unquantifiable <b>space of</b> governmental <b>authority,</b> i.e., all the considerations with which a government must concern itself and deal. <b>Rav Mesharshiya said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“The Heavens on High and the land to the depth and the heart of kings are unsearchable”</b> (Proverbs 25:3). |
| Proverbs 25:14 | “As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts himself of a false gift” | Sanhedrin 29a:19 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the judges intimidate the witnesses. The Gemara asks: <b>What do we say to them? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>we say to them:</b> It is stated: <b>“As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts himself of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14). In other words, there will be no rain and no blessing from your deeds if you lie. |
| Proverbs 25:14 | as it is stated: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he who boasts of a false gift” | Taanit 8b:16 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is great, as even armies stop fighting on it</b> due to the rain and mud. <b>As it is stated: “Watering its ridges abundantly; settling down its furrows [<i>gedudeha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 65:11). As the word <i>gedudim</i> can mean both furrows or armies and is spelled identically with each meaning, this alludes to the idea that during the rainy season soldiers become entrenched in place. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: Rain is withheld only due to those who pledge charity in public but do not give</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he who boasts of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14). |
| Proverbs 25:14 | As it is written: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he that boasts himself of a false gift” | Yevamot 78b:16 | In the <b>third</b> year <b>he said to them: Perhaps there are among you those who pledge</b> money <b>to charity in public, but do not</b> actually <b>give</b> any charity. <b>As it is written: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he that boasts himself of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14), teaching that one who falsely boasts of making a gift prevents the rain from falling. Once again <b>they examined</b> the matter, <b>but could not find</b> such sinners. |
| Proverbs 25:14 | As it states: “As clouds [ nesi’im ] and wind without rain | Yoma 75a:19 | § With regard to donations for the Tabernacle, the verse states: <b>“And they brought yet to him free-will offerings every morning”</b> (Exodus 36:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“every morning”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said:</b> They brought donations <b>from that which fell every morning</b> with the manna. <b>This teaches that pearls and precious stones fell for the Israelites with the manna.</b> It states: <b>“And the rulers [<i>nesi’im</i>] brought the onyx [<i>shoham</i>] stones”</b> (Exodus 35:27). A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that the word <b><i>nesi’im</i></b> means <b>actual</b> clouds brought them. <b>As it states: “As clouds [<i>nesi’im</i>] and wind without rain</b> so is he that boasts himself of a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14). We learn from this that the precious stones fell from the clouds with the manna. |
| Proverbs 25:15 | broke one of his bones. He said: This is as it is written: “Soft speech can break a bone” | Gittin 68b:1 | and <b>she begged him</b> not to knock down the house. <b>He bent</b> his body away <b>from her,</b> to the other side, and <b>broke one of his bones. He said: This is as it is written: “Soft speech can break a bone”</b> (Proverbs 25:15). |
| Proverbs 25:16 | And with regard to him the verse states: “Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you become full from it and vomit it” | Chagigah 14b:9 | The Gemara proceeds to relate what happened to each of them: <b>Ben Azzai glimpsed</b> at the Divine Presence <b>and died. And with regard to him the verse states: “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His pious ones”</b> (Psalms 116:15). <b>Ben Zoma glimpsed</b> at the Divine Presence <b>and was harmed,</b> i.e., he lost his mind. <b>And with regard to him the verse states: “Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you become full from it and vomit it”</b> (Proverbs 25:16). <b><i>Aḥer</i> chopped down the shoots</b> of saplings. In other words, he became a heretic. <b>Rabbi Akiva came out safely.</b> |
| Proverbs 25:17 | “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, | Chagigah 7a:14 | Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish: <b>“Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,</b> lest he be sated with you, and hate you” (Proverbs 25:17). It can be inferred from this verse that one should not bring extra gifts, i.e., offerings, to God. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring <b>to sin</b>-offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings, i.e., it is better not to sin in the first place. |
| Proverbs 25:18 | to them: “As a hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, so is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor” | Sanhedrin 29a:21 | <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>we say</b> this verse <b>to them: “As a hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, so is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor”</b> (Proverbs 25:18), meaning that a false witness will die prematurely. |
| Proverbs 25:20 | to Rav Safra in a dream: “As one that takes off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon niter, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart” | Chullin 133a:11 | The attendant <b>granted</b> the gifts <b>to him; Rava ate</b> from them <b>but Rav Safra did not eat.</b> Following this incident, <b>they read</b> the following verse <b>to Rav Safra in a dream: “As one that takes off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon niter, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart”</b> (Proverbs 25:20). The verse can be interpreted allegorically as a chastisement of one who studies Torah but fails to understand it. |
| Proverbs 25:21 | her father’s house, as it is stated: “If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat” | Megillah 15b:13 | <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: She learned</b> to do <b>this from</b> the Jewish teachings of <b>her father’s house, as it is stated: “If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat”</b> (Proverbs 25:21). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> She invited him <b>in order</b> that he be near her at all times, <b>so that he would not take counsel and rebel</b> against Ahasuerus when he discovered that the king was angry with him. |
| Proverbs 25:23 | who speak slander, as it is stated: “The north wind brings forth rain, but a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance” | Taanit 7b:7 | <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of those <b>who speak slander, as it is stated: “The north wind brings forth rain, but a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance”</b> (Proverbs 25:23). This verse indicates that if the countenance of the heavens is angry, with neither clouds nor rain, it is due to slanderous speech. |
| Proverbs 25:25 | from here: “As cold water on a weary soul, | Yoma 77a:10 | <b>Rather,</b> another source needs to be found. <b>Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> It can be derived <b>from here: “As cold water on a weary soul,</b> so is good news from a far country” (Proverbs 25:25). This implies that the word weary is used to describe someone who has not bathed. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to weariness <b>from</b> not <b>drinking?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: As cold water in a weary soul?</b> That would mean that it entered one like a drink. Rather, <b>“on a weary soul” is written,</b> which implies bathing. |
| Proverbs 26:2 | die? But isn’t it written: “As the wandering sparrow, as the flying swallow, so a curse that is baseless shall come home” | Makkot 11a:14 | § The mishna teaches: <b>Therefore, the mothers of</b> High <b>Priests</b> would provide those exiled to cities of refuge with sustenance and garments so that they would not pray that their sons will die. The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> that the High Priest will not die <b>is that they do not pray; but if they prayed</b> for the death of the High Priest, would he <b>die? But isn’t it written: “As the wandering sparrow, as the flying swallow, so a curse that is baseless shall come home”</b> (Proverbs 26:2)? Why does the mishna express concern over a baseless curse? <b>A certain elder said to him: I heard in the lecture</b> delivered <b>by Rava</b> that it is not a baseless curse, as the High Priests share the blame for the unintentional murders performed by these people, <b>as they should have pleaded for mercy for their generation,</b> that no murder should transpire, even unintentionally, <b>and they did not plead.</b> Due to their share in the blame, prayers for their death could be effective. |
| Proverbs 26:4 | it is written: “Answer not a fool according to his folly, | Bava Metzia84a:5 | The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they respond to her</b> audacious and foolish question? After all, <b>it is written: “Answer not a fool according to his folly,</b> lest you also be like him” (Proverbs 26:4). The Gemara answers: They answered her <b>in order not to cast aspersions on</b> the lineage of <b>their children.</b> |
| Proverbs 26:4 | it is written: “Answer not a fool according to his folly, | Shabbat 30b:7 | <b>And,</b> the Gemara continues, the Sages <b>sought to suppress the book of Proverbs as well</b> because <b>its statements contradict each other. And why did they not suppress it? They said:</b> In the case of <b>the book of Ecclesiastes, didn’t we analyze it and find an explanation</b> that its statements were not contradictory? <b>Here too, let us analyze it. And what is</b> the meaning of: <b>Its statements contradict each other?</b> On the one hand, <b>it is written: “Answer not a fool according to his folly,</b> lest you also be like him” (Proverbs 26:4), <b>and</b> on the other hand, <b>it is written: “Answer a fool according to his folly,</b> lest he be wise in his own eyes” (Proverbs 26:5). The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> where one should answer a fool, is referring to a case where the fool is making claims <b>about Torah matters;</b> whereas <b>that,</b> where one should not answer him, is referring to a case where the fool is making claims <b>about mundane matters.</b> |
| Proverbs 26:5 | it is written: “Answer a fool according to his folly, | Shabbat 30b:7 | <b>And,</b> the Gemara continues, the Sages <b>sought to suppress the book of Proverbs as well</b> because <b>its statements contradict each other. And why did they not suppress it?

The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> where one should answer a fool, is referring to a case where the fool is making claims <b>about Torah matters;</b> whereas <b>that,</b> where one should not answer him, is referring to a case where the fool is making claims <b>about mundane matters.</b> |
| Proverbs 26:8 | like one who throws a stone to Markulis, as it is stated: “As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that gives honor to a fool” | Chullin 133a:16 | On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who teaches</b> Torah <b>to an unworthy student</b> is considered <b>like one who throws a stone to Markulis, as it is stated: “As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that gives honor to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 26:8), <b>and it is written: “Luxury is not seemly for a fool”</b> (Proverbs 19:10). |
| Proverbs 26:11 | on another Yom Kippur. And if he did not repeat them but did confess them again, about him the verse states: “As a dog that returns to its vomit, so is a fool who repeats his folly” | Yoma 86b:12 | § <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>transgressions that one confessed on this Yom Kippur, he should not confess them on another Yom Kippur,</b> since he has already been forgiven. <b>But if he repeated those</b> same transgressions during the year, <b>he must confess</b> them again <b>on another Yom Kippur. And if he did not repeat them but did confess them again, about him the verse states: “As a dog that returns to its vomit, so is a fool who repeats his folly”</b> (Proverbs 26:11), since it is inappropriate to go back and mention one’s earlier sins. |
| Proverbs 26:26 | the Omnipresent revealed it in the open, as it is stated: “Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation” | Sotah 9a:4 | <b>Alternatively, she acted in secret,</b> and therefore <b>the Omnipresent revealed it in the open, as it is stated: “Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation”</b> (Proverbs 26:26), i.e., concealed acts of sin are ultimately revealed in public. |
| Proverbs 27:2 | “But I, your servant, have feared the Lord from my youth.” And it is written: “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth” | Nedarim 62a:11 | <b>Rava raises a contradiction: It is written</b> that Obadiah spoke highly of himself: <b>“But I, your servant, have feared the Lord from my youth.” And it is written: “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth”</b> (Proverbs 27:2). He answers: <b>This</b> verse is referring <b>to a place where</b> people <b>know him,</b> where he should not praise himself, whereas <b>that</b> verse is referring <b>to a place where</b> people <b>do not know him.</b> |
| Proverbs 27:2 | praise himself? But isn’t it written: “Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth, | Sanhedrin 42a:18 | <b>Some say</b> they raised an objection to the second explanation: <b>Granted, if you say</b> this means: <b>The judgment</b> has <b>aged, this</b> would be the reason that the greatest one states it, <b>because being shamed by oneself is not comparable to being shamed by others.

| Proverbs 27:6 | which is written: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are importunate” | Sanhedrin 105b:20 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are importunate”</b> (Proverbs 27:6)? <b>Better is the curse that Ahijah the Shilonite cursed the Jewish people than the blessing that Balaam the wicked blessed them. Ahijah the Shilonite cursed Israel with a reed, as it is stated: “For the Lord shall smite Israel as a reed is shaken in water”</b> (I Kings 14:15). There is an aspect of blessing in that curse, as he was saying they will be <b>just like a reed</b> that <b>stands in a place</b> near <b>water,</b> as the water sustains it, <b>and its stalk</b> |
| Proverbs 27:6 | which is written: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful” | Taanit 20a:13 | The prophet Ahijah the Shilonite cursed Israel in the following terms: <b>“For the Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water”</b> (I Kings 14:15). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This too is <b>for a blessing, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful”</b> (Proverbs 27:6)? <b>The curse with which Ahijah the Shilonite cursed the Jewish people is more</b> effective <b>than the blessing with which Balaam the wicked blessed them.</b> |
| Proverbs 27:7 | as it is written: “The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet” | Bava Kamma92b:11 | <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: A dog, in its hunger, swallows</b> even <b>dung?</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet”</b> (Proverbs 27:7). |
| Proverbs 27:8 | “As a bird that wanders from her nest, | Berakhot 56b:9 | Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3). |
| Proverbs 27:8 | Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said: Any Torah scholar who leaves the Torah, about him the verse says: “As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place” | Chagigah 9b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said: Any Torah scholar who leaves the Torah, about him the verse says: “As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place”</b> (Proverbs 27:8). <b>And it says: “What unrighteousness have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from Me?”</b> (Jeremiah 2:5). This indicates that the punishment is greater for one who was close to God and became distant from Him. In any case, there is a contradiction here, as in the mishna Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says that the act of one who fathers an illegitimate child is crooked and cannot be straightened, whereas in the <i>baraita</i> he says the same applies to anyone who has forbidden sexual relations, regardless of whether or not he fathers a child. |
| Proverbs 27:10 | “Better a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far” | Bava Metzia108b:9 | If one is a regular <b>neighbor and</b> the other is <b>a Torah scholar, the Torah scholar</b> receives <b>precedence.</b> If one is <b>a relative and</b> the other is <b>a Torah scholar,</b> here too, <b>the Torah scholar</b> receives <b>precedence. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a neighbor and a relative, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Which of them takes precedence? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from the following verse: <b>“Better a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far”</b> (Proverbs 27:10). |
| Proverbs 27:10 | “A close neighbor is better than a distant brother” | Ketubot 85b:8 | <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If two men have the same name and one was <b>a neighbor and</b> the other one was <b>a relative, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the solution from the following verse: <b>“A close neighbor is better than a distant brother”</b> (Proverbs 27:10). If <b>they</b> were <b>both relatives, or both neighbors, or both scholars,</b> there is no systematic way of determining who is entitled to the property, and the decision is left to <b>the discretion of the judges.</b> |
| Proverbs 27:11 | “Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me” | Berakhot 4a:13 | <b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 27:11 | “My son, be wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond to he who taunts Me” | Eruvin 21b:16 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that</b> King <b>Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards <b>and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, which are added safeguards to the words of the Torah, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will be glad, even Mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15). <b>And it states</b> with regard to him: <b>“My son, be wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond to he who taunts Me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11). |
| Proverbs 27:14 | which is written: “He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him” | Arakhin 16a:2 | The Gemara continues its discussion of good and bad speech. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him”</b> (Proverbs 27:14)? <b>For example, when</b> one <b>is invited to a host, and they look after him very well.

And</b> all the <b>people</b> in the marketplace <b>hear and go</b> to this host <b>and afflict him</b> by expecting him to look after all of them in the same way, and he is compelled to spend his money on them. It turns out that the praise and blessing the guest lavished upon his host brought a curse upon him. |
| Proverbs 27:15 | with her peer and not with a thorn. And Rava said: A bad wife is as troublesome as a day of heavy rain, as it is stated: “A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike” | Yevamot 63b:5 | <b>Rava said: It is a mitzva to divorce a bad wife, as it is written: “Cast out the scorner and contention will depart; strife and shame will cease”</b> (Proverbs 22:10). <b>And Rava said: A bad wife whose marriage contract</b> settlement <b>is</b> too <b>large</b> for her husband to pay in the event of a divorce, <b>her rival wife is at her side.</b> In other words, the only way for him to improve matters is to take another wife. <b>As people say</b> in the well-known adage: The way to trouble a woman is <b>with her peer and not with a thorn. And Rava said: A bad wife is as troublesome as a day of heavy rain, as it is stated: “A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike”</b> (Proverbs 27:15). |
| Proverbs 27:17 | which is written: “Iron sharpens iron, | Taanit 7a:8 | The Gemara cites other expositions that deal with Torah study. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Iron sharpens iron,</b> so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend” (Proverbs 27:17)? This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with <b>these iron implements, one sharpens the other</b> when they are rubbed against each other, <b>so too,</b> when <b>Torah scholars</b> study together, they <b>sharpen one another in <i>halakha</i>.</b> |
| Proverbs 27:18 | his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof” | Berakhot 57a:7 | <b>One who sees a fig tree in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his Torah is preserved within him, as it is stated: “One who keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof”</b> (Proverbs 27:18). <b>One who sees pomegranates in a dream,</b> if they were <b>small, his business will flourish like the seeds of</b> the <b>pomegranate,</b> which are numerous; and if they were <b>large, his business will increase like a pomegranate.</b> One who saw <b>slices of pomegranates</b> in his dream, <b>if he is a Torah scholar, he should anticipate Torah, as it is stated: “I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 8:2), which is traditionally understood as an allusion to Torah. <b>And if</b> the dreamer <b>is an ignoramus, he should anticipate mitzvot,</b> as it is stated: <b>“Your temples are like a split pomegranate”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3). As the Gemara previously interpreted homiletically: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>“Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>]”?

| Proverbs 27:18 | that which is written: “He who guards the fig tree shall eat its fruit” | Eruvin 54a:27 | <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “He who guards the fig tree shall eat its fruit”</b> (Proverbs 27:18)? <b>Why were matters of Torah compared to a fig tree?

| Proverbs 27:19 | “As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man” | Yevamot 117a:17 | <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that the reasons for the hatred are the same and therefore count only five disqualified women, how do they respond to this argument? They cite the verse: <b>“As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man”</b> (Proverbs 27:19). That is, if one person hates another, the feeling soon becomes mutual. Here too, there is no need for a separate reason in order that the hatred be reciprocated. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> why doesn’t he rely on this verse? Rabbi Yehuda would retort: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written about matters of Torah.</b> In other words, it means that the more one studies Torah, the more Torah he understands. |
| Proverbs 27:20 | as it is written: “The netherworld and destruction are never satiated; | Tamid 32b:4 | <b>He said to the Sages: What is this?</b> Why does this eyeball outweigh everything? <b>They said: It is the eyeball</b> of a mortal person <b>of flesh and blood, which is not satisfied</b> ever. <b>He said to them: From where</b> do you know <b>that this is</b> the reason for the unbalanced scale? The Sages answered him: <b>Take a small amount of dirt and cover</b> the eye. He did so, and it was <b>immediately balanced</b> by its proper counterweight. The eye is never satisfied while it can see, <b>as it is written: “The netherworld and destruction are never satiated;</b> so the eyes of man are never satiated” (Proverbs 27:20). |
| Proverbs 27:22 | “Though you should bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [ harifot ]” | Keritot 11a:8 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Actually, he is liable only</b> in a case where he engages in intercourse with <b>a non-virgin maidservant, as it is stated: “And she is a maidservant designated [<i>neḥerefet</i>] for a man.” And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“designated [<i>neḥerefet</i>],” is a term of change,</b> i.e., that she has already changed from her status as a virgin to that of a non-virgin? Rabbi Yitzḥak explains: <b>As it is written: “And strewed groats [<i>harifot</i>] thereon”</b> (II Samuel 17:19). Since groats are grains that have been crushed or otherwise changed from their original form, the linguistic correlation between <i>harifot</i> and <i>neḥerefet</i> indicates that both terms are referring to some form of change. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“Though you should bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [<i>harifot</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 27:22). |
| Proverbs 27:22 | say from here: “Though you should crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [ harifot ], | Sotah 42b:7 | <b>It is written</b> that Goliath’s mother was: <b>“Harafa”</b> (II Samuel 21:16), <b>and</b> in another place <b>it is written: “Orpah”</b> (Ruth 1:4), and the Gemara will soon explain that this was the same woman. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> engaged in a dispute concerning this matter. <b>One</b> of them <b>said: Her name was Harafa, and why is she called</b> by the <b>name Orpah?</b> It is <b>because everyone came at her from behind [<i>orfin</i>] her,</b> i.e., sodomized her. <b>And one</b> of them <b>said: Her name was Orpah, and why is she called</b> by the <b>name Harafa?</b> It is <b>because everyone threshed her like groats [<i>harifot</i>],</b> i.e., engaged in sexual intercourse with her, <b>and so it says</b> that this word means groats: <b>“And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed groats [<i>harifot</i>] thereon”</b> (II Samuel 17:19). <b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say from here: “Though you should crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [<i>harifot</i>],</b> yet will not his foolishness depart from him” (Proverbs 27:22). |
| Proverbs 27:24 | “For power is not forever, and does the crown endure for all generations?” | Sanhedrin 7b:11 | In a similar demonstration of humility, <b>when</b> Rav <b>would see a convoy [<i>ambuha</i>] of scribes</b> following <b>after him</b> to honor him, he <b>would say: “Though his excellency mount up to the heavens</b> and his head reach the clouds, <b>yet he shall perish forever like his own dung;</b> they who have seen him shall say: Where is he?” (Job 20:6–7). It is said of <b>Mar Zutra the Pious</b> that <b>when</b> the people <b>would carry him</b> to his lectures <b>on their shoulders during Shabbat of the Festival,</b> he would <b>say this</b> to avoid becoming arrogant: <b>“For power is not forever, and does the crown endure for all generations?”</b> (Proverbs 27:24). |
| Proverbs 27:24 | “For power is not forever, and does the crown endure for all generations?” | Yoma 87a:1 | <b>Of his own will, he goes to die; and he does not fulfill the will of his household, and he goes empty-handed to his household; and if only his entrance would be like his exit. And when he saw a line of people [<i>ambuha</i>]</b> following <b>after him</b> out of respect for him, <b>he said: “Though his excellency ascends to the heavens, and his head reaches to the clouds, yet he shall perish forever like his own dung; they who have seen him will say: Where is he?”</b> (Job 20:6–7). This teaches that when one achieves power, it can lead to his downfall. <b>When they would carry Rav Zutra on their shoulders during the Shabbat of the Festival</b> when he taught, <b>he would recite</b> the following to avoid becoming arrogant: <b>“For power is not forever, and does the crown endure for all generations?”</b> (Proverbs 27:24). |
| Proverbs 27:26 | will be for your clothing” | Chagigah 13a:9 | <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> It is derived from <b>here,</b> from the following verse: <b>“The lambs</b> [<b><i>kevasim</i></b>] <b>will be for your clothing”</b> (Proverbs 27:26), which he expounds as though it were written with the letter <i>shin</i>, <i>kevashim</i>, meaning concealed matters: <b>Things that constitute the concealed matters of the world should be under your clothing;</b> you should not reveal them. When the Elders of Pumbedita saw that Rav Yosef was not going to teach them, <b>they said to him: We have learned them,</b> the verses concerning the Design of the Divine Chariot written in the book of Ezekiel, <b>up to</b> the verse <b>“And He said to me, son of man”</b> (Ezekiel 2:1). <b>He said to them:</b> If so, <b>these</b> verses <b>are</b> the very essence of the <b>Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot,</b> as they provide the main details of the topic. |
| Proverbs 27:27 | that it is written: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, and maintenance for your maidens” | Bekhorot 6b:15 | <b>Rather,</b> proof may be brought that milk is permitted <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, and maintenance for your maidens”</b> (Proverbs 27:27). According to the verse, goats’ milk serves as food, and therefore must be kosher. |
| Proverbs 27:27 | goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, | Berakhot 57a:9 | <b>Rav Yosef says: One who sees a goat in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his year will be blessed;</b> one who sees <b>goats, his years will be blessed, as it is stated: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,</b> for the food of your household; and sustenance for your maidens” (Proverbs 27:27). <b>One who sees myrtle in a dream,</b> it is a sign that <b>his property will be successful.

Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: This</b> applies exclusively to a case <b>where he saw</b> them <b>on their stem.

| Proverbs 28:4 | as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, and the keepers of the Torah will fight them” | Berakhot 7b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world.</b> Though the ways of the wicked prosper, one is still permitted to provoke them and need not fear (Maharsha), <b>as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, and the keepers of the Torah will fight them”</b> (Proverbs 28:4). |
| Proverbs 28:4 | Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “They that forsake the Torah praise the wicked; but they who keep the Torah contend with them” | Megillah 6b:6 | The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “They that forsake the Torah praise the wicked; but they who keep the Torah contend with them”</b> (Proverbs 28:4)? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Dostai bar Matun said: It is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, and if a person whispers to you to say</b> that this is not so, relying on the verse: <b>“Contend not with evildoers, nor be envious against the workers of iniquity” (</b>Psalms 37:1), know that only <b>one whose heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he committed <b>says this.</b> |
| Proverbs 28:8 | “He who augments his substance by interest [ beneshekh ] and increase [ vetarbit ] gathers it for him who has pity on the poor” | Bava Metzia70b:9 | § Apropos the discussion concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of interest, the Gemara cites several aggadic statements on the subject. The verse states: <b>“He who augments his substance by interest [<i>beneshekh</i>] and increase [<i>vetarbit</i>] gathers it for him who has pity on the poor”</b> (Proverbs 28:8). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“him who has pity on the poor”?</b> How does this money ultimately reach someone who has pity on the poor? <b>Rav said:</b> This is referring to one <b>such as King Shapur,</b> for ultimately the money will reach the king, who provides for the poor from the possessions of the one who lends with interest. |
| Proverbs 28:9 | “One who turns his ear from hearing Torah, his prayer is also an abomination” | Shabbat 10a:3 | Speaking of prayer, the Gemara relates that <b>Rava saw Rav Hamnuna, who was prolonging his prayer. He said</b> about him: <b>They abandon eternal life,</b> the study of Torah, <b>and engage in temporal life,</b> prayer, which includes requests for mundane needs. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>held that the time</b> for <b>prayer is distinct and the time</b> for <b>Torah is distinct.</b> The time that one devotes to prayer is not at the expense of the time devoted to Torah study. Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira and they were engaged in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i>. The time for prayer</b> was approaching and <b>it was getting late and Rabbi Yirmeya was hurrying</b> to conclude the subject that they were studying in order to pray. <b>Rabbi Zeira read</b> this verse as applying <b>to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>“One who turns his ear from hearing Torah, his prayer is also an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 28:9). |
| Proverbs 28:13 | but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall obtain mercy” | Taanit 16a:15 | <b>As it is stated:</b> “He who covers his transgressions shall not prosper, <b>but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall obtain mercy”</b> (Proverbs 28:13). That is, confession alone is futile, but one who also abandons his transgressions will receive mercy. <b>And it states</b> elsewhere: <b>“Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in Heaven”</b> (Lamentations 3:41), which likewise indicates that it is not enough to lift one’s hands in prayer; rather, one must also raise his heart and return to God. |
| Proverbs 28:13 | and it is written: “He who hides his transgressions shall not prosper” | Yoma 86b:9 | <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav raised a contradiction: It is written: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden”</b> (Psalms 32:1), implying that it is inappropriate for one to reveal his sins, <b>and it is written: “He who hides his transgressions shall not prosper”</b> (Proverbs 28:13). He resolved the contradiction as follows: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring to <b>a publicized sin;</b> since his sin is public knowledge it is fitting for him to also publicize his repentance. <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to a sin that is not publicized,</b> in which case it is inappropriate to publicize one’s repentance. <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviya</b> said that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Here,</b> it is referring <b>to sins a person commits against another;</b> he must publicize his repentance so that those who hear him may persuade the other to forgive him. <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to sins a person commits against God,</b> in which case he need not repent publicly. |
| Proverbs 28:14 | replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always” | Berakhot 60a:17 | The Gemara relates: <b>This student was once walking after Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, in the marketplace of Zion.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saw that</b> the student <b>was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid,</b> trembling has seized the ungodly” (Isaiah 33:14). The student <b>replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> that one should be afraid lest he forget them. For everything else, one must trust in God. |
| Proverbs 28:14 | which is written: “Happy is the man who fears always, but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief” | Gittin 55b:16 | § Apropos the war that led to the destruction of the Second Temple, the Gemara examines several aspects of the destruction of that Temple in greater detail: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy is the man who fears always, but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? <b>Jerusalem was destroyed on account of Kamtza and bar Kamtza.</b> The place known as <b>the King’s Mountain was destroyed on account of a rooster and a hen.</b> The city of <b>Beitar was destroyed on account of a shaft from a chariot [<i>rispak</i>].</b> |
| Proverbs 28:15 | Reish Lakish introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear, so is a wicked ruler over a poor people” | Megillah 11a:4 | <b>Reish Lakish introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear, so is a wicked ruler over a poor people”</b> (Proverbs 28:15). <b>“A roaring lion”; this is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written about him: “The lion has come up from his thicket”</b> (Jeremiah 4:7). <b>“A hungry bear”; this is Ahasuerus, as it is written about him: “And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>And Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>these</b> who are referred to as a bear in the verse <b>are the Persians.</b> They are compared to a bear, <b>as they eat and drink</b> in large quantities <b>like a bear; and they are coated with flesh like a bear; and they grow their hair</b> long <b>like a bear; and they never rest like a bear,</b> whose manner it is to move about from place to place. |
| Proverbs 28:17 | he will not be in the Garden of Eden while his students are in Gehenna, as it is stated: “A man who is laden with the blood of any person shall hasten his steps to the pit; none will support him” | Yoma 87a:6 | Furthermore: <b>Whoever</b> accumulates <b>merit for the public will not have sin come to his hand,</b> and God protects him from failing; <b>but whoever causes the public to sin has almost no ability to repent.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>whoever</b> accumulates <b>merit for the public will not have sin come to his hand?</b> It is <b>so that he will not be in Gehenna while his students are in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For You will not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither will You suffer Your godly one to see the pit”</b> (Psalms 16:10). On the other hand, <b>whoever causes the public to sin has almost no ability to repent,</b> so that <b>he will not be in the Garden of Eden while his students are in Gehenna, as it is stated: “A man who is laden with the blood of any person shall hasten his steps to the pit; none will support him”</b> (Proverbs 28:17). Since he oppressed others and caused them to sin, he shall have no escape. |
| Proverbs 28:23 | the portion of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “He that rebukes a man shall be behind Me” | Tamid 28a:4 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who rebukes another for the sake of Heaven is privileged to</b> dwell in <b>the portion of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “He that rebukes a man shall be behind Me”</b> (Proverbs 28:23), i.e., with Me. <b>Moreover,</b> the heavenly court <b>extends over him a cord of</b> divine <b>grace, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“He will find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.”</b> |
| Proverbs 28:24 | Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer” | Berakhot 35b:2 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel. |
| Proverbs 28:24 | a blessing, it is as though he stole from the Holy One, Blessed be He, and the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a corrupter” | Sanhedrin 102a:11 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who derives benefit from this world without</b> reciting <b>a blessing, it is as though he stole from the Holy One, Blessed be He, and the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a corrupter”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his father”</b> is referring to <b>none other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you?” (Deuteronomy 32:6). <b>And</b> the term <b>“his mother”</b> is referring to <b>none other than the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mother indicates that the mother represents the congregation of Israel, and the Torah of the mother is the tradition of the Jewish people. |
| Proverbs 29:2 | Rava introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice; but when the wicked man rules, the people mourn” | Megillah 11a:8 | <b>Rava introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice; but when the wicked man rules, the people mourn”</b> (Proverbs 29:2). <b>“When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice”; this is Mordecai and Esther, as it is written: “And the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad”</b> (Esther 8:15). <b>“But when the wicked man rules, the people mourn”; this is Haman, as it is written: “But the city of Shushan was perplexed”</b> (Esther 3:15). |
| Proverbs 29:3 | wastes his fortune” | Eruvin 64a:8 | <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master said this,</b> making a statement that praises one <i>halakha</i> and disparages another? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But he who keeps company with prostitutes</b> [<b><i>zonot</i></b>] <b>wastes his fortune”</b> (Proverbs 29:3)? It alludes to the following: <b>Anyone who says: This teaching is pleasant</b> [<b><i>zo na’a</i></b>] <b>but this is not pleasant, loses the fortune of Torah.</b> It is not in keeping with the honor of Torah to make such evaluations. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I retract,</b> and I will no longer make such comments concerning words of Torah. |

As it is written: “But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his riches” | Sotah 36b:13 | The verse states: <b>“And she caught him by his garment, saying:</b> Lie with me” (Genesis 39:12). <b>At that moment his father’s image [<i>deyokeno</i>] came and appeared to him in the window.</b> The image <b>said to him: Joseph,</b> the names of <b>your brothers are destined to be written on the stones of the ephod, and you</b> are to be included <b>among them. Do you desire your name to be erased from among them, and to be called an associate [<i>ro’eh</i>] of promiscuous women? As it is written: “But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his riches”</b> (Proverbs 29:3), as he loses his honor, which is more valuable than wealth. |
| Proverbs 29:4 | which is written: “The king by justice establishes the land, but he who exacts gifts [ terumot ] overthrows it” | Ketubot 105b:2 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Kohen interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically</b> as follows. <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The king by justice establishes the land, but he who exacts gifts [<i>terumot</i>] overthrows it”</b> (Proverbs 29:4)? <b>If a judge is like a king,</b> in <b>that he does not need anything</b> and is not dependent on anyone, <b>he establishes the land,</b> i.e., he can serve as a judge. <b>But if he is like a priest, who seeks out</b> his <i>terumot</i> <b>from</b> various <b>granaries,</b> as he is dependent on others, <b>he overthrows</b> the land. |
| Proverbs 29:4 | as it is written: “The king by justice establishes the land” | Sanhedrin 14b:2 | § The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to the breaking of the neck of the heifer, the verse states: <b>“And your elders and your judges shall go out”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:2). <b>“Your elders,” this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanhedrin; “and your judges,” this</b> is referring to the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest.</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains the assertion that the <b>king</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written: “The king by justice establishes the land”</b> (Proverbs 29:4), and the <b>High Priest</b> is also called a judge, <b>as it is written: “And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge</b> that will be in those days” (Deuteronomy 17:9), referring to the High Priest. |
| Proverbs 29:4 | which is written: “The king by justice establishes the land; but he who exacts gifts [ terumot ] overthrows it” | Sanhedrin 7b:5 | <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he <b>said: Rav Naḥman bar Kohen interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The king by justice establishes the land; but he who exacts gifts [<i>terumot</i>] overthrows it”</b> (Proverbs 29:4)? This teaches that <b>if the judge</b> is <b>like a king</b> in <b>that he does not need anything</b> and is not dependent on anyone, he <b>establishes the land,</b> i.e., he can serve as a judge. <b>But if he is like a priest who seeks out</b> his <i>terumot</i> <b>from</b> various <b>granaries,</b> as he is dependent on others, he <b>overthrows</b> the land. |
| Proverbs 29:4 | as it is written: “A king by justice establishes the land” | Sotah 45a:3 | § The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: “Your Elders,” this is the Sanhedrin; “your judges,” this is the king and the High Priest.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, the king and the High Priest need to participate in the ritual of breaking the neck of the heifer. From where is it learned that they are called judges? <b>A king</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written: “A king by justice establishes the land”</b> (Proverbs 29:4). <b>A High Priest</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written:</b> “If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment…<b>And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be</b> in those days” (Deuteronomy 17:8–9). |
| Proverbs 29:7 | that which is written: “The righteous man takes knowledge of the cause of the poor” | Shabbat 155b:11 | Returning to the discussion of feeding dogs, the Gemara cites additional statements on the topic. <b>Rabbi Yona taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The righteous man takes knowledge of the cause of the poor”</b> (Proverbs 29:7)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, knows that for a dog, its sustenance is scarce</b> and they are not fed sufficiently. <b>Therefore, its food remains in its intestines for three days</b> so that the dog will be sustained by that food, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity: After an animal eats flesh from a corpse, <b>how long does its food remain in its intestines</b> undigested <b>and</b> therefore <b>ritually impure? In</b> the case of <b>a dog</b> it is for <b>three twenty-four hour periods, and for fowl and fish,</b> who digest their food quickly, it is <b>the equivalent</b> of <b>the</b> time it takes <b>for</b> the flesh <b>to fall into the fire and be consumed</b> by the fire. |
| Proverbs 29:9 | which is written: “If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he is angry or laughs, there is no rest” | Sanhedrin 103a:7 | <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he is angry or laughs, there is no rest”</b> (Proverbs 29:9)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I was angry with Ahaz and I delivered him into the hand of the kings of Damascus.

But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel”</b> (II Chronicles 28:23). When the Holy One, Blessed be He, was angry with Israel and caused them to lose a war to prompt them to repent of their sins, their response was to worship idols. |
| Proverbs 29:12 | not enter your mind, as it is written: “If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked” | Chullin 4b:16 | The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps,</b> although Ahab was an idolater, <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab were upstanding</b> people, not idolaters, and they slaughtered the animals. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked”</b> (Proverbs 29:12). |
| Proverbs 29:13 | “The poor man and the oppressor [ tekhakhim ] meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them” | Temurah 16a:17 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say</b> likewise with regard to the following verse: <b>“The poor man and the oppressor [<i>tekhakhim</i>] meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them”</b> (Proverbs 29:13). <b>When the student,</b> who is poor in his knowledge, <b>goes to his teacher,</b> i.e., one who knows enough to teach but requires further enlightenment himself, as he is a man between [<i>tokh</i>] the levels of a Sage and a commoner, <b>and says to him: Teach me Torah, if</b> the teacher agrees to <b>teach him,</b> then <b>the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them,</b> as they both become greater as a result. <b>But if</b> the teacher will <b>not</b> teach the student, then <b>“the rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all”</b> (Proverbs 22:2). This verse teaches that He <b>Who made this one wise</b> now <b>makes him foolish,</b> and He Who made <b>that one foolish</b> now <b>makes him wise. This is the exposition of Rabbi Natan.</b> |
| Proverbs 29:13 | “The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them” | Temurah 16a:19 | <b>On a similar</b> note, <b>you say</b> an interpretation with regard to the verse: <b>“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both of them”</b> (Proverbs 29:13). <b>When a poor</b> person <b>goes to a homeowner and says: Provide for me, if he provides for him,</b> that is <b>good. But if not,</b> then it is stated: <b>“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all”</b> (Proverbs 22:2). This verse indicates that He <b>Who made this one wealthy</b> now <b>makes him poor,</b> and He Who made <b>that one poor</b> now <b>makes him wealthy.</b> |
| Proverbs 29:17 | as it is written: “Chastise your son, and he will give you rest; and he will give delight to your soul” | Makkot 8a:14 | <b>Ravina raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from a clause of the mishna that states that the example of the forest serves <b>to exclude a father who strikes his son, and a teacher who oppresses his student, and an agent of the court. Let us say</b> with regard to a father who strikes his son: <b>Since if</b> the son was <b>learned,</b> it is <b>not a mitzva</b> to strike him, <b>now,</b> in a case where the son is not learned and the father strikes him to facilitate his education <b>too,</b> it is <b>not a mitzva,</b> and therefore he should be exiled. Rava replied: <b>There, even though</b> the son <b>is learned,</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> to strike him from time to time, <b>as it is written: “Chastise your son, and he will give you rest; and he will give delight to your soul”</b> (Proverbs 29:17). |
| Proverbs 29:17 | as it is written: “Chastise your son, and he will give you rest; and he will give delight to your soul” | Makkot 8b:6 | <b>Ravina raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from the clause of the mishna that states that the example of the forest serves <b>to exclude a father who strikes his son, and a teacher who oppresses his student, and an agent of the court.

| Proverbs 29:19 | “A servant will not be corrected by words” | Ketubot 77a:18 | <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as in <b>this</b> case the mishna discusses someone who is forced to divorce his wife <b>by verbal</b> means alone, but in <b>that</b> case it is referring to compelling him <b>by</b> beating him with <b>rods.</b> Although the court does compel a man to divorce his wife if she has not had children, the court does so only by speaking with him. <b>Rabbi Abba strongly objects to this:</b> Can there be a <i>halakha</i> of coercion by verbal means alone? But the verse states: <b>“A servant will not be corrected by words”</b> (Proverbs 29:19). <b>Rather, Rabbi Abba said:</b> Both <b>this and that</b> are referring to coercion <b>by</b> beating him with <b>rods,</b> |
| Proverbs 29:21 | testifies against him in the next world, as it is stated: “He that delicately brings up his servant from a child shall have him become a master [ manon ] at the last” | Sukkah 52b:3 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The evil inclination incites a person</b> to sin <b>in this world, and</b> then <b>testifies against him in the next world, as it is stated: “He that delicately brings up his servant from a child shall have him become a master [<i>manon</i>] at the last”</b> (Proverbs 29:21). Initially, in one’s youth, the evil inclination, which should have been enslaved to him, takes control of him and causes him to sin. Then, ultimately, that same evil inclination becomes his <i>manon</i>. <i>Manon</i> means witness, <b>as in Rabbi Ḥiyya’s</b> coded alphabet in which <b><i>alef</i></b> and <b><i>tet</i></b> and <b><i>beit</i></b> and <b><i>ḥet</i>,</b> etc., are interchanged. <b>Witness</b> [<b><i>sahada</i></b>] <b>is called <i>manon</i>.</b> The letters <i>mem</i> and <i>samekh</i>, <i>nun</i> and <i>heh</i>, and <i>vav</i> and <i>dalet</i> are interchanged with other letters. |
| Proverbs 29:22 | it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in transgression” | Nedarim 22b:2 | <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Anyone who gets angry,</b> at that moment <b>even the Divine Presence is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God”</b> (Psalms 10:4). <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> Anyone who gets angry <b>forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:9), <b>and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly”</b> (Proverbs 13:16). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to one who gets angry, <b>it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in transgression”</b> (Proverbs 29:22). |
| Proverbs 30:2 | As it is written: “For I am more foolish than a man, and have not the understanding of a man” | Sanhedrin 70b:6 | <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> can it be learned <b>that Solomon repented and admitted to his mother</b> that she was justified in her rebukes? <b>As it is written: “For I am more foolish than a man, and have not the understanding of a man”</b> (Proverbs 30:2). This should be understood as follows: <b>“For I am more foolish than a man [<i>ish</i>]”;</b> that is, I am more foolish than Noah, who sinned with wine and is called “a man,” <b>as it is written: “And Noah began to be a farmer [<i>ish ha’adama</i></b>]” (Genesis 9:20). <b>“And have not the understanding of a man [<i>adam</i>]”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Adam the first</b> man, who also sinned with wine, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who says that the Tree of Knowledge was a grapevine. |
| Proverbs 30:6 | And it says: “Add you not unto his words” | Megillah 7a:10 | <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The book of <b>Ecclesiastes does not render the hands ritually impure because it is the wisdom of Solomon,</b> and not divinely inspired. <b>They said to him:</b> It was certainly divinely inspired and that is the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes was added to the canon; <b>as was it this alone that</b> Solomon <b>said? Wasn’t it already stated: “And he spoke three thousand proverbs,</b> and his poems were a thousand and five” (I Kings 5:12)? Solomon spoke many proverbs, but only a portion of them were canonized in the Bible. Apparently, what is unique about those in Ecclesiastes is that they were divinely inspired. <b>And it says: “Add you not unto his words”</b> (Proverbs 30:6). |
| Proverbs 30:8 | from here: “Feed me with my allotted [ ḥukki ] bread” | Beitzah 16a:3 | The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b>“statute [<i>ḥok</i>]” is a term</b> relating <b>to food? As it is written: “And they ate their allotment [<i>ḥukkam</i>], which Pharaoh gave them”</b> (Genesis 47:22). <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> One can learn that <i>ḥok</i> is referring to food <b>from here: “Feed me with my allotted [<i>ḥukki</i>] bread”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Proverbs 30:8 | feed me [ hatrifeni ] my allotted portion” | Eruvin 18b:15 | <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the dove came in to him in the evening, <b>and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf, plucked off [<i>taraf</i>];</b> so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth” (Genesis 8:11)? <b>The dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let my food be bitter as an olive but given into Your hand, and let it not be sweet as honey but dependent upon flesh and blood.</b> He adds this explanation: <b>Here it is written: <i>Taraf</i>. And there it is written:</b> “Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; <b>feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Proverbs 30:8 | which is written: “Feed me [ hatrifeni ] with my allotted portion” | Sanhedrin 108b:17 | With regard to the verse: <b>“And in her mouth was an olive branch plucked off [<i>taraf</i> ]”</b> (Genesis 8:11), <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, may my sustenance be bitter as the olive and dependent on Your hands, and not sweet as honey and dependent on the hands of flesh and blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that <i>taraf</i> is a term</b> that indicates <b>sustenance?</b> The Gemara answers: It is inferred from that <b>which is written: “Feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] with my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8). |
| Proverbs 30:10 | that which is written: “Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty” | Pesachim 87b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty”</b> (Proverbs 30:10), <b>and it is</b> then <b>written</b> in the next verse: <b>“There is a generation that curses its father, and does not bless its mother”</b> (Proverbs 30:11). Is it <b>because they curse their father and do not bless their mother</b> that <b>you should not slander</b> them? Clearly that is absurd. |
| Proverbs 30:11 | “There is a generation that curses its father, and does not bless its mother” | Pesachim 87b:16 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Slander not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty”</b> (Proverbs 30:10), <b>and it is</b> then <b>written</b> in the next verse: <b>“There is a generation that curses its father, and does not bless its mother”</b> (Proverbs 30:11).

| Proverbs 30:15 | “The horseleech has two daughters: Give, give” | Avodah Zarah17a:7 | § In connection to the earlier mention of heresy and the ruling authorities, the Gemara cites a verse: <b>“The horseleech has two daughters: Give, give”</b> (Proverbs 30:15). <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“give, give”? Mar Ukva says:</b> This is the <b>voice</b> of <b>the two daughters who cry</b> out <b>from Gehenna</b> due to their suffering; <b>and</b> they are the ones who <b>say in this world: Give, give,</b> demanding dues and complete allegiance. <b>And who are they?</b> They are <b>heresy and the ruling authority. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says: The voice of Gehenna cries</b> out <b>and says: Bring me two daughters who cry and say in this world: Give, give.</b> |
| Proverbs 30:19 | which it is written: “The way of an eagle in the sky” | Chullin 139b:9 | The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so,</b> then if <b>one found a nest in the sky,</b> e.g., in a case where a bird carries the nest as it flies, about <b>which it is written: “The way of an eagle in the sky”</b> (Proverbs 30:19), one should <b>also be obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> away the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b> The Gemara responds: The sky <b>is called “the way of an eagle,”</b> but <b>it is not called: A way,</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> manner. The sea, by contrast, is referred to simply as: A way. |
| Proverbs 30:19 | As it is stated: “The way of a ship in the midst of the sea” | Shabbat 83b:6 | <strong>MISHNA:</strong> This is another mishna that digresses from the central topic of this tractate. It, too, is based on an allusion from the Bible. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that the ship is ritually pure,</b> in the sense that it cannot become impure? <b>As it is stated: “The way of a ship in the midst of the sea”</b> (Proverbs 30:19). |
| Proverbs 30:20 | “She eats and wipes her mouth and says: I have done no wickedness” | Ketubot 13a:12 | <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>speaking</b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>Ze’eiri said:</b> It means that <b>she secluded herself</b> with a man and it is unknown whether she engaged in intercourse. <b>Rav Asi said:</b> It means that <b>she engaged in intercourse. Granted, according to Ze’eiri, that is</b> why the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case employing the term <b>speaking,</b> as it is certain only that they were in seclusion. Perhaps all they did was speak. <b>However, according to Rav Asi, what is</b> the reason the mishna employed the term <b>speaking</b> if the reference is to intercourse? The Gemara answers: The mishna employed <b>a euphemism, as it is written</b> with regard to licentious women: <b>“She eats and wipes her mouth and says: I have done no wickedness”</b> (Proverbs 30:20). The verse euphemistically ascribes the act of intercourse to the mouth instead of to the appropriate body part. |
| Proverbs 30:20 | she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says: I have done no wickedness” | Ketubot 65b:6 | <b>The mishna states: And she eats with him</b> from <b>Shabbat evening</b> to Shabbat evening. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that it means actual <b>eating, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which is taught: She eats. However, according to the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>sexual relations, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>She eats?</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>a euphemism, as it is written:</b> “So is the way of an adulterous woman; <b>she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says: I have done no wickedness”</b> (Proverbs 30:20). |
| Proverbs 30:20 | she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says I have done no wickedness” | Yoma 75a:7 | The Gemara asks: And <b>according to the one who said</b> that it is referring to forbidden <b>relations, but</b> isn’t it <b>written “which we ate”?</b> The Gemara answers: The Torah <b>employed a euphemistic expression.</b> Eating is used as a euphemism for sexual relations, <b>as it is written:</b> “So is the way of an adulterous woman; <b>she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says I have done no wickedness”</b> (Proverbs 30:20). <b>And according to the one who said</b> it is referring to <b>fish, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“for nothing”?</b> The people <b>brought the fish from</b> the river, which was <b>ownerless property,</b> since the Egyptians obviously would not have given them free food. <b>The Master said: When the Jews drew water</b> from the river, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, prepared little fish for them in the water.</b> They swam <b>into their jugs.</b> |
| Proverbs 30:31 | which is written: “The thigh-belted greyhound [ zarzir ], or the he-goat, and the king against whom none can rise” | Sanhedrin 82b:7 | § With regard to the same matter, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The thigh-belted greyhound [<i>zarzir</i>], or the he-goat, and the king against whom none can rise”</b> (Proverbs 30:31)? <b>That wicked</b> Zimri <b>engaged in four hundred and twenty-four,</b> the numerical value of the word <i>zarzir</i>, <b>acts of intercourse</b> with Cozbi <b>that day. And Pinehas waited until his strength waned</b> from all that activity. <b>And</b> Pinehas <b>did not know that</b> it was not necessary to wait that long because <b>the king against whom none can rise,</b> a reference to the Holy One, Blessed be He, was <b>with him.</b> |
| Proverbs 30:32 | that which is written: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [ zamota ], lay your hand over your mouth” | Berakhot 63b:20 | Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [<i>zamota</i>], lay your hand over your mouth”</b> (Proverbs 30:32)? <b>Anyone who abases himself over matters of Torah,</b> asking questions despite the shame he feels for his ignorance, <b>will ultimately be exalted. And if he muzzles [<i>zamam</i>] himself</b> due to embarrassment, he will end up with his <b>hand over</b> his <b>mouth,</b> unable to answer. |
| Proverbs 30:32 | because it is stated: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [ zammota ], lay your hand over your mouth” | Niddah 27a:14 | <b>Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to this incident: <b>A person should say a matter even</b> as obvious <b>as this</b> one, <b>and one should not be silent in the presence of his teacher,</b> despite the possibility that other people might laugh at him, <b>because it is stated: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [<i>zammota</i>], lay your hand over your mouth”</b> (Proverbs 30:32). One who acts “foolishly” over matters of Torah by not hesitating to issue statements that might be ridiculed will ultimately be exalted and lifted up. Conversely, one who muzzles [<i>zamam</i>] himself due to embarrassment will end up with his hand over his mouth, unable to answer questions that are posed to him. |
| Proverbs 30:33 | that which is written: “For the churning of milk brings forth curd, and the wringing of the nose [ af ] brings forth blood, so the forcing of wrath [ appayim ] brings forth strife” | Berakhot 63b:16 | <b>In the school of Rabbi Yannai they said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “For the churning of milk brings forth curd, and the wringing of the nose [<i>af</i>] brings forth blood, so the forcing of wrath [<i>appayim</i>] brings forth strife”</b> (Proverbs 30:33)? |
| Proverbs 31:1 | “The words of King Lemuel, the burden with which his mother corrected him” | Sanhedrin 70b:2 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of wine. Referring to the verse that states: <b>“The words of King Lemuel, the burden with which his mother corrected him”</b> (Proverbs 31:1), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> when Solomon’s <b>mother</b> Bathsheba saw Solomon engaged in excessive drinking, she <b>bound him to a pillar</b> to have him flogged. <b>And she said to him: “What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?”</b> (Proverbs 31:2). She meant: <b>“What, my son?” Everyone knows that your father,</b> David, <b>was a God-fearing</b> man, and <b>now,</b> when they see you sin, <b>they will</b> all <b>say</b> that <b>his mother caused him</b> to drink, i.e., that you engage in these behaviors because you are my son. |
| Proverbs 31:2 | And she said to him: “What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?” | Sanhedrin 70b:2 | § The Gemara continues its discussion of wine. Referring to the verse that states: <b>“The words of King Lemuel, the burden with which his mother corrected him”</b> (Proverbs 31:1), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> when Solomon’s <b>mother</b> Bathsheba saw Solomon engaged in excessive drinking, she <b>bound him to a pillar</b> to have him flogged. <b>And she said to him: “What, my son?

| Proverbs 31:4 | nor for princes [ rozenim ] to say: Where is strong drink” | Sanhedrin 42a:10 | The mishna teaches that if the court <b>found</b> it fit to <b>acquit</b> the defendant during the deliberations, as all or a majority of them agree to acquit him, they excuse him. The mishna further teaches that the judges would not drink wine all day. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> they did <b>not</b> drink <b>wine? Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that it is because <b>the verse states:</b> “It is not for kings to drink wine, <b>nor for princes [<i>rozenim</i>] to say: Where is strong drink”</b> (Proverbs 31:4). Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina explains: This is a directive to <b>those who deal with the secret of the world [<i>berazo shel olam</i>],</b> i.e., such stringent matters: <b>Do not become drunk.</b> |
| Proverbs 31:4 | “It is not for kings, O Lemoel, it is not for kings to drink wine; | Sanhedrin 70b:5 | It is further stated there: <b>“It is not for kings, O Lemoel, it is not for kings to drink wine;</b> nor for princes to say: Where is strong drink?” (Proverbs 31:4). The Gemara provides an explanation of the meaning of each part of this verse. <b>“It is not for kings”:</b> Bathsheba <b>said to</b> her son Solomon: <b>What have you to do with kings who drink wine and become intoxicated and say: Why [<i>lamma</i>] do we need God [<i>El</i>]?</b> The Gemara continues to explain the verse. <b>“Nor for princes [<i>rozenim</i>] to say: Where is strong drink?”</b> This means that <b>one</b> like Solomon, <b>to whom all the secrets [<i>razei</i>] of the world are revealed, should he drink wine and become intoxicated?</b> Alternatively, <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this part of the verse should be understood as follows: <b>One</b> like Solomon, <b>to whom all the princes of the world rise early</b> to come <b>to his door, should he drink wine and become intoxicated?</b> |
| Proverbs 31:6 | for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul” | Berakhot 57a:21 | The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan taught: One who sees any kind of drink in a dream it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen, <b>except for wine,</b> as <b>there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is</b> one <b>who drinks</b> wine <b>and it is</b> a <b>good</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15), <b>and there is</b> one <b>who drinks it</b> in a dream <b>and it is</b> a <b>bad</b> omen <b>for him, as it is stated: “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto the bitter in soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). |
| Proverbs 31:6 | as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, | Eruvin 65a:20 | <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: Wine was created only in order to comfort mourners</b> in their distress, <b>and to reward the wicked</b> in this world so they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish,</b> and wine to the bitter of soul. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more” (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” refers to the wicked, who will perish from the world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners. |
| Proverbs 31:6 | as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter in soul” | Sanhedrin 43a:10 | <b>And furthermore,</b> another question is raised along similar lines: With regard to <b>that which Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The court <b>gives one who is being led out to be killed a grain [<i>koret</i>] of frankincense in a cup of wine in order to confuse his mind</b> and thereby minimize his suffering from the fear of his impending death, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter in soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The prominent women of Jerusalem would donate</b> this drink <b>and bring</b> it to those being led out to be killed. The question is: If <b>these prominent women did not donate</b> this drink, <b>from whom</b> is it taken? The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>this</b> question, it <b>is certainly reasonable</b> that this drink should be taken <b>from the community, as it is written: “Give [<i>tenu</i>]</b> strong drink,” in the plural, indicating that it should come <b>from them,</b> the community. |
| Proverbs 31:6 | as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter of soul” | Sanhedrin 70a:12 | § The Gemara’s discussion turns to wine in general. <b>Rav Ḥanan says: Wine was created in the world only to comfort mourners</b> in their distress, <b>and to reward the wicked</b> in this world so that they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter of soul”</b> (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” is referring to the wicked, who will perish from this world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners. |
| Proverbs 31:8 | “Open your mouth for the mute” | Bava Batra41a:5 | The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the mishna to state this, <b>lest you say: That man</b> had actually <b>purchased this land</b> that he possessed, <b>and he had a bill</b> of sale, <b>but it was lost. And the reason that he said</b> that he is in possession of the land because no person ever said anything to him, is that he <b>thought: If I say</b> that the prior owner <b>sold me this land,</b> the court will <b>say to me: Show</b> us <b>your bill</b> of sale. <b>Therefore,</b> being that this may be the case, <b>let us say to him: Perhaps you had a bill</b> of sale <b>and</b> it <b>was lost.</b> In a case <b>such as this,</b> one would think that <b>it is</b> a situation where the court should apply the verse: <b>“Open your mouth for the mute”</b> (Proverbs 31:8), meaning the court should advise a litigant of his possible claims, because perhaps he does not state them out of ignorance. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not advance this claim on his behalf, and if he does not make the claim of his own volition, he does not establish the presumption of ownership. |
| Proverbs 31:8 | “Open your mouth for the mute” | Gittin 37b:6 | <b>When they would come before Rav</b> with a case where a creditor who did not have a <i>prosbol</i> was demanding payment of a debt after the Sabbatical Year, <b>he</b> would <b>say to</b> the creditor: <b>Did you have any <i>prosbol</i> and it was lost?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> a case <b>where</b> the directive of the verse: <b>“Open your mouth for the mute”</b> (Proverbs 31:8) is applicable; this is not considered an intervention on behalf of one party, as it is only providing assistance for someone who was unaware of a claim that he should make. |
| Proverbs 31:8 | “Open your mouth for the mute” | Ketubot 36a:9 | <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> who holds that a woman who, in response to a claim concerning her virginity, is believed if she says that she was raped after her betrothal and therefore does not lose her marriage contract. <b>And that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says that a woman is not believed if she makes that claim, and therefore she loses her marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> accepts her contention in a case <b>where she claims</b> that she was raped after the betrothal; however, in a case <b>where she did not claim</b> that that was the case, <b>did you hear</b> that <b>he</b> accepts her contention? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, since Rabban Gamliel said</b> she is <b>believed</b> when she states that she was raped after betrothal, the deaf-mute and the imbecile are also believed even though they are unable to make the claim, as in a cases <b>like that,</b> it <b>is</b> a case of: <b>“Open your mouth for the mute”</b> (Proverbs 31:8). When a person lacks the capacity to proffer the claim on his own, the court makes the claim on her behalf. |
| Proverbs 31:14 | about himself: “She is like the merchant-ships; she brings her food from afar” | Bava Metzia84b:5 | <b>One day,</b> the wife of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>said to her daughter: Go</b> and <b>check on your father</b> and see <b>what he is doing now.</b> The daughter <b>came</b> to her father, who <b>said to her: Go</b> and <b>tell your mother</b> that <b>ours is greater than theirs,</b> i.e., my current financial status is greater than that of your father’s household. <b>He read</b> the verse <b>about himself: “She is like the merchant-ships; she brings her food from afar”</b> (Proverbs 31:14). As he was unhindered by his wife from going to the study hall, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>ate and drank and became healthy and went out to the study hall.</b> |
| Proverbs 31:24 | “She made a cloak and sold it, | Pesachim 50b:6 | <b>The Sages taught: One who anticipates</b> receiving <b>the earnings of his wife or</b> of <b>a mill never sees a sign of blessing</b> from them. The Gemara explains: <b>Earnings of his wife</b> is referring to a case where she spins thread for others and charges by weight on <b>a scale</b> (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). The profit is small and it is demeaning to walk in public to solicit customers. Earnings of the <b>mill</b> is referring to a hand mill for which people pay <b>rent</b> and grind their grain. In that case too, the profits are meager. <b>However, if a woman works and sells</b> the product of her labor, <b>the verse praises her, as it is written</b> about a woman of valor: <b>“She made a cloak and sold it,</b> and delivered a belt to the peddler” (Proverbs 31:24). |
| Proverbs 31:26 | that which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of loving-kindness is on her tongue” | Berakhot 10a:12 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> explanations of other verses <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of loving-kindness is on her tongue”</b> (Proverbs 31:26)? The Sages explain that this chapter discusses the wisdom of Torah and those who engage in its study, so <b>with reference to whom did Solomon say this verse? He said this</b> verse <b>about none other than his father, David,</b> who was the clearest example of one who opens his mouth in wisdom, and <b>who resided in five worlds</b> or stages of life <b>and</b> his soul <b>said a song</b> of praise corresponding to each of them. Five times David said: “Bless the Lord, O my soul,” each corresponding to a different stage of life. |
| Proverbs 31:26 | which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and a Torah of kindness is on her tongue” | Sukkah 49b:13 | <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>any person who has grace about him, it is certain that he is God-fearing, as it is stated: “But the kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him.”</b> When one sees that a certain individual is endowed with grace and kindness, one can be certain that he is a God-fearing person. <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and a Torah of kindness is on her tongue”</b> (Proverbs 31:26)? The Gemara asks: <b>Is there, then, a Torah of kindness and a Torah that is not of kindness? Rather,</b> it is <b>Torah</b> studied <b>for its own sake that is a Torah of kindness,</b> as one studies it wholeheartedly; and it is Torah studied <b>not for its own sake</b> but for some ulterior motive <b>that is a Torah that is not of kindness. Some say</b> that it is <b>Torah</b> studied in order <b>to teach it</b> to others <b>that is a Torah of kindness;</b> it is Torah studied <b>with</b> the intent of <b>not teaching it</b> to others <b>that is a Torah that is not of kindness.</b> |
| Proverbs 31:29 | which is written: “Many daughters have done valiantly, but you excel above them all” | Sanhedrin 20a:2 | <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Many daughters have done valiantly, but you excel above them all”</b> (Proverbs 31:29)? <b>“Many daughters have done valiantly”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Joseph and Boaz. “But you excel above them all”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Palti, son of Laish,</b> who exceeded Joseph and Boaz in restraint, as discussed above. |
| Proverbs 31:30 | which is written: “Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain, | Sanhedrin 20a:3 | <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain,</b> but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised” (Proverbs 31:30). <b>“Grace is deceitful”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Joseph. “And beauty is vain”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Boaz. “Who fears the Lord, she shall be praised”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Palti, son of Laish,</b> who did not sin with Michal. Although the behavior of Joseph and Boaz is commendable, it is “deceitful” and “vain” relative to that of Palti ben Laish. |
| Proverbs 31:30 | “Grace is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised” | Taanit 26b:5 | <b>And the daughters of Jerusalem would go out and dance in the vineyards. And what would they say? Young man, please lift up your eyes and see what you choose for yourself</b> for a wife. <b>Do not set your eyes toward beauty, but set your eyes toward</b> a good <b>family,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Grace is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised”</b> (Proverbs 31:30), <b>and it</b> further <b>says: “Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates”</b> (Proverbs 31:31). |
| Proverbs 31:31 | says: “Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates” | Taanit 26b:5 | <b>And the daughters of Jerusalem would go out and dance in the vineyards. And what would they say?
